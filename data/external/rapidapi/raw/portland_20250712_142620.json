      "story": "Stationary Lights Over Portland OR Around 1960 Talking with a friend about the recent sightings (April 29/30, 2006), I thought the following might be of topical inerest although it was a long time ago and I don't recall the exact date.  Looking out of our picture window towards the SE, on a hill in SW Portland, my Dad, my Mother and myself saw in the evening sky what I remember to be 3 stationary oblong lights hovering over the Wilamette Valley.   They remained there at least for 10 minutes, and my father called  -- I believe -- the Oregonian to report it.  I remember that the paper said they had received a number of calls on it.  I also remember that the paper printed a squib about it after that, basically saying that stationary lights were observed over the city and that the Air Force was notified, and that the Air Force indicated that it would look into it.   I don't recall any followup on the story. I just wish I had more of the facts. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

It was made of several bright balls of light. I would have thought it was one big object until one of the balls of lights came out of it's top position, flew down to one of the other balls and started swirling around it! It was like they were playing with each other. The light returned to it's exact top position, the object hovered for awhile longer and then in the blink of an eye they burst off to the right and dissapeared out of sight. When they took off it was unbelievably fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Bright Aqua ball of Light over Hillsboro, Oregon - viewed from Cornelius Pass - Danced in the sky I heard coyotees howling very loudly outside so I opened the door to see if I could see them in our yard. I walked out on to our porch (which is on the second story of the house) and I looked acrossed the street (which is on a right angle from our house)when I realized the sound was coming from that direction to see if the coyotees were that way. Out of the corner of my left eye I caught something in the sky that looked bright. It was \"falling\" in a straight line from left to right yet at a downward angle, it appeared to be in the sky over the Beaverton or Hillsboro Area. It was just above the line of a tree in our yard, and over the lights of the town. My first reaction was that it looked like a HUGE shooting star but then my brain connected that it was not white but a very bright Aqua (blue green) color.. not a regular blue.... and it was pretty big.... much larger than any falling star I've ever seen. Sort of a firey looking bright aqua colored light. I yelled for my family because the door was still open and I really didn't know what I was seeing. It lasted long enough for me to think they would actually be able to get to where I was at and see it, but at the last moments ...as it seemed to get to it lowest point it suddenly swooped back up in a circle (rounding over itself and coming back around), then in a kind of figure eight and then basically made a bunch of very eratic moves...in a really much faster and crazier pattern. honestly the closest description I can give is that it looked like a ballon losing its air... a kind of crazy dance right at the end... and then it just disappeared. Before it did the circles though it was going very straight and fast at an angle towards the ground. It was very clear .... no clouds skewing my view..... and I saw it distinctly. I don't know what it was, so I won't even speculate, but I can say I For SURE saw what I saw and know it wasn't any kind of plane or ballon or regular aircraft I've ever witnessed before. It left me feeling pretty odd since it was so big and in such plain site. No matter what it ends up being I'd love an explaination!",

I wasn't going to report this but since I see from this site's homepage that there have been others sightings in my area, I tought that I should relate my experience before all the others details are posted.  I live in a community southwest of Portland, Oregon.  While I was outside looking at the night sky my attention was drawn to an object just NE of my zenith near the head of Ursa Major.  The object was very faint, nearly transparent but certainly had some form.  It was difficuly for me to judge it's size but I estimate that it was approximately 1 degree of arc.  It's shape was either rectangular or oval.  The object being very faint, it was my impression that it was purposely difficult to see.  Without it's movement, I may not have seen it at all.  But once \"locked on\"  I was able to follow it.  The object was mostly black either because it was transparent against the dark sky or made of a dark material.  I'm not sure which.  But it did have a very subtle green and red glow.  The object moved in a straight line from Ursa Major due east past the \"guardians\" made a quick jog to the north and resumed an easterly course.  I lost it soon after this course correction in the murkiness of the city lights and did not see it again.  I estimate that the object covered about 50 degrees of sky in about the 4 seconds that I tracked it in front of me.  It made no sound.  I can't really explain what I saw.  I googled \"ufo reporting\" in hopes of finding something out and was pleased to see that the Portland area was at the top of your site although my event was a few nights earlier.   I hope this information helps and I'll be checking back to see if any conclusions are made.  I'd love to know what the heck it was.",

      "story": "The UFO that I saw at 1 PM thursday the 27th of april 2006, hovering over downtown portland, was a white, rather opaque, imperfect circular blob light ball with what was either a black circular ball directly below it, or maybe a black helicopter . It was aprox. 30-50 feet diameter, from side to side, by my estimate to the downtown Burnside bridge area it was hovering over. It was a single object, and it did not move while I observed it except for a slight unjulation which gave it the \"imperfect\" circular shape that I just mentioned. My astute girlfriend also observed this strange object, at the same instance as myself, as well as earlier that morning, by herself, around 10:30 A.M . This is certainly not the first \"UFO\" that I have seen here in my 1 year in Portland, Oregon. I have seen 1 black triangle near the Mall 205 exit off of the 205 freeway, as well as several other pasty light ball objects hovering over downtown Portland in clear blue mid day last fall, October 2005, 1 orange/metalic orb august 2005, and 1 diamond shaped black, brown, and grey object weaving eratically in and out of the clouds and then zipping off, early april 2006!

They were all the same size(about 4 times the size of large visible planet) and moving at the same speed (slower than low airplane) in a loosely formed line. They were about 1/2 to 3/4 less bright than an airplane headlight, but soft and diffused, almost fuzzy at edges. They were not flashing but barely pulsating with no pattern, and there was no sound. We really had no sense of how far away they were or how big, it was impossible to distinguish. They were heading NE then took a wide turn towards SE. They appeared to be directly over downtown area. After their turn they slowed to a stop, and stayed without moving for a few minutes, then they slowly began to get smaller/ fade. They still were not moving, unless exactly away from us (I lined them up with a building to check for motion.

      "story": "I saw at least six bright glowing, orange in color objects in the sky over the city of Portland on Saturday night, 4-29-06. I was driving my car and coming into Downtown Portland from the 405 Freeway. I was heading to take the Couch St./Burnside St. Exit. Just before I approached the exit, I noticed to my left in the sky at about a forty five degree angle two very bright, orange in color objects. One was at a complete standstill. There was another object, closely approaching very slowly as if to meet up with the object standing still. It came from the south. When it reached the first object it then was at a standstill with the first object. Then coming from the North, a little farther left from the two objects that were at a stand still, was another object which looked exactly the same as the first two. As it neared the first two objects, the first two objects started to move away very, very slowly to the south as the third object was heading closer to them from the north. I noticed an airplane, which came from the north and heading south near the now, three objects. I couldn't tell if the airplane was going to fly under the objects or just near them.  I also wasn't sure if the airplane was flying towards them to check them out or if it was just there coincidentally at the time.  The airplane was smaller than a passenger airplane and looked to be flying considerably low. I could see the lights and the shape of this craft and it definitely was an airplane. The other objects were not like this airplane at all. The objects looked like they were a little higher than the airplane. I really can't say how high the plane or objects were. The plane flew past the objects that were heading south.  Then I noticed a fourth object coming from the north just behind the third object as I took the Couch St Exit and turned left onto Couch St. heading east. I followed the four objects as they were heading in a S/SE direction. I was still heading east on Couch St. The four objects were flying very, very slowly now to my right at about a forty five degree angle.  I came to a stop sign on Couch and I looked directly up from my front windshield at about a 90 degree angle and noticed two more objects directly above my car. They were bright, orange in color objects that appeared to be fiery, or on fire. I really tried to get a focus on them, but could only notice the glow and haze which seemed to be in motion, almost like a candle\u2019s flickering. The two objects were at a stand still. I know this because I was at a complete stop, too.  About one minute later the two objects proceeded very, very slowly to the S/SE. They also started to change in size of glow. They got smaller and then bigger again as they headed S/SE.   When they got smaller they looked more like stars.  The other four objects had  just left my view as I noticed the two objects that were directly above me.   A few blocks down I came to another stop.  I kept waving to cars on my right to continue after their stop as I was at a four way stop.  Me and my two friends were watching the four earlier objects as they moved slowly, S/SE above a  white building that had  some  radar like items and other things on top of the building.  The objects looked like they were much higher than the building as their glow got smaller as they moved S/SE.  We were at this stop sign watching for about three minutes or so.  Then we proceeded down Couch street to NW Broadway and along the way would still notice the objects as they headed S/SE.  I turned right at NW Broadway and headed into a parking lot that used to be a Burger King and my friend called 911.  They gave her the phone number to the UFO Center.  I called the UFO Center in Washington State and gave my report.  As I gave my report I was watching the last two objects  that at one point was right above my car, fly off in the distance heading S/SE.  They looked like two stars flying away in the distance with one on top of the other.  They looked to be about an inch apart as they drifted still very, very slowly and then eventually fading away.

Conditions were light hazy skies to the horizons with views of constellations above. I saw four red lights moving north to south at a slow speed. The lights traveled in pairs of two. In each pair, one red light angled higher than the other spaced by a degree or two, followed by a larger space (up to 5 degrees), and then followed by the other pair of two. These two pairs of lights did not break their formation and continued south until they vanished from sight. They were as bright as Venus and seem to be around 10 thousand feet. As I was viewing these four objects come and go another pair of two red lights were slowing moving north to south above in or around downtown Portland. These two did seem to slow down couple times or at least move to the west. I viewed this pair for a couple minutes before vanishing in the southern horizon.  There were no objects or lights emitted, no sound, no vapor trail, did not change colors.

They were traveling east over the West Hills then made a turn south by the US Bancorp Tower.  They kept moving and then seemed to stop (still over south downtown) and did not move until their lights just seemed to go out.

The rear of my apartment faces southwest.  I have a clear view of downtown Portland from this direction.  I am also to see the West Hills from my windows.  I only saw two lights and I have narrowed the vicinity of downtown to above the Brewery blocks (between N.W. 11th and N.W.  13th and N.W.  Burnside and N.W.  Davis streets).  It traveled very slowly, gliding almost, east past the USBancorp tower (between 5th and 6th avenue and Burnside) just passing it (but higher than the building, which is 470 feet approximately).  About three blocks after the tower it slowly turned south.  It continued for I would say a mile to a mile and a half.  The lights were still very clear, just a little faded.    2)  The angle of the lights was about 60 degrees.  These lights lasted about ten minutes or so in duration, without breaking or flashing.  These lights were amber in hue, but as I really studied them, I noticed that one of the lights might have been more red (I believe that there were three lights in a very small cluster).   My husband was with me at the time, and he will be filing an individual report this week.  We both stood there and watched these and discussed what it might be.  I guess we were trying to rationalize what we were seeing above a major metropolitan area.  Nothing made sense, nor does now.  They could have very easily been attached in some way though, for moving that slow, with absolutely no sound.  It is very quiet where I live, so we can hear anything flying in the sky.  There is a helipad five blocks away and we can hear them for a good ten to twelve blocks.  Especially that night, it was late in the evening and our building was silent.  There was hardly any traffic going by. I have already given my consent to an interview with the Oregonian.  You might also think about calling the Portland Tribune, it is an independent local newspaper.    Let me know if you want that picture, I'll take it tonight and then one in the morning for a daylight shot. I have enclosed a map of where I live and other points of reference.

My friend was exiting Couch Street and that was when she called my attention and another friends attention to the out if the ordinary view outside. When she called my attention, I could see the objects but now there were four of them. The objects were orange and glowing at the same time and they were at a complete stop. But then they all started to move S/SE. They were moving very slowly. As my friend turned left on NW Couch street, she slowed down to get a better look at them. She kept on going straight and on about 14th and Couch Street, she came to a complete stop. All three of us that were in the car were able to get a better view of the glowing objects. They were two more directly above the car. I noticed two of them. They were at a complete stop for about a minute or so. Then the objects started moving S/SE following the previous four objects. They were moving very slowly as if drifting. They were glowing orange, but it was hard to see any definite shape. The glow was in slow motion. One of the objects got smaller and then bigger again. After they started to move S/SE, we proceeded E on Couch to 10th street. On 10th street, we were at a three way stop. Four of the objects were above a white building. We watched them for at least three minutes. We proceeded E to NW Broadway were we turned right into an abandoned building's parking lot. My friend in the passenger seat called 911. They told her to call the UFO center in Wa State. The driver of the car called the UFO center and made a report. I watched the objects at this point, but they faded away as they were headed S/SE.

One of them was at a complete standstill as the other approached. When the one caught up with the first one, another appeared from the left and headed toward the two which were now both at a standstill.  As the third one neared the first two, all three objects started and maintained a very, very slow flight pattern. The first two were now going the same way they had come before the third one finally caught up. We followed all three and then noticed a fourth one appear from the left and it finally caught up with the other three objects which appeared to be heading south. They all looked like bright orange glowing objects. They almost appeared to be on fire. They looked like big stars. They got smaller, then bigger, and then smaller again.  As we followed the four objects we had to stop at a stop sign. We looked up and directly above our car there were two more of them. We could still see the first four to our right as they were still flying very slowly.  The two above our car were at a complete standstill.  About one minute later, they then started towards the direction of the first four and moved very, very slowly. We followed them as they appeared to be heading in a SE direction like the first four. At first they were glowing like big stars and then got smaller.  One looked like it was above the other as they left slowly in the distance. We first started seeing at least two of the objects as we were going to take the Couch St/Burnside exit from the 405. We took the exit and went left.  This took us to Couch St. We followed the objects all the way down Couch St to Broadway. We then took a right and parked in a lot to see the final two as they disappeared.

      "story": "Cloaked light disc pretends to be a cloud formation. At this time I lived in the northwest as I grew up in Oregon City Area.  I was outside on my back porch located in the Gresham Oregon area. My back porch faced west towards downtown Portland Oregon.  It was a mostly clear day a little after 1pm I believe.  I noticed what looked like a cloud formation moving toward me from downtown Portland area.  This storm front caught my attention because it didn\u2019t look like any I had ever seen before.  It was perfectly rounded with no stray clouds.  There was a bright orange cloud at the center.  The formation took up my entire westerly view.    As I watched it approach my home I noticed it was moving faster then a normal cloud system. Once this cloud system passed over my home I looked back at it and could see exactly what this bright light in the center of this mass of clouds was.  It was a glowing light disc as bright as the sun.  There were no other lights only one solid disc of yellow white light.I even caught a picture of this light disc but somehow got erased from my mini disc in my phone.  This experience changed my life forever.  The possibility\u2019s are endless as this craft apparently had the ability to either attract clouds to it magnetically, or project a cloud hologram around it.  This light disc did not make a sound and was at the standard altitude of clouds.  What\u2019s even more amazing is air traffic constantly flies into PDX over that area.  That same year I had two other amazing experiences.  In my research I have come to learn these exotic technologies have been hidden from the public going back Thousands of years.  I wondered why they would fly this object over a heavily populated area.  The only answer I could come up with is that they wanted to test there cloaking technology.  I often wonder if I am the only one who noticed it that day.  I assume nobody thought anything of it and thought it was just some clouds in the sky.",

      "story": "Seeing is Believing:  Sighting Over Texas Coastline. I had recently started star gazing often at night because of a high occurrence of shooting stars in the area and sometimes in the early morning hours I would see satellites or space debris reflecting through the air.  Recently Trump had threatened his nuclear weapon button was bigger in response to North Korea Nuclear tension via Twitter so my assumption for a while for what I had viewed that night was it was a defense test or Space-X Rocket Launch from the Brownsville, TX, location.  I did not report this incident initially, as coming from a military family and having been educated in Mechanical Engineering, I assumed what I saw was a missile defense deflection test in preparation for any foreign nuclear attack. I walked outside and looked around the sky trying to allow my eyes to adjust to the darkness which would allow me to see stars and satellites easier as sometimes being next to a larger city the stars can be harder to locate.  The night sky was clear enough from cloud coverage for me to be able to locate stars in any direction.  About 2 minutes after being outside I noticed a group of 3 stars around 72 degrees east that were brighter than when my head had panned that direction previously.  Now visually fixated on these objects, I noticed that the objects were tracking NE in regards to my position and phone compass.  Being the large pessimist I am, I tried to downplay what I was seeing and assumed them to be air planes of some type.  But there were no strobe lights or jet sounds so I thought these to be space debris for a moment.  As a few seconds go by, I realize that it seems as if these equidistant 3 white orb objects are traveling in triangle formation.  There roughly at abou! t 35 degrees upwards in relation to my point of view.  Only about 10 or 15 seconds into the ordeal I made a split second decision not to go grab my phone (stupid) in a selfish act to keep watching the event unfold as I had never seen anything like this before but being someone well versed in mathematics and engineering was convincing myself with logical thinking what I was seeing was nothing to be excited about.  Calmly, I watched at about 45 seconds into the entire event as a middle orb seemed to appear out of thin air.  The objects began to track back towards the eastward direction slowly but changing directions simultaneously with each other moments after the arrival of the new orb.  Remaining equidistant to the new object the three whitish orbs slowly started de-accelerating to a full stop in coordination with the new orb the air.  Levitating there for a few more moments as the event reached the 1 minute mark.  The original 3 orb objects at this time started moving around as i! f they were trying to push this new orb that appeared by directing themselves underneath the new orb.  The original orbs were starting to move around the new orb erratically unlike anything I have ever seen before. Zig Zag patterns is the best description but staying equidistant from the new orb object.  At this time I noticed strobe lights of airplanes coming from a local air force base heading towards the objects coming from the Southeast direction at 116 degrees.  As the jets made it to around 75 degree east track the new orb surrounded by the original moving orbs started to glow orange slowly.  Over a period of 20 seconds the new orb grew to be larger and larger and seemed to gain luminosity as bright as the sun in the night sky but only in that area of the sky.  It looked like an atmospheric re-entry of a large object but the other objects around it seemed to speed up during this process.  The orb toward the right of formation shot off faster than I have ever seen anything travel in my entire life.  It covered around 6 inches of sky in less than! a 1 second span.  I assumed this object was traveling mach 5 or 6 but there was no explosion or sounds.  All I could hear were the jets at this time that were now approaching it within my range of view and most definitely theirs.  It was obvious these jets were tracking these objects.  The orb that traveled away from the formation went like a chord through a circle in regards to my visible atmosphere.  In less mathematical descriptive terms, the object was like if you were to have shot a bullet through the top portion of an orange.  The object was moving so fast it almost looked as a shooting star would have in regards to speed but this object was more gathered and had no comet tail or sparks.  The new glowing orb faded and each orb slowly one by one flickered/disappeared from plain site.  Whether these objects just traveled beyond the atmosphere slowly or not..they just vanished. After not being able to confirm that there was a space x launch and others in the area reported seeing the same thing I took it upon myself to report it.  As a credible witness soon to earn a degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a minor in both Mathematics and Psychology\u2026 What I saw is definitely artificial. I would assume at this time it is advanced defensive or just raw technology possessed by the United States Government being it was so closely after the nuclear arms arguments.  This is why I did not report it for a while but now I realize if it is an adversary that has the technology.  These objects are being reported around US military bases frequently.  Reports like this might be useful into tracking the origin.  Regardless of my opinions..it does not change the visual event that occurred.  So I decided to come forward with the report even though people usually are shunned for this type of thing.",

At first it appeared to be one large V shaped object flying with nose of the V pointed to our left. The object consisted of several balls of white lights. We watched the object for several minutes in amazement trying to figure out what it was. The Portland Jetport is to the right of where we were looking. My family has lived in the house we were standing in front of for decades and I have seen thousands of planes fly over our house throughout the years, the sound when they fly over is very loud and shakes the house, people who aren't use to it would cover their ears. I could hear no sound coming from the object. There were several balls of light in the V formation, my approximate would be 7. All of a sudden one of the balls of light came out of it's position in the top of the formation and quickly flew down towards a ball that was in the lowest section, it started to zig zag around it, almost as if it was playing with it. The ball of light in the lower section came out of it's place and they both zipped around, left, right, up and down. The balls of light then went back into their exact position, then at an amazing speed they zipped to the left out of sight.  This was the first and the only sighting I have ever had. I am 100 % sure that it was not a plane, but I have no idea what it was. My best guess is that it was truly from a world other then my own, or something government or military related that the public is unaware of. I feel privileged to have had this experience and am intrigued at the possibilities that our own people or something out there has such technology. It was absolutely amazing.

It was moving to the south (over and parallel to Freeway 5, perhaps?) close to the same speed and altitude as most local small aircraft traffic (I am just a few miles from PDX). It was not what most would call a spectacle. It was black, had a diamond shape with four rounded edges and had no lights, no visible features (tail, landing gear, windows) and it produced no audible sound. The sun was setting at the time and the sunlight on the bottom western edge of the object produced a warm orange glow on the surface despite being black. It left me with sense that the object had a matte rather than a high-metalic surface. My friends and I agreed that the object was not a plane or a helicopter. We considered the possibility it was a baboon. The wind was mild and steady and coming from the Northwest. The object was moving more directly to south, It follows, the winds aloft would have to have been moving in a somewhat different direction than the wind on the ground - and I realize this is very possible. I could just about cover the object with the tip of my index finger at arms length. And from this vantage point in could most certainly have been a diamond shaped balloon. However, I would think that such an odd shaped object would be more likely to tumble through the air rather than glide. Nobody was particularly impressed with the event. Nevertheless, I felt compelled to report it on the off chance that somebody else may have gotten a better look at the object and needs corroboration.",

It was pretty warm that day and it was not subsiding, so my grandmother opened up the front door so it would cool off in the house.

So I turned around in my chair and looked outside, at first I didn\u2019t see anything well, different, then I looked upward and I saw what I thought was a plane (there so frequent). Then after a few seconds I realized, it was just staying right in that one spot. I was so drawn to this object it was bizarre. The object started to move after about 30 seconds of just chilling in one spot, it shot left to right a few time at speeds I had never seen before. Then the object was doing circles and weird jolting patterns, it then stopped dead in the middle, shot back (well got smaller so I assumed it was going back from where I was.), shot down, shot back again, shot up a little ways, stayed there, then shot up and I have never seen anything like it again.

At approximately 7:30pm this evening my wife noticed in the eastern sky, above Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, two metallic appearing spherical objects.  They appeared to be connected one atop the other as they moved simultaneoulsy.  The wind was blowing the clouds quite strongly North easterly.  The object(s) remained stationary for about 5 minutes.  Around 4 people saw us staring and asked us if it was a hoax so we pointed and they stood with us for several minutes.  Whereupon the object(s) began to move in the opposite direction of the wind, but very slowly.  As we all remained focused on it, it began to move more quickly over the next couple minutes due east.  As it headed this direction, we lost sight of it in the clouds.  As soon as we lost sight of it, a jetliner came from the exact location heading NW.  This jet confirmed our object was not a plane as it was moving very quickly across the sky and appeared to be flying at the same altitude of the spherical object(s).",

About a month ago, I found a better way to present and share what I was trying to video tape that day. At the time I had submitted my report to UFOSNW.com shortly after the sighting, I only provided a snapshot image from the video because if this video is watched in normal speed , you just won't see it very well. I posted this bit of video recently on this link below, along with a LINKS to download the smaller portion of the video IN SLOW MOTION to show just the object: Please review this here: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x22tmz_odd-object-near-contrail-july-10th   As mentioned on my report to UFOSNW.com, I did not know at the time of taping this, if I was able to capture it on video - because I could not find it in the camera lens viewer. But after reviewing the MiniDV Tape, I did capture a few frames of what I saw after all! I just did not know how I could slow down the frame rate of the video for better viewing of what I was tryng to tape. When I was taping this object, I guessed and zoomed in as best as I could where I THOUGHT the object was hovering near the contrail and clouds.  I know my report is very late in coming forth to you, but because of the other report I recently found on your web site I thought maybe I should also report this to NUFORC.",

      "story": "2 very small white spheres hovered in same general area for 30 minutes On June 23rd, 2007, I ran across this report on your web site:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56872.html  I thought it sounded very similar to what I saw here in SE Portland, Oregon. I've decided to come forth about what I saw (and tried to video tape) because of this specific report. The similarities between our sightings seem very close  However, my sighting was on May 30 2007 and first seen at 19:45 to 20:15 - I observed these for around 30 minutes!  When I first saw this object, I saw only one - then later I saw two. To the naked eye it looked like a very small white sphere that did not move - sort of like a planet. But it looked very different when viewed through the binoculars. At one point while viewing it with binoculars, the center of it suddenly flashed a strange metalic gold.  I tried to video tape this object from inside my home while my camcorder was on the tripod - I could see this object in the East directly above the neighboring trees nearby around 7:45 pm. I started video taping around 7:49 pm. After a few tries (only caught a few bits of it on video), I ran outside to have a closer look at this with my 10X50 binoculars.  After observing it more closely for several minutes, getting a good look at what it was (see drawing ) I then decided to run back in the house and try to tape this again. I grab the camcorder and ran back outside and started to video tape again at 7:57 pm. Again, I was only able to get a few quick shots of this object on video. It was VERY hard to find this in the camera viewer lens of my JVC 25X optical camcorder - and its much to hard to find it on the LCD screen during daylight - and it was too small to pinpoint and focus on the object.  I continued to try off and on attempts at capturing it on video - not easy to do in clear blue skies. I had to use the trees and far distant planes with contrails to help reference about where they were above in the blue sky . The video overall is about 9 minutes (because I would pause for a bit, then try to record through out the video). These objects were observed from  around 7:45 pm to 8:15 pm. The last part of my video records a few frames of both objects at 8:15 pm just before they head up a bit higher above the one huge fir tree then they head NORTH against the 7 MPH winds that were coming FROM the WNW!. I gave up trying to record them, and ran inside to see if I could still see them.. but could not. I immediately checked the weather conditions and it confirmed to me that these were not balloons because they headed away to the NORTH against the winds that night. I also took a screen shot of the weather report at that time.  The video is not very good at all, and I cuss up a storm and at the time of recording these, I could not see them in the viewer lens, and was not sure I even caught them on the video.  After reviewing the MiniDV tape over, I did indeed catch several frames of them as I would zoom in and out where I was guessing they were in the blue sky. I used Exsate DV Capture software to be able to show the date & time embedded on the MiniDV tape. I then compiled image shots from the video in the order shown on the tape and put them together as a swf and posted them online for viewing  - Select from the drop down box 800 to see this in LARGER VIEW:  http://media.putfile.com/PDX-UFOs-May-30-2007  Note regarding some of the images: I also included various shots that shows the trees - or planes in the far background. These are what I was using as a reference point -  I would then try to zoom from those areas to where I estimated they were hovering.  My initial thought of these were balloons.  But when I went outside with my binoculars, I could see these were NOT balloons. And did not act like balloons. But even then, I thought they MIGHT be. But after trying to tape them and observing them for around 30 minutes, while they hovered above in the same general area not being affected by the wind, I realized they were probably not balloons - especially after watching them head away NORTH against the wind. Even after I looked at the weather report and the tape I really did not think it was enough to report this -- that is up until I found the report on your site and decided to come forth about what I saw.  I am just so relieved to read that SOMEONE else in Portland, Oregon saw something similar to what I saw!",

      "story": "1963 - Round hovering, soundless, rotating object over northeast Portland, Oregon I was at my cousin's house for the weekend.  She lived with her mom and sister in northeast Portland. My cousin's sister suddenly called out to us that she saw a flying saucer across the street, hovering over the park.  We, of course, didn't believe her - it was just too coincidental that we were watching Science Fiction Theatre at the same time!  Then, her mom, my aunt, said it was true, come and see it!  We flew up the stairs and went out the front door of the house.  By the time we got up stairs, the object seemed to be hovering over the \"Hollywood\" district in east Portland, about a mile south of where we were.  As it hovered, we could see a bank of greenish lights, followed by a bank of whiteish lights (about the same color as regular light bulbs).  From the rotation of the lights, we could see that the object was hovering, while turning clockwise.  After about 10 minutes, it moved to the east and then to the north, where we guessed it was near the Portland Airport.  We called the airport to find out if anyone in the tower could see it on their radar.  The answer we received was that it was a \"plane, flying a banner behind it\".  This obviously did not make sense, since it was 11:00 pm.  In addition my cousin's sister called her mother-in-law to be when she guessed it was over her mother-in-law's house and the report was that the object was \"as big as a house\", round, and didn't make any noise whatsoever.  The only sound was a \"whoosh\" as it sped by.  This has always stuck in my mind, since our technology did not extend, specifically, to soundless, round objects that could hover.

Detail of sighting: On the day of the UFO sighting, 3 friends and I where playing football in my parent\u2019s backyard, I was the first to notice the object. My friends where more interested in playing football rather then studying the anomaly which I alerted them all to \u2026 I can remember one of my friends stating after looking at the object that it must be an aircraft banking and thus no visible empennage or wings. I continued to watch more intently after the friend\u2019s suggestion and waiting for what seemed to be about 2 minuets as to view the craft turn and expose some identifiable surface. However I did not notice any change in the flight path of the object nor view any recognizable aircraft surfaces. In fact the angel of the object and its assent seemed so unusual I thought perhaps the object was a blimp, but I concluded that was not logical seeing its shape, speed, lack of identifiable markings, attitude and size. After about a total of 3-1/2 minutes I turned to my friends again to explain to them my thoughts and when I turned back the object was gone. The last point I saw the object put it in the clear of clouds and its disappearance in just an instant still amazes me even today.

      "story": "Drifting silent object estimated size of helicopter at 1000 ft with bright flamelike intermittent flashes in night sky Good Evening-  My wife and I were driving home tonight about 10:15.  We were heading south on SE 174th just north of Powell when we saw flashes in the sky.  We pulled over to see if we could see what it was and, from our vantage point looking just west of south,  it appeared that there was a helicopter hovering over Powell at about 170th and that it was firing off a strobe of some sort.   The color of the flashes looked more like fire (yellow) than like illumination and I had the impression at first that they were circular as you would see looking at a  'flashbulb'.    We watched for three or four minutes trying to hear any sound of helicopter blades.   There was not any sound. The shape of the object still appeared to be helicopter sized but there not clear running lights and the flashing didn't recur right away.   At this point,  the object appeared to be drifting in a north-northwest direction and passed overhead and just to the west of us.   Still no sound.   Occasionally there was a flash of bright light again or two but not strobelike.   I called my brother who lives almost due west of us at about 90th and asked him to go out and look as the object was getting farther away still appearing to be slowly drifting on an air current---straight line. My brother called back and was looking with his binoculars but couldn't find anything.  The object was, at that point too far to identify in the lighthaze west of me.   I looked at my clock at that point and it was 10:27 so we'd been watching for probably fifteen minutes.   A small plane on a somewhat parallel course in the opposite direction had come out of the northwest heading to the southeast about five minutes earlier and its engines were clearly identifiable. The only scenario I could envision for this event was that a hot air balloon was drifting and was having fire problems with its propane system, but the shape of the object and the inconsistency of the flashes didn't fit and the fact that it was a December night also made it unlikely.",

I saw it again tonight at about 7:12 p.m. PDT. I would estimate its altitude at about 3,000 to 5,000 feet. The speed seemed to be about that of a commercial passenger jet. The lights on this craft are non-typical. There is a blinking blue-white light at the front. Then there a bar with several lights that are slightly orange (maybe about the color of tungsten lights), just past the center of the craft, that go laterally, and look like cubes placed side by side. They shine towards the front and back of the craft. There are no lights on this craft that are typical of normal aircraft navigational lights. It appears that the craft is black with a tan colored \u201cX\u201d painted on the bottom side. The ends of the X shape are at the front and back of the craft. This craft makes no sound that I can detect.  All five times I have seen the craft it has been moving from North to South, and at different altitudes. My sighting of it have all been at night, shortly after the sun has set and it is complete dark outside.  The first time I saw this craft was in late May or early June, and I have seen it four times, about once a month, since then. The first time I saw it, I happened to look up, and it had passed right over the top of where I was standing. It was moving fairly slowly, and made no sound that I could hear. I have not been able to see the actual outline shape of the craft against the night sky, but it appears to be either flat on the bottom, or possibly slightly concave. It is many times wider than a normal airplane or jet.  In hindsight I should have recorded the times and dates of the previous sightings of this craft, or made reports on them.

      "story": "Bright sun-illuminated \"dot\" drifting over S.E. Portland, Oregon On 6 July 2007, at approximately 4:40 PM (Pacific Daylight Savings Time)in the afternoon, my wife called me on our house phone (I was upstairs, where I was working as usual at our home-based business), using her cell phone, to say that she say a UFO, and that I had better get out there (where she was: on the back deck) pretty quickly or it would probably no longer be there. I thought she was perhaps joking, as less than a minute or so previously, she had called me to ask me to take a look at the good job she had done constructing a makeshift sun-screen to protect the plants on the deck from the excessive heat and sun.  (The temperature was in the mid 80s, relatively hot for this area; the sun was quite bright). I thought her second call might be a way to get me to show up outside quicker than I might do ordinarily. When I was outside, she pointed into the bright, blue sky, where a quite bright \"dot\" was drifting slowly in the sky, very generally in an S or SE direction.  The \"dot\" appeared to maintain very generally the same apparent altitude.  Although much sunlight was apparently reflected from it, it was difficult to make out any size for the object, as if it were extremely bright but extremely far away or extremely tiny in spite of its brilliance. The object did not appear to vary noticeably in brightness during the time it was observed, which was perhaps a minute by myself, and an additional (preceding) minute by my wife.  The object showed no signed of rotation, or any sort of jerky motion that one might expect e.g. a helium-filled balloon with some sort of attached string to exhibit while being (presumably) buffeted by the wind. The air in the vicinity of our house at this time as not particularly windy, but also not necessarily totally calm. The angle of the line of sight was about 40 degrees, and certainly no more than 45 degrees; the line of sight was essentially parallel to the slope of the roof on the back (SW) portion of the second storey of our house.  The object was seen to be about one half to one inch about the slope o the roof, as estimated via fingers held out at arm's length. In discussing the sighting briefly with my wife, I referred to the object as being exceptionally shiny, although she referred to it as being very white, which I would agree with.  The color of the reflection seemed (to me) to possibly be strongly suggestive of a metallic-type reflection. Seeing the object did not result in any immediately-obvious other-worldly sensations; it seemed unusual to be seeing such an object, and there was some degree of discomfiture in not being able to classify it as to the sort of thing it was, or why it was there, or what it was doing, etc. The sky at the time was generally cloud-free, and certainly in the ESE direction toward which we were looking and where the object was seen. The object appeared to drift in the sky, until it was obscured by the upper leaves of some neighboring trees and then no longer visible. The object drifted perhaps two inches (per at-arm-length finger measurement) during the time it was observed; it was not moving particularly quickly at all.  It was most certainly not stationary, however. Attempts to contact a local (or any) FAA Flight Service Station to obtain information regarding the magnitude and direction of the winds aloft were unsuccessful, as all that was apparently readily accessible over the phone was prerecorded weather information for the vicinity, which gave just the surface winds(?), which (if I noted this correctly) were \"310\" (the heading presumably) at \"12\" (MPH?) for Portland (Oregon), or at \"6\" for Troutdale (Oregon). This report was submitted about 6:40 PM, two hours after the incident.",

      "story": "Stationary yellow-white ball of light over Portland, OR, emitting colors and no sound. I live fairly near the airport so am quite accustomed to seeing planes flying near our home as well as military jets.  Last night while on my porch just after midnight I noticed an object that was more spherical than a plane would appear and significantly larger -- I would estimate about 5 to 6 times greater in size than an airplane would be at that distance.  I watched it for about five minutes and it did not move, nor did it become larger or smaller as a plane would have had it been moving.  It was spherical, gradually changed from white to yellow (much unlike the flashing of airplane lights) and emitted and aura and lights in hues of red, yellow-orange, white and occasionally blue around its periphery.  It appeared to emit an occasional small beam of white light, though not in any discernible pattern or consistent direction.  The best way to explain the emitting colors would be to compare it to a child's sparkler on the fourth of July.  This craft/light was silent, which again is quite unlike any airplane I am accustomed to seeing, particularly on nights as quiet and still as last night was.  After approximately five minutes, possibly a bit less, the light simply went out and I was unable to see it.  There was nothing obstructing my view of it so it is impossible that its view was obscured by a tree or structure.  The sky was clear and nearly cloudless (I could see many stars) so it's not possible that it went behind a cloud, either.  I came out several more times over the next two hours, camera in hand, but it did not reappear.  Unfortunately my husband was already sleeping so did not witness it with me.  I am quite curious to see if anyone else has reported seeing similar stationary lights in Portland recently.",

I was looking out my living room window that faces East. From this window I can see a bit N, NE, E, and SE. As I turned my gaze to look in the SE direction, I saw something quite bright, large, and moving very fast suddenly appear. It came from the SW direction heading East from my window view. It was at a 35 to 45 degree angle from where I was, and flying LOWER than what the helicopters or small planes do in this area. This object moved much too fast and silent to be man-made. When it first came into my view, I thought \"Wow! A shooting star!\" But as I watched it, I realized it was too big, and too low in the sky and flying horizontally - this was not a comet or star. Also it had a defined \u201cshape\u201d to it. There were NO flames, contrails, or light streaks coming from behind this object. It had an intense yellow-white glow around the diamond shaped object. I could also see something faint and darker, in the middle of the object as shown in drawing. I did report this immediately to another web site along with a drawing of it here: http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2006/pdxor04302006/pdxor04302006.htm  I just found out from reading NUFORC's web site that others may have seen this same object as well.

I saw two strange things happen. As I was driving on 205 i looked out my driver's window and saw a bright blue ball flash across the sky, like a shooting star. The stars in the sky were like grains of sand compared to this blue ball. The ball left a white light trail as it moved. I only saw it for a second, and it vanished. i know it wasn't a shooting star because i have seen many of those, in fact one of my friends thinks i'm good luck because i see them so often. Because I was so surprised at what i saw, i called my girlfriend to tell her. she didn't believe me. i looked towards pdx airport to see if i could have possibly mistaken a plane as the blue flash of light with a white light trail. I saw a plane landing and new that it couldn't have been a plane. the blue ball that flew across the sky was WAY to fast to be a plane that we know about and it was way to close and huge to be a shooting star. the second object was totally different from the first, it was a large white sphere. I saw it when I looked towards the airport. my first reaction was \"okay now that's a plane,\" because the light was white, not blue. I looked over again and it was just hovering over near mt. tabor. I told my girlfriend on the phone about it, but she told me that i should ignore it and it isn't any of my business, which i actually thought was a weird thing for someone to say to me. i told her \"it is my business, it's in my sky.\" as i continued to drive i kept my eye as much as i could on this white ball... it began moving as i connected to 84 west. the ball moved up, and started going the same direction i was going, it would raise then get lower, then it crossed over 84 to my left side. originally it was on my right. it then flew back to the right side of the freeway and lowered as if it were headed in the direction of grant highschool. I didn't see it for a about 15 more seconds. eventuall! y it ros e up again and flew at incredible speed towards NW portland, right near montgomerey park. by now my girlfriend was getting angry with me, and kept telling me that it wasn't my business. that's when i decided i needed to get off the phone with me. she hung up mad and angry, didn't say \"i love you,\" which always means she's mad. i don't know what upset her though. well the sphere hovered over NW portland for a while and that was the last i saw of it. i had then driven out of sight of the area and the big white light. i don't what the heck went on tonight. i don't know for a fact that these were UFOs, but whatever i saw scared the crap out of me. i was sweating buckets, but my arms still had goosebumps. I am still shaken and honestly feel a little crazy. i know that this seems unbelievable, and it is. I can't even believe what i saw, but i KNOW what i saw. I was high, drunk or taking any medication. i am a college senior and to see something like this and know that if i tell anyone they will think i'm nuts, makes me feel crazy. i know it sounds crazy, but this really happened. i wish it hadn't because i can't understand it. i have no answers as to what i saw. all i know is what i saw. i am not making one part of this story up, i just wish someone else was in my car to see it. hopefully someone will report the same thing, and i won't feel so crazy. thank you for your time, and i don't know if this will help in anyway, but hopefully it does.",

First I thought it must be Jupiter or Venus, but then I saw that it was drifting slowly northward.  A big, bright light moving to the north: this could not have been a planet or a bright star.  Some might suggest that I saw an airplane; I can only say that all of the airplanes I\u2019ve seen flying at night typically have flickering lights spaced apart from one another on each wing, whereas the object last night was one solid, extremely luminous ball of light.  Others might suggest that it was a satellite, but all of the satellites I have seen in my life have not been nearly so luminous as this object.  Most importantly, neither hypothesis can explain the sudden disappearance of the object.  I have been curious about UFOs all of my life, but this was only the second time I\u2019ve ever seen anything anomalous (the first time was insignificant: probably just a balloon).  For a while I stared out my window, hoping it would come back again.  But (alas!) it was gone.  I only saw it for about 10 seconds before it vanished.  Perhaps someone else in the Portland area saw it, too.  I want to go to McMinnville this weekend to hear you speak, but I don\u2019t have any way to get there.  Greyhound doesn\u2019t go out there on weekends.  Perhaps next time.  That is all.  Thank you for your time and the fine work you do.",

While travelling home from grocery shopping with my girlfriend, I happened to look up into the partly-cloudy sky as something caught my eye.  At first, I thought it was the moon, showing through the clouds, but as you know, when driving, the moon doesn't appear to 'move' noticeably unless you turn your car or the like. It was then that I looked more closely and saw what appeared to be a tight cluster of objects.  It was dark and while they did not appear to be glowing, they were ever so much lighter than the sky or clouds behind them.  My girlfriend was driving so I asked her to stop the car.  We pulled over and got out of the vehicle. She was the first one to see the second cluster. This second grouping was not so 'tight-knit' as the first. I was easy to dismiss the whole event as escaped balloons at first....especially with the first group being so close together. But, with their altitude, it was plain to see these two clusters were much too far apart to be simultaneous balloon releases. We noticed that we could make out individual 'units' in the second cluster which moved almost like fish in the water. There appeared to be 30 or more in this cluster alone. Not pushed about on the wind like floating balloons, and certainly not with the flapping motion of a bird, the movement of each unit was fluid with definite acceleration by some to keep the group together. Birds such as geese, flying in a V formation, do not circle for a better position within their group, as we witnessed that night. I've never believed in aliens, flying saucers or the like, but I was hoping someone has more information on what these objects could more logically be. I think I'd rather live with good confirmation that we are alone in the universe.",

Monday, Memorial Day - May 28, 2007, Portland, OR, USA At about/between 18:30 to 19:00 PST, I looked up into the bright clear sunny sky, above the waxing daylit moon (full on 5/31/07) and saw what appeared to be stars or planets in the S/SE, but I knew they couldn't be stars or planets - invisible in daylit sky.  The sun was still at least an hour or so from setting.  I thought they might be satellites, but they were not moving in the fast, straight orbit pattern of satellites.  They were fairly bright (white light, like metal reflecting sun), and I realized they must be craft of some sort in the high earth atmosphere realm, either going out to space or returning.  Definitely not airplanes, they appeared to be flying above aircraft altitude and were not blinking or moving in the straight pattern as airplanes.  They were circular in shape and exactly the size of stars/planets to my relative view.  They were about 20 degrees up from the horizon in the S/SE section of sky over SE Portland.  There were six to seven of them covering about a 10 - 15 degree area across the sky in roughly the same plane/area across the sky just above and to the right of the moon, but they were not moving in formation nor were they evenly spaced.  The three on the left side were in a triangular/Cassiopeia-like space and formation, and the others to the right were in more horizontal formation, but not exactly a straight line.  They all moved as if they were flying, but slow, not like a plane.  It was regular/straight-ish movement, as human/craft (plane, car, ship, people) would move.  It didn't in any way seem alien or weird.  They simply looked like six human craft.  They remained in roughly the same area in the sky, although they were moving a little bit in relation to each other, like if you're watching 7 people or animals in a group walking or hanging out.  When I first had looked up, I saw three bright ones and then the few fainter ones to the right became brighter.  A seventh moved in from faint to bright into the same realm and then back faint again.  They were visible in the sky for about 10 or 20 or more minutes, and then gradually they all became fainter and fainter and disappeared into the sky as they came, like craft flying out to space from the earth atmosphere.  My friend returned but only as they were disappearing - he saw 2 or three of them.",

I then though that it was maybe just a plane, since the flight pattern goes that way, but the light wasn't moving. Slowly I noticed it move. It took about three minutes for it to slowly move behind the left apartment building. I then decided to walk up a floor or two, to see if I could see it since it hid high up on the building. I caught a glimpse of it again, and yet again it hid. I did this a couple more times and it kept hiding. It . Finally, It dissapeared or went behind the  building and I wasn't able to catch a glimpse of it anymore. I ran and grabbed two of my friends. I returned with them, about two minutes after losing sight, and there it was back where it originally was not even  moving. My friends and I sat and watched it for about two minutes. It sat there motionless for about a minute. Then slowly started moving and gaining little speed as it traveled to the left again. It then began to dim. It dimmed completely before being blocked by the building. I had this sort of weird feeling that what ever it was knew it was being watched, so it kept hiding. I think bringing the two other friends convinced it to vanish. The apartment buildings are about a half a mile from my dorm, so we decided to walk over there, but saw nothing.  While the bright light was going on, I also noticed a pulsating red light flying in a circle over and over to the right of the it, but didn't think too much about it.  While walking back from checking out the apartment area, I spotted a red lighted craft, maybe a plane or satelight flying above. Whatever it was it was fast, and high in the air. It made a total pass of the sky within 2-3 minutes or so. Later on the night, me and one of the other witnesses spotted one of the pulsating red lights where the bright white light was. it was fling in irregular patterns. sharply left and right and up and down.

The friend & I were sitting facing east to northeast & I witnessed a large triangular shaped object with three orbs located in each of the corners silently fly across the sky, traveling in a south to north direction. The object appeared to have a soft orange glow about its perimeter as well as around the orbs.  The event only took about 5-8 seconds to occur & what we found most stunning was the fact that it was absolutely silent as it traveled. We live somewhat near the airport & hear a lot of air traffic. This object however was perfectly silent & given the late hour, there wasn\u2019t a lot of ambient noise in the neighborhood.  In the time it took the two of us who witnessed the event to simultaneously say, \u201cwhat was that!?!?\u201d the object disappeared behind a large tree in our yard & was gone. Needless to say, it rattled both of us & we proceeded to describe it to my husband. Our descriptions were identical. We then went inside the house where we both independently drew what we saw. The pictures are eerily similar (drawings submitted separately).

I kept following it with my eyes and eventually it got to the point where it was behind a tree and some buildings I couldn't get past.  At that point I was not sure and I thought it could be a weather balloon because it got slightly higher as I was looking at it.  So, I continued to walk my dog.  When I was heading back into the direction of my house I was able to confirm that it was a UFO because it was lower this time and I could see it clearly.   I followed it for a while with my eyes then eventually it moved across the sky and got higher and higher going in different direction that it disappeared.   It appeared as if it was doing some sort of observation operation by the way it behaved. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "Two cops observed four strange lights over Portland, OR and one of the lights appeared to \"drip\" a molten substance. I was working as a police officer for the City of Portland, OR on March 30, 2009. PPB officers usually ride alone in patrol cars but it was the week of Spring Break and night-shift officers, like myself, were asked to pair up to enforce city curfew ordinances that night. At approximately 21:10 hours, my partner and I were dispatched to cover another officer who was responding to the report of a domestic disturbance. The problem address was located either three or four houses north from the intersection of N Moore Ave/N Jarrett St. Portland, OR 97217 (Latitude: 45.565156, Longitude: -122.667971). After we were done assisting the primary officer on that call (~23:30), we remained outside our cars to discuss the night\u2019s events to that point. As we were talking, I glanced to the southwest and noticed two gleaming lights, flying in formation, moving in an east-southeasterly direction. I pointed out the lights to my partner and we walked south 15 or so yards to the NW corner of the intersection. We stood there and continued to watch the lights. The two lights were visible against thick, high clouds. It was not raining, there was no noticeable wind, and no stars were visible. The lights were a pale streetlight-amber, the lights shown steadily, and about were approximately three to four times the diameter of the brightest/largest star I have ever seen in the night sky. The height of the clouds helped me estimate the sources of the lights were no larger than a small shuttle bus. There were no aircraft navigation strobes or safety beacons visible on or near the two light sources. My partner and I both commented we could not hear any sound coming from the lights. The two objects were moving at a speed I judged to be slower than a typical propeller aircraft could travel. We assumed if the light sources were helicopters we were close enough to hear the blades of their rotors and see additional lights on the aircraft. Aircraft was audible in the distance to the northeast. Portland International Airport is only a few miles from that area. However, it struck me as odd that the lights were flying eastbound since almost all air traffic approaches the airport from the south or east. My partner is a captain in the Army National Guard and is familiar with military aircraft. He had no idea what we were watching. The two lights were flying in a loose formation, at the same altitude but one slightly ahead of the other. The northernmost light was leading. The lights\u2019 relative proximity to one another was also out of the ordinary. I estimated the source of each light was approximately 25\u2019 in diameter. With those dimensions, I would guess the distance between the two lights was 150-250 yards. It is very unusual to see aircraft flying that near to one another over the city. The lights began to turn toward the south in a lazy arc. The leading light took a wider turn than the other. As they did so, we were surprised to see another pair of lights following the first pair. The second pair of lights was at the same altitude, moving at the same speed, and flying in the same general formation as the first pair. The distance between the two pairs of lights was hard to estimate but I would guess there was a half-mile or so between the two pairs of lights. My partner had received orders he was deploying to Iraq in a few weeks and had bought a video camera in preparation for his departure. He had brought the camcorder to work that night, and he ran back to our patrol car to retrieve it. He returned and began filming the lights as the first two lights began to disappear out of view behind some tall trees. The second pair of lights followed the same course and began to make the same turn to the south when something odd began to happen. The southern light of the second pair slowed noticeably and began to flicker. The random tempo and change in luminosity of the flickering reminded me of a lit candle in a slight breeze. The flickering had been going on for about eight seconds or so when we both saw something begin to \u201cdrip,\u201d multiple times, from the bottom of the object. The molten substance was the same color as the light and it dimmed then sputtered out as it fell from its source. The speed at which the incandescent substance fell from light indicated to me it had significant mass. For example, a drip fell at a greater rate than that of a fizzling firework ember. My eyes traveled downward in-line with some of the drips. I saw the material reignite briefly although it was significantly dimmer. Overall, I estimated it would have taken the material ten seconds to fall to the ground. That intuitive estimate of altitude helped me get a bearing on how far away the lights were from us. I suppose the nearest light passed within 15-25 blocks south of our location. My partner stated military aircraft are forbidden to drop flares over populated areas in order to prevent fires. No unexplainable fires were reported in that neighborhood that evening. The flickering light eventually stabilized and began glowing steadily again as it continued moving to the south-southeast. I estimate we watched the lights for the better part of two minutes. The non-flickering lights did not move toward or away from the flickering light.  That led me to think the flicking light was not in distress. I did not get the opportunity to view the footage my partner filmed. He promised me he would get me a copy of the raw video but failed to do so before being shipped out to the Middle East. I imagine it looks like all the other night UFO videos in that it depicts a strange light with a black background. I do not know if he caught the flickering and dripping on video. I have never seen anything else in my life that I would call a UFO.  My partner and I discussed what we had seen for the rest of the evening and were unable to come up with a plausible explanation for what we had witnessed.",

At first I saw nothing but a high altitude plane, at about 35,000 ft. but then to my surprise I saw something else too. Beyond the plane, higher up, maybe at 60,000 ft. I saw something strange. I put down the lens and looked again with the naked eye, nothing. Again, I looked through the binocs and once again saw the \"thing\" in the bright day sky. It looked like a gold cylinder with reddish top and bottom. My brain could not quite place the object, I was searching for a connection to something else I may have seen before but could not quite understand what it was that I was looking at.The only connection I could fathom was that I looked kind of like a plane rising up into the sky at first, then, it also had characteristics of a kite, but it was tumbling, head over head, in one place. I was confused and amazed, I really could not place this thing...I could not understand in my mind what this was....strange. My friend then told of how he had been seeing these things all week and followed them with the binocs as they moved, often randomly, his girlfriend also witnessed them from time to time yet she never spoke of it and even joked around about her \"crazy\" boyfriend always looking up. I am not saying there where little green men in these objects but to this day I can not explain or identify this object with any one thing I have ever seen before.

I flipped over to lay on my back and put my hand up to the sky to cover the sun when I noticed a small, bright silver flying object going across the sun at a pretty quick pace too fast for any airplane).  I thought it could be anything as it went very quickly out of sight.  I kept my hand up to see if I'd see it again and for the next half hour or so I continued to see these, all staying very close to the sun, not seeing more than three at a time.  I called my boyfriend to go outside and see if he saw any and he did.  He called his father who liveds in Tualatin to go outside, and he saw them too.  They never stopped flying around the sun but we went inside because the sun eventually hurt our eyes.  We would have taken pictures, but it wouldn't work because the sun was too bright.",

After it was almost out of my line of sight it seemed to start behaving strangely and moving up and down.

I thought this could be a satellite but given its erratic behavior i do not believe this.   This is the first time i have ever seen a UFO but my mother saw one in 1972.

We also saw a helicopter that seemed to be pretty close to the light at the triangal tip.  The helicopter left and shortly after we saw an airplane. the third light became invisible to us but the two stayed in exact formation but seemed to be traveling southbound.  When we arrived to our destination, (Oregon City) the two lights were still in what appeared to be exact distance from each other as when we first saw them.  They seemed to be stationary again for some time.  I went outside to look at them a few times for the next fifteen minutes and the last time I checked they appeared to be on the move again but still in formation. What is interesting is that there were other people on the freeway who had to see them.  The helicopter and plane certainly did but no report on news or in the morning paper.  Even if they were blimps or something explainable, it would seem that lots of people would have called in.

      "story": "On the morning of Wednesday April 28, I was staying at a friend's house in SW portland and we had been up all night having a conversation.  We were standing in his kitchen looking out the sliding glass door to the upper balcony.  His deck looks east over the Willamette, and his house sits very high up, near John's Landing and Macadam.  Because his house sits at the top of the viewpoint it offers a full view of Ross Island and directly parallel from the deck is the north end of Oaks Bottom Natural Reservation.  This is where the whole incident took place it did not happen in the sky. The objects appeared about a half mile away from us, from the opposite bank, the east side, of the river. Before we noticed the lights, we were having a good conversation talking about the state of the world, spirituality, and sharing personal experiences.  I had gotten to the subject of recent UFO sighting I've had, and I was explaining to him that I really feel that we can be making efforts to reach out and contact off world visitors, as individuals, and as communities or small groups.  I was telling him about a sighting I had near Lake Cushman in Washington, where I was staying at a friends cabin.  This particular sighting happened one night a few months prior, when I went out to the deck of the cabin overlooking the lake.  Strangely enough, when I went out there the sky was clear but nothing unusual was visible.  I closed my eyes and began to envision a light rising up out of the lake, and I put out my thoughts that I wish to have a contact and I want to see something, then when I opened my eyes out in the distance on one of the hills was a white light which had appeared while my! eyes were closed! It pulsed irregularly with no apparent pattern, and the brightness of the pulses also were changing.  This is a sighting in Washington months ago so I won't go into detail here.  But it's important to describe this because it is interconnected with all of my sightings I've had recently, which all seem to be the same 'type of craft'. SO, while I was describing this to my friend, I had been looking out his window at lights which were flashing and changing colors, but I hadn't noticed consciously.  My friend interrupted me from my descriptions and said, \"What are those lights out there?\"  I then noticed we were looking at something unusual.  I started to list things off and I thought at first we were looking at a traffic intersection, was there an accident?  Were we looking at ambulance lights or was there construction going on out there?  But my friend pointed out the lights were not coming from our side of the river, they weren't that close.  These lights were coming from across the river!  We went out to the balcony and our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was just before sun rise so it was pretty dark out.  We could clearly see the outline of the river and Ross Island, and the tree line and bank of the east side where Oaks Bottom sits. The lights were all very close together, I would say there was an area of 100-200 feet which these lights stuck together and hovered around very close to ground level.  The lights didn't rise up above the tree line so they stayed about 50-100 feet above the ground and the river.  They moved slightly at first from side to side, and then towards the end of the sighting they did move north about a quarter mile before disappearing right before our eyes. To describe the lights without seeing them for yourself does not give justice to the intensity of what we saw! I could not stop saying, \"This is so beautiful! Have you ever seen something so amazing and beautiful before!\"  I was touched by the sheer sight of it all.  But also I was going through phases of many emotions and physical feelings during this sighting.  At first I was skeptical, uncertain of the area we were viewing, that it could be something unexplainable.  But as it got brighter out I could see my friend was right, it was an area where there are no buildings, no roads, and no public access.  The lights we saw are unlike anything I've really seen before.  Even in science fiction movies, these lights just were so unique I can't really describe it perfectly. There were lots of colors, and the lights seemed to change rapidly in shape, size, color, and brightness. The lights would stay 'lit' for a split-second to a full few seconds.  And the lights were not lights on an object - this is very important to understand - the UFO was a group of lights with no other objects associated.  I could clearly see, for the entire duration, the larger lights would pulsate, glow, and vibrate for a few seconds.  Then, upon shrinking and disappearing, it would be followed by dozens of colorful sparkles and twinkles and yet more bright white-blue or golden pulses.  The number of individual pulses and appearances would number in the hundreds.  Because for the whole duration these twinkling pulsating orbs of light would be constantly changing and it was hard to say whether we were observing a collective of dozens of individual objects, or if this was some kind of vortex which many objects were popping in and out of, or if maybe it was all one big transparent object which dozens of changing lights appearing all over it. We were out there for a while and continued to watch these lights with much excitement and wonder, for the next 20-30 minutes I assume.  The sun came up not long after we stepped outside, and the lights continued pulsing even though it was then light out and we could clearly see no vehicles, people, objects, or anything at all! The lights were appearing from out of nowhere, they were literally phasing into our visual perception either from another dimension, or from a band of light or vibration which we cannot visually see - or both. I recall my friend describing that he felt very warm through the entire experience, I too did feel like I was having hot-flashes, but I at the peak of the experience, I felt as if electricity was surging through my body, and I felt like I was having a transmission of thought with these objects. So many feelings went through me. But not one tiny amount of fear was felt - I felt completely secure and in fact I felt very blissful and loving energy. I recall that there were tears streaming down my cheeks and I couldn't help but cry because the love and joy I was feeling was SO intense!  I felt that these lights were supporting us, all of humanity, and they care dearly for our well-being and our planet too. We are not alone and we live in a vast universe. But we do not have anything to fear, if we feel fear and are in a negative place within, then we are going to attract such experiences perhaps unconsciously. We must remain grounded, centered, and composed. We didn't get any pictures or footage at all unfortunately, but this sighting was more than a usual UFO sighting, to me it was a CE5 - a close encounter of the fifth kind characterized by close bilateral communication, and experiencing physical effects from the encounter. I can send a picture of where the sighting took place using an aerial of the area from google maps - if this is something that would be useful then let me know. I can be contacted via phone or e-mail for further questions and details.  I am an artist so I have been drawing what I saw but truly the whole incident was so dynamic a simple picture doesn't really show the incredible animation of these objects. I am personally making efforts to pursue more contacts and I feel very confident now that things are just beginning and I am very excited for the near future events to come.  I know I have my own personal perception of what happened and because i've experienced 'supernatural' or unusual events all my life, I am very confident in trusting my intuition on these matters.  Contact with these higher dimensional beings requires an open heart, and pure intent.  We must be raising our vibration as individuals, communities, and a planet - there is much hope for us here in our quest to heal and clean our home, these beings are here for multiple reasons, some may be a part of our earth too, some may be here to assist us or our planets or the sun. We will find out more as we open up and begin to shift into the new paradigm. There is much more I could attribute to this sighting, as in the last 2 weeks I've had yet another sighting but of a smaller implication. I've seen ufos in the sky but my sightings are happening on ground level as well simultaneously in some cases. I am pursuing more contacts with an open heart and mind. Thought and meditation techniques are very helpful and I believe the way to go for pursuing a communication with dimensional beings. Please contact me if you feel compelled to, I feel there is much more to come very soon!",

I have been married for a little over 10 years to my second husband and a little over 8 years to my first husband. I graduated high school in the top 10% of my class. Over my lifetime I have spent a lot, or more than average amount, of time looking at the stars at night because they have always fascinated me. What I have observed I started noticing about two weeks ago but I cannot tell you when the events actually started. While going outside at night to smoke, I ovserved some bright lights in the sky. These lights were brighter than any I have ever seen. They were also closer to the ground than any I have ever seen. Upon seeing the first one, I scanned the sky and I noticed that there were more and they were all doing the same things. I guess what caught my attention more than anything was the pattern that they were moving in the sky and that they strobed a light which at first glance reminded me of a plane in the night sky. So, because some of them were so close to the ground and moving erraticly and flashing funny, I started watching them. I then observed that these lights were not and could not be planes. They seemed to be moving back and forth and up and down and sometimes in a circle pattern and flashing a red, blue, white, and green lights. They were fast moving as well. Faster than anything I have ever seen. After about a week of seeing them I mentioned the matter to my husband. Later that day I mentioned it to my 15 yr old son. That same night, I went outside about 1am to smoke and my son was still up. I can inside and got him. He came outside with me and I pointed the lights out to him and he sat outside for more than 2 hrs watching them with me. He observed the same things I noticed. I had him tell me the specifics about their movements before I told him what I was seeing in detail because I wanted to know that I was actually seeing what I was seeing. He also noticed the exact movements and flashes of light that I was and he also observed that they could not be planed due to the fact that they were moving too fast and not in patterns that a plane makes or even could make. I laughed at first because I thought I was dreaming or just was not seeing what I thought I was seeing. I could draw a picture of the shape of the objects but typing or trying to put it into words just doesnt do them justice. They are beautiful and seem to change shape. They are in different areas of the night sky and seem to be operating in pairs. For everyone I see I will see another one close by making the same erratic movements with the same flashes of light. And sometimes they just disappear and reappear in the same spot in which they vanished. That about sums it up. I could keep typing but I would just seem to be repeating myself, so I will stop. I would like to know what these strange lights are. They have me worried about what is going on and at the same time fascinated as to what may be going on. I know what I see and I know that it is different from anything I have ever seen before.",

Under a clear, cloudless sky I observed a point of orange-ish light traveling south to north almost directly overhead Portland, Oregon.  My eyes would not otherwise have been distracted to peer skyward had it not been for a \"flaring\" effect I noticed from this object moving from the south.  I compare this object to a star of magnitude +2 and when it didn't flare it appeared identical to a star. The best approximation I can describe this \"flaring\" is to equate it with the firing of air in a hot air balloon at high altitude.  The flaring had colors of red/orange/white and would last about ten seconds, then cease and the point of light would reappear.  The flaring occurred in intervals of about two to three minutes and I observed about five of these events.  The object continued to move south to north at a steady rate but abruptly began traveling northeast as it passed over the Vancouver, WA area.  I continued observing this object for 20 minutes and the flaring continued to occur at regular intervals throughout the period of my observation.",

      "story": "A football sized glowing orange saucer shaped object , hovering completely still over head, disappears into the horizon in a flash. To Whom This May Concern:  This sighting happened a very long time ago so you may not be interested in hearing about it now, though you weren\u2019t created yet when it occurred. I have never reported it and for years have wondered if I should to add support to those sightings I read about. The year was somewhere around 1965-67 and I was sleeping outside on my parents deck in southwest Portland, Oregon with a friend. It was summertime and we were in our sleeping bags on lounge chairs watching the stars and chit chatting. . . All of a sudden a star, or what we thought was a star fell out of the Big Dipper. . .like from one of the corners and straight down. We both commented on the falling star and kept viewing the sky as before. Soon after we noticed a light that was moving in our direction, yet still out in the distance quite a ways, so we began watching it to see what it was or where it was going. My parents lived in an old established neighborhood which had lots of trees here and there, so as this light moved sort of back and forth horizontally across our field of vision, it would be blocked for short periods due to the trees blocking our view. Eventually, say within 3-4 minutes, this light flew around to the right of us behind a group of trees and when it came out into view and flew toward us, it stopped directly over head for about a minute. . . .This was a complete stop. It hovered over head at an angle and was no longer just a light, it now appeared to be a saucer shaped object, about a foot in length, and glowing like a coal out of a fire (the whole thing). After sitting there at a complete stop over our heads, it shot towards the distant horizon in a flash, within the snap of my fingers. Another interesting thing about this is later, much later, in about 2005, I met a young woman in a class down in Eugene, Oregon who had lived next door to my parents long after I had moved out, and she told me that she had also seen a UFO while living in that house next door, (not the same incident), as this young woman is much younger than I, and then she told me that the neighbors on the other side of my parents house had years before also seen a UFO and I guess had reported it anonymously to have their name left off of the report. I find that really interesting and makes me wonder about that particular area, and why would three completely separate occurrences of UFO sightings be had there (?)

At an elevation angle of perhaps 15 or 20 degrees.   It moved rather slowly, taking 8 or 10 seconds to travel from left to right across my range of vision.  It left no streak or trail behind. So it didn't seem like a meteor, traveling too slowly and too horizontally; also, I could discern a diameter to its circular shape -- about the width of a matchstick held at arm's length.   It made no sound, so I'm sure it was no airplane. My location was in southeast Portland, Clackamas County, immediately west of I-205 on S.E.

It did not seem too far away, traveled in a straight path, did not have any sort of tail, and wasn\u2019t really fire as much as glowing and omitting light from all directions.  Its movement was more floating than flying and was very fluid.  You could not see a definitive shape to the object and it was definitely not a plane.   As it got farther away it appeared to slow down or possibly stopped, but that could have just been the depth of field playing tricks on my eyes.

I was taking pictures when my girlfriend got my attention... at first she thought she saw a police car, but the red and blue lights didn't flash.  Once the object floated way above any bridge in downtown she knew it was no car.  Thats when she called for me.  I looked at where she was pointing, and instantly knew it was something I had never seen before!  So I pointed my camera and pressed record, but my camera was still set on photo.  So I snapped a quick blurred picture of it before I switched it to video.  I think I got some good footage of the orb floating up, down, and all around until it flickers away into nothing. I still have the raw footage on my camera as evidence to it not being altered with special effects.  I have a simple little digital camera, which would be impossible to add special effects to video on it. The light seemed to be solid blue on one side and solid red on the other.  You can see this as the object moves from side to side.  During the filming I was so excited, I wanted more footage! I am going back tonight 08/16/2010 hoping to see it again.

It was after dusk and my mom was showing me one of the planets that were really bright in the sky. She had gone back inside and after a while I happened to look up and noticed a large triangular object overhead. We were at my aunts apartment and this helped me with gage the size of it.  The length of the craft was 2.5 to 3 times the length of her apartment building and the width was about 1.5 the length of the building.  I hovered, making no noise, about 3 telephone pole lengths above the height of a telephone pole. There were lights on the underside and sides visible that I have not seen since.  I remember looking up at it and then looking down to street level, ( I was in back patio area) and looking to the street only 20ft away, I saw a woman walking west.  All she had to do was look up and she would have saw it.  I went back insi! de and told my mom \"I need to show you something.\" she came out and I asked her to look up.  She looked up a little and said \"What?\" I told her to look up higher  a couple times and she looked up and saw it. I remember the look of her mouth dropping open and me asking her \"what is it?\"  She said she didn't know.  We watched it and it did move ever so slowly still no sound. It was still there but she decided to go to the phone booth and called the news stations and although they said there had been thousand of calls they could give no info and directed her to call the national guard.  She talked to someone and told them what we saw but they would give no information on  what it was but did ask what our names, ages, location of sighting, and social security numbers. We returned back to the apartment and talked to my aunts room mate and I remember her turning pale, not talking, and leaving. Later she told of following seeing several in the 82nd and Division area.  Forgive me for bei! ng long winded I just wish I knew what it was. I have searched! for loc al articles but have yet to see anything resembling what I saw.  Even other triangle pictures do not look like what i observed.  Can you help?",

      "story": "Huge UFO passing between opening over the city of Portland, Oregon Coming down OHSU Hospital in Portland, Oregon which is on a hill above the city.  It was winter and the sky was clouded and grey, but there was like an opening between the clouds and below it you could see the city lights.  It was about 8 PM on a Sunday night.  As I was going down the hill, looking at the city, suddenly a huge, immense, flying object started passing almost in front of me, and on top of the city.  I stop the car in the middle of the road as I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was flying low, so low I could see how huge it was.  Unbelievable... it was almost at the bottom of the heavy clouds passing the opening in the sky.  I could see it passing, like in slow motion, like almost hoovering, without making any noise, nothing.  It was in a tilt position, like a dish, a plate... Huge, immense,like a football field,looked round but it was so big it could have been oval because the border of the tilt make me feel it was round or oval, looked heavy, the color was clear grey metalic but it was not shiny, on the tilted side I could see, there where four roads of blinking lights, like the christmas lights. I didn't see the top because it was tilted, only the bottom and the lights around the side. After being in my car looking at this scenario, I decided to walk outside the vehicle, to see if someone else was seeing it. But when I stepped out and looked at the sky, the flying object had dissapeared. I returned to the hospital as I was so impressed... I told my story to the ER doctors I work with and everyone believe me.  I was told they see things like that all the time.  For me was the first and the last.  I called the Air Force, the TV stations, the airport, but no one give me any attention.  I do believe that I saw a UFO, I think I was fortunate to see something like that in my life.  It was too wide and too long, and absolutely quiet to be anything I have ever seen.  It was not an airplane or a flying globe.  This was a huge, immense object, so big, it couldn't be confused with any known thing.  May be a mother ship? I will never forget this experience, I could take a test to verify my story.",

      "story": "t-shaped,y-shaped,triangle,three lights,daytime While driving to work today, I saw a UFO. I still can't believe it. Around 9AM, I was headed SE on Highway 30. I was running late for work due to sleeping in and my having to stop to get gas. Before I reached the Sauvie Island bridge, I saw what looked like a plane in the sky -- white, glimmering, about the right size.  This may sound unusual, but since I was a kid I've looked at planes and always waited to see their wings. This time, however, it remained sort of roundish and slowly turning, since the light reflection looked like it was changing. So I started to wonder if it was a helicopter but very high up. As it turned, it slowly got darker -- and suddenly it was gone. Since I was driving, I really couldn't scan the sky much to find it. I kind of smiled to myself that it was sort of like a UFO sighting. As I got closer to Linnton, however, I saw the thing again! The experience was the same only it took place over about 10 seconds instead of 30 or so. Again, it started out glimmering, then \"turns\", goes dark, and was gone. At this point, I was curious. Did I just lose track of it before? Because I was driving slow this time, I was able to search the sky a bit. Nothing. I got my first stop of the trip at the Kittridge intersection. I look up again and I see the darn thing a third time! This time I had a better chance to watch it while the streetlight was red. There were clearly three lights and a Y- or T-shaped frame that looked like a gray plane without its nose. The lights made me think of the classic \"triangle UFO\" for a moment, which I thought was pretty weird. All of a sudden, the lights on it go out one by one. At first, it seemed like it had disappeared again. But I squinted and I realized that I could see it flying away SE -- a little more East than I'm facing. It was fading away into the sky's haze and moving very fast. I'd say fast like a jet, but the horizon haze gave me the impression it was higher and faster than jets I've watched. I eventually lost sight of it in the distance. The light turned green and I didn't see it again. I hadn't thought to take out my iPhone to snap a picture. Each time I saw it, it was a surprise. And obviously I couldn't take a photo while driving. Nonetheless, I saw it clearly and my head is spinning a little bit thinking about what it was!",

We watched as the red lights climbed in the sky, and soon a fourth appeared.  The first red light in line suddenly flickered and disappeared into the sky, followed soon thereafter by the second, third, and fourth.

      "story": "Was up late Wednesday night, early Thursday morning, and went out to the alley behind my apartment in Northwest Portland (Around NW 23rd Ave) for a cigarette before bed when I noticed two lights in the sky. One orange-ish red, the other blue-ish green. There was no other light so I couldn't make out a shape but these lights were not separate entities they were definitely both apart of the same object. At first I shrugged it off as an aircraft, turned the other way and finished my cigarette. 2 or 3 minutes later when I turned to go back inside I looked back to the North and the aircraft was still in the same location. I stood and observed it for another 2 or 3 minutes and watched as it seemed to hover in place. My next instinct told me because of the size of the lights, much larger and brighter than any of the closest stars, that it was at a lower altitude, and because of this and the fact it was hovering I assumed it might be a helicopter. However there was no audible engine noise which would be impossible for an Aircraft this size at this altitude. Unless of course I have serious hearing impairment which I do not. Another remarkable thing about this object was that the lights were near perfect spheres, no blurring, blinking, or flashing. Just nearly perfect luminescent spheres. Also the Orangeish and Greenish lights were the only lights I observed. No blinking lights on the belly or tail like you'd come to expect from a commercial or passenger Aircraft. Lastly the position of the object would've placed it between Forest Park and downtown Portland, in my opinion a precarious, and somewhat suspicious position for any conventional aircraft to be flying, especially considering it's somewhat low estimated attitude. To end, I'd like to add that I worked nearly 2 years as ground crew at Portland International Airport. During my time there I've worked on all types of aircraft from small commuter planes to Airbus 330's. I'd like to think of myself as fairly knowledgeable when it comes to identifying the various Aircraft the fly in and out of PDX. However I could not identify this as a conventional aircraft.",

On Friday, September 9th, at approx 8:00 pm, my seven year old son and I were driving back to Portland,Oregon from Vancouver,Wa. When we were coming off I5 on to the 405 he said \"Dad what are those?\". I looked over downtown and there were seven objects, fairly large.  There was another off in the distance, much larger over the hill. I told him they were probably planes or helicopters. He then said \"look there is another down by the river\".  I looked down towards the St Johns bridge and there was one down there as well.  They all had a light in the middle and a blue and white light rotating around the circumference. I say circumference because we drove right under one on the 405 and it was approx 500 to 1000 feet up.  It was round, and large.  Other people were looking because I looked at the car next to us and they were looking up also. My son said \"Dad we need to call Rxxx Lxxxxxxx and Gxxxxx Nxxxx.\" LOL Any way, we came home and told my wife and then I started to look on YouTube to see if anyone saw what we did, there was one video a few hours later.  I continued to look on YouTube every few days.  Just the other day I found a new video on YouTube and I think it is what we saw. The video is apparently older, but it is taken from he St Johns bridge and looks very similar to what we saw. The video was taken during the day, we saw ours right at dusk. But they are similar. Any how, just thought you might be interested.",

This was east.  It rose up and hovered for a few seconds then it started heading away from me up and towards the southeast.  There was no sound.  I could not tell if it was spinning or rotating but it was shimmering.",

      "story": "Orange orbs seemingly attached to triangular object witnessed in Portland Oregon 10/18/2011 The objects were a distance, at least 2 miles, away in the sky. What was noticeable were three large orange orbs of light in a triangle formation, the orbs seemed to be connected to a much larger object that could have been about .25 to .5 miles long.  It seemed that these orang orbs were connected to a much larger object due to the way they maneuvered. It appeared that the large triangular object was hovering and rotating in the same location, and then very slowly moved behind a tall building, which was in the line of sight of the witness, and disappeared.  While this occurred both an airplane and a helicopter flew by, both being much closer than the object, and each orb was significantly larger than either the airplane or helicopter. The observer is a recent college graduate, with a degree in psychology (which trains people in proper observation and recording techniques).  Observer also is not 100% sure this was an extraterrestrial vehicle, however believes it very well could have been one.  Observer also managed to obtain both photographs and video footage of the object.",

      "story": "I believe it was July 6 of 2011.  I had just gotten off of work.  I was driving down W Burnside Rd, in the west hills, facing NE, going around what I believe is Washington park.  As I was going around a curve, there was a very tall tree in front of me, on the hill that the curve goes around, I saw a very large object going behind the tree.  It was directly in front of me.  I believe the reason it cough my eye was because it was so so so shiny it looked to me as if a piece of tin foul with the most bright light shining off of it.  The shine was most bright in the middle of the object and faded as it got closer to the sides of the object where you could see medal it looked like tin foil.  This object was about 6 or 7 times the size of when you look at the sun.  It was only maybe 500 or so feet directly in front of me. It took up about 2 or 3 of the limbs on the tree.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  I do not remember the shape but I know it was a solid shape like a circ! le or octagon or some kind of shape like that.  There was nothing hanging off the object like wings of propellers.  This whole time I was on the phone with a friend (she is planning on making a report of what happened on her side of the line.)  But I thought I had only seen it for a glimpse of a second.  But my friend told me I stopped talking for over a minute.   When I came to the other side of the curve there was a few trees, but the object was no longer there.  I think the weirdest part is that there was NO noise at all.  I do remember as soon as I saw the object I was so infatuated with it.  It happened so fast but just remember being amazed not even thinking about if it was a plane or not but just wanting to see it.  I don\u2019t remember any of the time from seeing the object, until my friend had been yelling in my ear, \"Hello?\"",

Three of us were packing our car for a camping trip in SE Portland and we witnessed a neon blueish bright white light hovering in the sky to the north anywhere from 5 to 15 miles.       It moved to the left very quickly, continued hovering at the same altitude.  Then very quickly moved to the right. It continued back and forth in an almost pendulum manor.  It descended towards the horizon to where we almost couldn't see it through the trees in our back yard.  I could still see it though, hovering and moving large distances back and forth until it jumped back up in the sky and hovered some more.  It continued to move back and forth, up and down until it eventually decended at a sideways steady speed and disappeared from our view.  Our 3 neighbors heard us yelling and came outside and saw it all happening as well.  We caught a small glimpse of video.  It will be online very soon.

It wasn't moving, just staying in the air.  I pointed it out to my cousin, and she said it must be a plane. Then it started moving, faster than a plane would.  We could clearly see the shape. It was square, with 4 red lights at each corner of the craft.  It seemed to be dark gray or black. Before my cousin had the chance to catch it on film, it was already over Casco Bay and into the Portland area.  Although there may not be any connection, two police cars had their sirens on and started going across the bridge just as it moved into Portland.

These lights were solid points of light.  I'm an avid amature astronomer and right away I knew it was unusual so I told my girlfriend and my other good friend to look at what I was seeing.  We watched these lights ascend diagnally to the south for another 10 seconds and then these lights simultaneously faded out gradually until no longer visible. Again, they were blue solid points of light climbing diagnally one just above the other. These started about 20 degrees off the horison and ended at about 40 degr! ees.

It swooped down, and to one side, then up, to the other side - graceful slow movement.   Finally, as I was talking to the local news station (KATU-TV)it gradually dropped toward the horizon, at a curving angle until I could not see it anymore behind the trees and tall house to west of our building.

      "story": "Interesting yewllow, red and orange lights seen from S.E.  Portland, Oregon. About 10:30 PM, I was sitting on my SE Portland, Oregon patio deck and observed a couple of bright orange- yellowish lights hovering and moving slowly in the South Eastern sky (clear sky, no clouds)-- towards the direction of Mt Scott, Clackamas county. I looked through my binoculars and saw them. They didn't have any other flashing lights as planes do. Their brightness was about the same as a jet's flood light. They seemed to be in the same general vicinity, one of them I had in sight of my binoculars either faded down or disappeared. They were fairly slow, but about as high in altitude as a plane. I don't know how high they were, but they were about level with my neighbor's chimney, which, from where I sat on my deck would be about a 20-25% rise from atop my deck, which is 10 feet above ground level. I used my Suunto inclinometer for this 20-25 percent inclination estimate*. It would be hard to judge the actual distance the lights were from me. Within 10 minutes of this, or about 10:40 PM I got a call from my father who lives only 800 feet (N/W) from my house. He said he saw about 8 reddish lights in the same south eastern sky, they seemed to be moving upwards, and hovering in place, staying close to each other. Ultimately, I don't know if these are flares or Chinese lanterns, or what they were, but found them Odd. I only saw 2, but my father says he saw up to 8. I just felt it important to report.

This evening my wife and I decided to go outside and look for &quot;shooting stars.&quot;  As we lay out on the hammock, I saw four distinct points in the stars that I first assumed to be either part of a constellation or random stars--as it formed an uneven square.  Since we were looking for shooting stars, I paid close attention to the sky.  Within 5 minutes of being outside, I noticed the bottom left point was moving to the right, and the bottom right point was moving away from the square.  Soon thereafter, the former bottom right point continued moving until it disappeared.  At the same time, a new point was moving upwards toward the former square and towards the bottom left point.  I was aghast, surprised, and while my wife reprimanded me on my use of profanity--it is Summer, and my neighbor's windows are open--I noticed the former bottom left, new bottom right point move upwards slightly.  About 10 minutes later the upper left point was moving slightly! to the left, and up, away from the uneven square.  Although I am not a physicist, astronomer, or cosmologist, I am aware that &quot;stars&quot; do not move left, right, or upwards; &quot;stars&quot; do not assume the position of other &quot;stars.&quot;  What did I see?

This is right near the old salvation army building on Burnside and 2ND ave. I can get the exact date I seen this event because I got kicked out for climbing out on the roof at night, simply to use the wifi internet I could not pick up in my room. While I was out on the roof I observed 9-11 brightly light orange spheres in the direction of the airport, from downtown. On the roof of the building, I could see the ground at a distance of apx 15 miles, and estimate the height of the flying objects to be apx 500-1500 feet above ground. The objects held a formation although they did not appear to be of one object.  They started to  slowly move independently of one another. I managed to observe these in flight for about 5-7 minutes.  There are two taller buildings that obscured the view, these orbs passed behind them and finally, I could no longer see them. There were no other objects in my view flying for apx 30 minutes after the sighting.  I simply gave up and went back inside shortly after. As a veteran of the armed forces, and my career in aviation, I feel particular to this event and would be willing to give a more detailed report, please contact me via email or phone and leave me a message.",

It first appeared in the W/SW sky from my position and seemed to be moving in a S/SW heading.  The color and brightness of this object was very soul stirring.  It seemed to hover or move slowly near its position at first, then it appeared to gain elevation and move in an arc trajectory towards the S/SW. The whole sighting lasted for about 40 seconds.  After recognizing that what I was seeing was not natural, I took out my phone and started recording video (about 5 seconds after first seeing the orb.)  However, it only took a couple glances at the screen to see that what I was recording would not be very clear/detailed.  I then focused mostly on the object itself and watched it move until I finally lost sight of it behind a large Douglas Fir tree. I still can't quite wrap my head around the type of fire-like orange light this object generated.  The movement was also outside the norm of any craft I've ever seen.

      "story": "Bright, amber, shimmering light in sky above Southeast Portland At 9:24 PM from the residential east facing slope of Mt. Tabor in Portland, OR I witnessed a light in the sky located South/Southeast approximately between Mt. Tabor and Mt. Scott just below the scattered cloud layer that behaved like nothing I have ever witnessed in the sky before.  I was outside of the house preparing to move my car into the driveway from the street where it was parked.  As I was getting into my car I was now facing south, and before sitting down into the car I noticed a bright, amber, shimmering light in the sky comparable in size and intensity to a street light viewed at 1-2 blocks away.  What drew my attention is that the light was so bright and at this point it was stationary in the sky.  To be clear, there is frequent air traffic over Mt Tabor depending upon flight arrival patterns at Portland International Airport (PDX), so we are very accustomed to witnessing bright jet landing lights and how they appear/behave in the night sky.  Wh! at I was now observing was definitely not any form of conventional aircraft, and was definitely not jet landing or helicopter lights.  Approximately 3 seconds after I began observing the light it very smoothly and rapidly moved from south to north in a straight line toward me covering approximately an eighth of a mile in the sky, though the distances are hard to gauge with the clouds as my only reference point in the sky.  There was no jet noise or any other sound.  The light stopped and hovered stationary again, very bright and clearly visible.  At this point I called my family members that were still in our house via my cell phone from the street to come out and look at this light, because I did not want to lose sight of it.  The light continued to hover for approximately 1-2 minutes with clouds blowing by above the light while the light remained stationary.  By now I had one witness with me observing the light.  Now, the light moved again in the same manner to the east b! y another approximate eighth to one quarter of a mile where it! stopped again, and remained stationary in the sky.  A third witness had now arrived.  We observed the light for another 30 seconds to 1 minute as it hovered stationary in the sky with clouds blowing around it as it sat in a small patch of open sky.  The light must have gained altitude during it\u2019s last movement, because at the end of this period the clouds began to then move in front of the light, became thicker causing the light to fade behind them.  From this point the cloud cover thickened in this area of the sky.  Three of us watched the sky for another 15 minutes but never saw the light again.  I don\u2019t think air traffic control at PDX was routing planes over southeast Portland last night during this event because I did not see or hear any jets while observing this light.",

It made no noise whatsoever. I ran to the front door and told my girlfriend to come outside quickly, which she did. The light was sill approaching our vantage point and moved almost directly overhead.  The oject seemed to be moving parallel to the ground, on a flat trajectory. There is no wind tonight and the sky is cloudless. There were no aircraft in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. If I had to guess, I would say the object was about 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground. When it got just past us, at one point it kind of slowed for a couple of seconds and moved slightly towards the East, then sped up again and continued to travel South. It seemed to me to be traveling somewhat faster than a single engine civilian airplane would at that altitude. The light seem to fade an brighten very slightly at regular intervals. It faded out then disappeared completely as we watched it. The whole sighting probably lasted for two minutes, from about 21:12 to 21:14 hrs. We could not see any larger object surrounding the light, it was noiseless, moved at a constant speed and altitude, and was moving much to fast to be a Chinese lantern. To sum up the event, it was just very strange!  We live within about 5 miles of the Portland Airport, and constantly see commercial, military and private aircraft at all times of the day and night.

      "story": "Three triangular bright orange light objects hovering low in the sky:  Portland, Oregon. At 10:05pm, I walked out of my home and saw three very bright lights hovering low in the southern sky.  All three of these light objects were distinctly triangular in shape.  Each of the three objects were projecting bright orange light in the center surrounded by bright white light at the outer edges. The lights were extremely bright and were facing due north. The orange/white light of each was constant and did not blink or flicker. From my vantage point, they were visible slightly above the roof line and to the left of house across the street from mine. These three lights were hovering far lower than any aircraft I'd ever seen in the downtown Portland skyline . The lights were large enough in the sky that they appeared to be possibly fewer than several miles away in the distance.  I noticed all three of these shapes were slightly swaying in a back and forth  in a fluid horizontal motion but stayed the same size, and kept the same position in the sky. This lasted approximately 45 seconds after which time,  within three seconds, all three of the lights moved very close together without touching, rapidly decreased in size (but without out moving from their relative position in the sky) and then proceeded to completely vanish from the horizon. During this occurrence I also I observed that there were two aircraft with blinking red lights flying in the southern sky from east to west. The two aircraft were fl! ying much further off in the distance and appeared to be moving at a constant speed which I considered to be consistent with commercial aircraft. I heard distinct sound from the two aircraft in the distance but did not hear any discernible sound from the three other light objects that I witnessed. Note: My home is located 4.5 miles North or downtown Portland, Oregon. I am a 36 year old mother of two, I formerly worked in the field of counseling, and I have never before observed anything unusual in the sky. I took one photo and one short video clip with my camera phone. The objects appear white and round in the images I captured, which may be due to the image quality.",

      "story": "Cluster of bright orange lights floating, jumping around in sky While driving home last night, around 9:30pm with fairly clear skies I saw about 4 distinct lights floating in the sky. They appeared to be moving together but not connected. They were very bright orange and high up, probably as high as a plane flying at a very low cruising altitude \u2013 or a helicopter at a very high flying altitude.  I would describe the movement like hot air balloons, but a few would move up or down ( in relation to the others from my perspective.. could have been side to side ) in what seemed to be a controlled pattern. As I drove I thought it was very strange , trying to focus on the road but very distracted by what these lights were. When I came to an intersection where more of the sky was visible I saw so many more, at least 30. Others have reported seeing 50-100 earlier in the evening! I saw them moving west to east.  Mostly in a cluster , a few trailed off behind. At this point I was very shocked and pulled over, and got out of my car ! to look. I took a photo and video with my cell phone but since my camera is not that great - the photos are blurred and hard to distinguish. The Extremely bright orange lights were like nothing I have seen. They did not flicker or pulse, just a steady bright light. The 30 (estimate) lights moving kept going slowly \u2013 to the west. Some would rotate around others... or move to different parts of the group but as a whole they all seemed to be going west. There were many people looking up at the sky wondering what they were. ( it is a downtown area \u2013 many restaurants bars etc... ) One particular bar/grill by my apartment appeared to have all the patrons outside pointing and wondering what the lights were. Eventually, they faded into the distance as they all moved west and disappeared into the night sky. After doing some research I discovered these lights were around Portland a few hours earlier as well, as reported by many others (http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/nov/15/experts-uncertain-about-reports-strange-lights-ove/)  This was a true phenomenon .  In my entire life I have not heard of any atmospheric or natural occurrence like this. (Apparently no one else has either.) A local museum suggested it sounds like it was in the atmosphere \u2013 but from my perspective it sure seemed like they were floating / moving at the altitude described above.",

It was between 18:00-19:00 in the evening, with a clear sky.  Looking to NNW, we saw two \u2018fireball\u2019 structures flash through the night sky momentarily (for approximately 3 seconds).  They were \u2018falling\u2019 vertically, as if they were meteorites.  However, I have seen several meteorites (3 over 3 years) while living here, and these were slightly different as I did not immediately identify them as such.  We both saw them, and did not have an immediate explanation. One was slightly larger, primarily white with orange around the edges (no streaking tail) and the other showed up almost simultaneously a short distance down and left of the original structure.  This one was slightly more orange, also with no tail.  They fell through the sky for a short second and disappeared.  They were ill-defined, as if glowing, whereas most meteorites I have seen have clearly defined margins.  I have never seen 2 simultaneously, and all others I have seen have a streaking tail as they fall through the sky. I am not sure if we saw meteorites or not, but I was intrigued when I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast speaking of increased fireball sightings- otherwise I would not have thought twice about it.

What struck me as odd was first the lights how they went down vertical instead of aircraft lights going horizontal across the sky. I at first only saw one that was in front of my vehicle off in the horizon at like I said 75 degree angle from the earth\u2019s surface.  Then to the SE I noticed two more floating about 5000 meters apart.  From my vantage point.  Then they began to move in a counterclockwise movement through the sky like they were surveying the surface because one of them came as low as the Hard deck of 2000 ft. Altitude.  Then I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed another in the West behind me.  Then off to the North was two more for a total of five making what seemed like a continuous motion still lights vertical.  In a counterclockwise movement, one I noticed began to hover over the Airport of Portland or near the I-205 bridge going into Washington state. The lights draped down vertical with first row of lights going down being white, then a second row was red, then a third row was white with a fourth row that was green. What made me question that they couldn\u2019t be planes is how the lights that seemed to be to the front of the vessel.  Would in unison begin with the first row of lights going down then going up while the Red ones went up while the next row of white lights went up as the row of green lights went down as they illuminated.  I saw one as it seemed to begin a turn and the vessel was shaped on the front where the lights were with a sem-circle front that shaped downward with flat like sides. What really was odd about them was how they would move almost like floating then do a maneuver of 180 degree turnaround and head back the opposite direction.  So I called the Police they told me to call UFO Center and the Airport Air Traffic.  So I called the Center first.  Was asked if I had a camera to capture on video?  I had my Windows Phone with a great camera on it for a phone.   So I got off the phone and began taping the incident.  I was able to capture almost 5 minutes of video.  I did not think I was getting it but I did.  So later as I arrived home I called the FAA and they told me that the Police had Cesna 172\u2019s up chasing bad guys.   So I looked them up to see the fuselage shape and lighting.  There is no way these were Cessna 172s.   I am sure after viewing my video coverage you will see what I mean.  Especially the one I caught overhead of my apartment how it moved across the night sky.  When I arrived home I noticed more further up in our atmosphere 10 more just stationary.   I hope this helps the center with their research into this incident.",

My fiance and I walked out to the Columbia River in North Portland to view the sunset, as we do on an almost nightly basis.   We gazed west, looking across the Interstate Bridge that connects Portland, Ore. to Vancouver, Wash. We noticed a bright, round light that appeared to be several miles away.  The light hovered in one spot for several seconds and then disappeared.  My fiance said, \"It must have disappeared behind a cloud.\"  However, there were no clouds in the sky that night.  A few seconds later the light reappeared slightly to the right of its original location.  It then hovered in the same spot for several seconds before disappearing for the second time.   A few seconds later it reappeared just to the right of its last position. Here's where it got weird. The light remained in one spot without moving and then started to grow from a round, bright light into a long, cylindrical shape, and began shining brighter.  It then appeared there was a line in the middle and the two sides grew outward but were still connected.  It also seemed to be rotating in place. At this time a fighter jet scrambled from Portland International Airport and began flying toward the object.   The now oblong light continued hovering and rotating in place before finally dimming and disappearing for good.",

      "story": "I observed the following by eye & through binoculars. Whilst watching the New Years Fireworks from my 2nd story which affords me a good southerly view I noticed two orange lights flying in sync along the southern horizon. I know what aircraft look like as my home is in a flight path for PDX airport. My interest was piqued as the lights differed from the planes that I see as they were not red or white but orange.  First the two objects were flying east to west in a formation which seemed quite strange i.e one of the lights was low on the horizon and behind the other light that was higher up from the horizon, plus they seemed to be flying at a fast speed, not zipping across the sky at an unfeasible speed but faster than planes tend to go . Another brighter, whiter light that I took to be a plane flying along the normal South to North air route for Portland International airport was flying to the West of the orange lights and didn't garner my attention until it started to fade out,  I don't know how but it was there then started to diminish and was gone.  At this time the lower light was no longer there (I don't know how it went it just wasn't there anymore) whilst the other kept along the east west path it was on and too faded out of my view. Then I saw another light that seemed similar to the two previous orange lights much lower on the horizon, for about 20 seconds which then dropped away from my view beyond the horizon. Shortly after this a plane one with the white and flashing lights came into view and flew an arc westward over towards Portland City Center.  This gave me the impression that the other lights I saw were quite a ways off and going much faster than this plane. I viewed the orange lights through my binoculars and did not see the red and white flashing lights that planes normally have.  It may be that they were aircraft that did not exhibit the normal night time lights, but these had no flashing lights on them, were in a formation and seemed to be moving fast. I wanted to put this up as I am intrigued to see if any other folks saw this or have an opinion on what I saw.

So, I do a double-take, get up from the couch and walk to the window to look out to the northwest at these four orange-ish red lights seemingly hovering in the sky.  I say to my wife, \u201cAre those...what are those? Come here!\u201d By the time she gets to the window one of them has moved higher and disappeared, so there are only three lights left. They hovered in the sky, eventually moved up over the next 90 seconds or so and then disappeared. These were not planes or stars. Shortly after the lights disappeared a plane was flying rather close to the horizon heading east, and it was clearly a plane with flashing lights.  The previous four lights were not blinking or flashing and moved up out of sight, not to the left or right.  I don't know what they were but they were certainly unlike any flying object I've ever seen!",

Off in the distance, to the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon, I saw an *extremely* brilliant seemingly stationary object in the sky.  Distance unknown.  It was white, incredibly bright, and pulsed or twinkled...not unlike a bright light through a lens, or a distant twinkling star...except this thing was huge compared to what a star or planet looks like, and many magnitudes brighter...and it was still mostly daylight out.  I cannot emphasize enough the brightness of this object.  It was akin to Venus at its brightest on a clear night in the country, only it appeared so much larger than Venus ever does.  Without being able to gauge the distance, I have no idea as to its actual size.  It could have been anywhere from a mile away to several dozen miles away, but from my point of view it was about half the size of a dime held at arm\u2019s length. As I approached the spot I always use to turn around, so I can park facing north, I stopped and watched the object for maybe 2 more minutes.  At no time, did it move or change intensity.  Even though it seemed way too bright, I kind of expected it to just be an airplane coming up over the horizon, directly at me, and that after a few moments the perspective would change and the light would look different.  I then realized I was sitting parked in the middle of the road, so I proceeded to turn around as usual, all the while keeping an eye on the object either directly or through a mirror.  When parked, now facing north, I continued to watch the still stationary object in my driver\u2019s side mirror for up to another 30 seconds or so.  I then got out to take a better look, and in the time it takes me to open my door, the object apparently had vanished.  I did not directly witness it vanish, but I had only taken my eye off of it for a split second.  If it had been an airplane, comin! g up over the horizon, making it appear stationary, then I still would have been able to see the plane itself after the perspective of the light changed.  But there was nothing in the sky there.  Nothing coming or going...left or right, away or towards.  I also did not hear any airplanes or helicopters.  I continued to watch that spot and surrounding areas for several more minutes and did not see anything at all in the sky, anomalous objects or otherwise. There was a gentleman waiting at a bus stop about 50+ feet away.  We noticed each other looking southward, but being shy I did not go over and speak with him.  I wish I had now.

While looking up at the stars I noticed what appeared to be a light, similar in size and brightness to a star moving across the sky.  It travelled at a speed faster than any plane I have ever witnessed, yet slower than a shooting star.  I alerted my two friends to what I was seeing and they two witnessed this light moving across the sky. We observed this light for approximately 10 seconds and assumed it was a satellite, or perhaps some sort of comet.  However, the light then made a sharp right turn, while maintaining its velocity.  In my estimation it turned approximately 80 degrees to the right in a matter of seconds.  The arc of the objects turn resembled the curving angle of a hockey stick. Approximately 5 seconds after making its turn the object disappeared as if the light was suddenly turned off. The object we witnessed left no visible trail and appeared to be out of the atmosphere.  Its appearance can best be described as a bright star. When I first noticed the object it was travelling west by southwest before turning south.",

They were very close to each other like they were in formation; the objects were coming from the East between Portland and Mitchellville Tn to the west towards Springfield Tn.

After the third ball of light gained altitude a fourth came from the same direction in the same manner.   These bright balls of red/orange followed the same flight pattern except for the first two that flew together.  There were a total of six.  As far as the timing in between each I can\u2019t tell you, but they were coming one after another and right before they would disappear the next one would show up.   For about 13 years, I use ! to live on the edge of the Dunnellon FL. Airport, were they trained acrobatic planes and I have never seen any normal planes fly that close to one another. There was absolutely no sound and I would think six planes one after another would be very noisy.

This craft was followed by another craft that looked the same.  They flew slightly faster than an airplane and at a lower altitude.

There seemed to be a low sound but it was hard to hear because we were standing right near the 405 freeway in between Salmon and Taylor St.  It was difficult to tell how large the objects were but they seemed to be around the size of a small plane.  They were bright red and seemed to pulse at a rate close to human heart beat so the light was emitted constantly.

I thought, at first, that he was talking about a fly in the room or something.  He said it was a yellow object but was going too slow to be a plane. That's when I saw them. I got out of bed, very agitated, and looked out all the skylights.  Truly, my first thought was that they were UFO's because I had never seen anything like it before. I went downstairs in the dark as I didn't want to draw attention to myself to the, so I thought, UFO's.  I went to my slider looking into my backyard to get a better look. What I saw were circular objects that looked like yellow/orange fireballs larger than a bright star but smaller than a full moon.  They were traveling from my right to my left at about a 45 degree angle in height.  They were traveling in sets of 3 in a triangular formation.  I probably saw 9 of them.  I said, \"They just keep coming!\"   As I was looking at them, I called 911 to report what I was seeing.  Then I told the dispatcher I had to get my binoculars to see what the heck they were.  I was able to see them thru my binoculars, but I didn't see anything different than what I was seeing with my naked eye/no other shape or form.   The sighting lasted about 3 minutes or so.  Still agitated, I went back upstairs to bed.  WOW!",

      "story": "Large teal circle followed by helochopters hours later. Over a year ago, I believe I saw a UFO.  However, due to that night's events and how tired I was, I could be mistaken.   The night in question took place just after an article was released about US and Chinese naval ships dealing with USOs in the pacific off the coast of San Francisco.   I was listening to Clyde Lewis in Portland talk about the article and discuss various UFO sightings.  This is part of the reason I think what I saw may be wrong.  There is also the fact that near the beginning of my shift, I was working as a security guard at an apartment complex in Portland, there was some sort of big celebration taking place with giant search lights moving across the sky.   Additionally, I also hallucinate when I get very tired, however, I don\u2019t recall be that tired during that particular night. Now, the search lights started their thing as soon as it got dark.  They were white beams and would reflect off the clouds when they came across them.  Nothing spectacular about them and they were out after a few hours.   Clyde Lewis\u2019s show was still going for since time after they went dark.  His show was also still going when I saw a new green search light going across the sky.  At least I thought it was a search light as I watched it travel from the eastern horizon and disappear in to the west.   What changed my mind into thinking it was a UFO is that it traveled in a straight line, never returned and was clearly traveling above the clouds since it would momentarily disappear when it passed by one.  Thus, I am sure it was not the beam from a search light.  Also, the suspected UFO was moving very fast and seemed very large.  Also, its color was a solid bright teal.  So basically I think I saw a teal circle of light UFO. Now, had I just seen that light I could have written it off.  But, what happened a few hours later makes me wonder.   Clyde\u2019s show was over and I had switched to coast to coast.  So the occurrence happened sometime after midnight PST.   Now this occurrence was the unusual appearance of 4, presumably black hawk, helicopters flying fairly low and over the same path the teal light took.  There was one difference though.  The 4 helicopters seemed to stop over the Willamette River for a couple minutes before separating.  One headed south.  Another north.  The third went North West and the final one stayed above the river for a few more minutes before continuing west. There you go.  That\u2019s my potential UFO sighting.

Facts:   On December 31, 2013, at approximately 21:40 hours, while looking up at a clear sky from the approximate location of 45.527205 N, -122.688007 W, I saw a small object that was brilliantly illuminated in a white color moving due Southwest from near Jupiter in the night sky in the direction of Orion\u2019s belt.  Since the only scale I had for the object was the night sky and planets and stars, I could not determine the object\u2019s size or altitude.  The object continued tracking Southwest for a few seconds, and as it did, it began to glow a bright reddish-orange color.  It could be best described as the color seen in NASA spacecraft re-entry animations. The object then made a precise turn when it appeared near the background of the Easternmost star in Orion\u2019s belt, and at what appeared to be a nearly 45 degree angle toward the East-Northeast at a higher rate of speed and moved away from my line of sight.  I made an effort to re-acquire it visually, but was unable to do so due to a building blocking my view. I was unable to observe a specific object shape, and I do not know if there were several lights on it, or if it was simply one light. Observations:   I have listed the event duration as 5-10 seconds, however, I must admit that the sight of the object was immediately disconcerting since it did not behave in an aerodynamic way. The actual duration could have been simply 5 seconds, given the apparent rate of speed of the object. I estimated that rate of speed to be extraordinarily high, since I also estimated the altitude of the object to be high as well, given that I could not even determine its shape. It is important to note that the object moved in exacting straight lines both Southwest and East-Northeast. The object did not make arced or rounded movements. The object also did not demonstrate the motions of anything organic like a bird or insect. The immediate shift in motion of the object eliminated my first conclusion that I had witnessed a shooting star.  Also, the color on the object became brighter as it moved East-Northeast, rather than fading.  I have done an exhaustive search for any optical illusions that could explain the change of direction and found none. I want to disabuse anyone investigating this of the notion that I viewed this as a metaphysical or spiritual occurrence.  I did not \u201cfeel\u201d the object, have \u201cpsychic communication\u201d with it, or in any way view it as a sign or contact.  It was merely an observation of an object moving in a way that I cannot explain, and that startled me. I am able to make this report as a result of immediately recording the time, my location, and observations, since I maintain a personal and professional notebook while I am working.",

I was driving in a northerly direction, about 20 MPH, and saw lights moving in a southerly direction.  They were so distinct that I quickly stopped to observe them. So I'm looking to my left (west) and I see these strange lights moving pretty fast, not supersonic but I'm guessing about 720 mph.  (See below.)  They were 6 of them, in a formation that changed as they moved.  It initially looked like two in the lead, side by side, two following in a straight line between the two leading, and two more in the rear that were side by side.  The formation appeared to change as they moved along.  They appeared to come closer to the earth, then moved up in height and veered toward the west, disappearing into the night sky.  This whole thing took place in a period of maybe 2 minutes or less. I was cursing myself for not having my camera, which I almost always have, but then thought I might as well do what I can with the iPhone. They had a strange light that looked like an umbrella, actually more like an inverted U,  and they glowed with a bit of orangeness.  There was no flickering.  And they looked nothing like an airplane.  I wondered if they could be helicopters and cranked down my window and there was no noise, from anything, even on the ground.  There was no traffic and it's a quiet area of Portland.  Besides, I've seen many helicopters at night over the years and these were much higher (I'd guess maybe 1-2 thousand feet) and were moving in a way that was unfamiliar to me. I am including the pictures I took with my iPhone4S, with explanatory notes.  I have not edited these pictures at all. This first shot was taken at 8:35:27.  I don't know the source of the light pollution on the right of the picture.  The objects were heading southwesterly and beginning to ascend. This second shot was taken at 8:35:32.  An expert on speed/distance might be able to calculate the speed of the objects by comparing the movement with the times shot.  I'm guessing at distances but looking at the map, am estimating they would have traveled from an area around Windham, Me, to somewhere around Waterboro, Me.  in the approximate 2 minutes I watched them.  This would put their speed at 720 miles per hour if I'm right. The third shot was taken at 8:35:50.  Note the comparative distance traveled in 18 seconds.  Speed?  See above. This last shot was taken at 8:36:41.  This was 51 seconds later and the first two of the lights had ascended, moving towards the southwest, and disappeared in the night sky. Finally, the time from the first shot to the last shot was 1 minute, 14 seconds.  If they were traveling 720 miles per hour, this would mean they covered about 35 miles while I watched, including about 45 seconds before I started taking the pictures.  This seems approximately right. My background:  I have a Bachelor's Degree from a 4-year, accredited university and am 71 years old.  I am a professional photographer, and tried to copy pictures of the event taken with my iPhone.  I didn't have my DSLR with me.",

I can saw with pretty much certainty it wasn't an object in (Outer) space, due to the fact it was pretty cloudy and overcast.  You could not see any stars or the moon.  So taken from that, it had to have been in the atmosphere.  Anyways, It was blinking brightly, then would slowly dim, while still blinking, till it \"blinked\" out, so to speak. This would happen over the course of 1 - 3 minutes.  Once it \"blinked\" out, it would be gone for like 4 - 5 minute, then reappear, all of a sudden, in what seemed to be the exact same place.  This went on for at least 15 minutes, that we (the ones who witnessed it) were outside. \"To be left off the record\" My wife and I, who witnessed the event, are believers in ufo/aliens/other life existence besides earth.  I personally have never seen anything, nor would I wish to draw attention to myself or my wife.  With that being said,  My wife did take a video of it along with some pictures, I can get from her and send via e-mail.

It began to dim until it disappeared completely.  I didn't believe that it was a planet or a star because it was underneath a cloud cover, it did not appear to be a plan because it was moving slower than a plane and at times remained still.   Moments later it reappeared bright red again then dimmed and disappeared this was over a period of 15 minutes and after appearing a second time it did not reappear.   I had posted a message on facebook asking if anyone else had saw the bright red light, about an hour later at 20:08 hours a friend who lives 20 miles SW from me responded to my post stating that they could see it and as! ked me what it was.

The lights were constant in brightness and duration with no flashes or blinking, not like any plane, jet, helicopter or thing I have seen.  If you could imagine for idea of position of the lights, the face of a clock; one light was at 12 o'clock and one was in the 5 o'clock position.  They stayed in these positions relative to one another the entire time I saw them. They moved on a path not like any aircraft I have seen, moving east to west, slightly dropping to the south before moving back to the north as it was traveling east to west the whole time.  With solid white-yellow lights the entire time.  Many aircraft travel over view from my balcony from the 3rd floor, news and law enforcement helicopters; private, freight, and commercial planes and this was not the same.

Around 17:30hrs (+/- a few minutes or so), sitting in the living room of my brothers home, my brother and I more or less faced the north-facing window.  All the sudden a bright white flash occurred.  The flash seemed from our perspective, to move from our right, to our left, at a extremely high rate of speed.  The line of sight from where we were looking from, to the general area of the flash in the sky, seems to be somewhere between 25' to 35' degrees up, illuminating through the trees that stood between the flash and where we were sitting at the time.  Trees vary between coniferous and deciduous, with intermittent uninterrupted lines of sight periodically.  We both agreed that the flash originated beyond the aforementioned trees at an unknown distance. We suspected most likely, it was a meteor flash.  But, it did seem slightly odd even for a meteor flash, so I feel this should at least be archived.  We both agree that we saw the exact same event, in exactly the same details upon comparison, to the best of my knowledge.  We monitored the local news for anything related to what we witnessed, which amounted to nothing by the next following morning. More likely, may have been a meteor flash.  But, feel unexplainably compelled to document this event, as this report may prove to be a useful reference for some type of research in the future.",

      "story": "CT RIVER PENINSULA SIGHTING(s).  2 Witnesses kayaking just before dawn. 3-6am. 6/21/14 A longtime friend and I were fishing in kayaks on the Connecticut River.  He and I are both 34 year old college educated males.  We both work nights (I've been a full time firefighter EMT-B  for 7 years), so it's not unusual for us to go out in the CT river or on the Mattabasset all night and stay out sometimes into the next day until almost lunchtime.   I am (or was) a UFO skeptic.  Always have been.  He is a believer.  I usually roll my eyes and laugh at some of the things he's said he's seen in the past.  But this came out of nowhere.  We weren't looking for it.  We were trying to catch some bass.  No drinking or substances involved.  Just glad to be not at work with no obligations and fishing finally. We started the trip from the Portland Fairgrounds...  May or may not be entirely right to launch from where we did, but it was getting late and we wanted to get in.  Both of us have bright LED's that illuminate the surrounding water and trees.  We put the fishing off to head way down river (south).  I kept asking when we were going to be at this \"spot\" my friend had fished in the past.  Was a long trip down river.  Probably a few miles.  So when we saw what we both saw, we may have been near Portland, Cromwell, Rocky hill, Wethersfield, Glastonbury...  I'm not 100% sure.  But local fisherman have nicknamed the spot \"the peninsula\".  It's an island in the middle of the river near \"Perzold's Marine/Marina\".  We were heading to the back side the peninsula (downstream). Still in the middle of the CT river, We both saw something in the sky to the East.  It was bright white, big, crescent shaped, appeared suddenly and went down diagonally and to our left, moving very fast, until it disappeared behind the tree line.  We both said \"Whoa!\"  At the same time. We talked about it afterwards and I kept thinking of things it could've been but they all turned out to be impossible.  Closest I could think of would've been a comet or shooting star... But this was too big, too white, no tail, & too fast.  It happened very quickly and was gone. So we kept moving.  Our moment of wonder was soon replaced by the fact that we were at the peninsula and it was time to fish now.  My friend went to shore and started a fire on the beach area.  I kept paddling and casting near the shore for a bit before heading over.  I got out and we got a small fire going.  (Fire ordinances don't apply if you're in the middle of the river just before sunrise and don't know exactly what town you're technically in... right? Lol)...  Then it got wierd enough to remember for a long time and even report on here (I can't believe I'm doing this btw.)... I was standing by the fire.  For some reason I got the urge to look back over my right shoulder and up at the sky...  Why?  Because something was there.  That's the only reason I can think of why I'd look. I had already forgotten about the other event.  I looked up and saw a strange light moving a great distance at a medium pace, steadily in a straight line towards us across the sky (was heading west toward the Wethersfield side of the river.)  Things then escalated to wierd level 2: the thing had one bright light.  And as it got closer to being over head the light got dimmer and dimmer until it vanished completely. No clouds. Perfectly clear, still dark, just before dawn. It was gone. I turned my head back to my friend who was over on the left casting his line into the water. I quickly told him what I just saw and how wierd it was. He turned to look at me as I was talking. I looked up at the sky again and what we saw next made us both yell out profanities at exactly the ! same time. Diagonally In front of us, slightly northwest but just overhead, something shot across the sky faster than anything man made can move and in a way that stars, comets, or anything like that can move. This display, to me had \"technologically advanced machine\" written all over it. It made a line in the sky visible for less than a second. It was bright white and shaped like an archer's bow. Fast as hell and bright white. But this time, it didn't disappear afterwards. It looked as if it went hundreds of miles in a second to the north, and then stopped and hovered just above the tree line. And as it hovered it turned towrard us. And then it was possible to see more of its shape. It wobbled like a saucer as it turned toward us and then sat in a fixed position \"watching us\" as we fished. The front view it allowed us showed a multicolored string of lights around its cylindrical, saucer shaped perimeter. It say there for a while in the sky just before s! unrise, almost as if it was waiting for us to come to terms wi! th what we both saw, talk about it, and get comfortable with it to the point that we could just fish, know it's there, talk about it, and move on... Which is what we did basically. I've texted and talked about it with him in person since it happened just to verify the reality of it. I was completely blown away. There was no way I could dispute this or write it off as something else. He's happy because he \"won\", in that sense. But all I can think about now is wanting to see more. And I feel like a gift of knowing there's some other beings up there has been given to me. Pretty awesome. Next trip, I'll have my iPhone ready to take pics instead of tucked away in the watertight box I keep it in. Have even thought about getting a telescope. I'm amazed. That's all I can say. Thanks.",

I shouted, \"Look at the sky!!\" We both ran over to the window and for the next maybe four seconds, watched as the colors changed.  Then it was just gone.

Tuesday night, at about 9:45 PM, July 15, 2014, in Southeast Portland, Oregon, as stars and satellites began twinkling, I saw a bright white light race across the sky from west to east. The brightness was like an Iridium flare from a satellite, only it was much larger in radius that a satellite appears to our eyes.  I do not think it was a satellite because it was moving so fast and because the glow was so much larger than satellite.  I do not think it was an airplane or helicopter either, because the speed was way too fast, there were no other lights besides the consistent glow, and the single white light was larger than any light I've seen on an airplane at night.   Also there was no sound. If it had been in aircraft and if it had been flying that fast and presumably low enough to produce a light that large, then I expect I would've heard some noise but there was none.   The flight path was west to east over highway 26 in Southeast Portland (Powell Blvd.)  Many local aircraft fly this route but none fly it as fast as this: approximately 8 seconds from west horizon to east horizon.

      "story": "Neon Green Stealth like sphere with pulsating lights, witnessed by 2 adults and a child. May 24th, around 9:30pm, I was sitting outside on my front patio.  The sun was just begining to set. My Neighbor's daughter was playing two doors down and something in my head had told me to look up towards the horizon.  I'm in a partially vegitated area with large trees, so if I were to just lok in that direction, trying to look for a specific object, chances are that I would not have been able to spot what I saw. I was smoking a cigarette at that time, and as I said, \"Something in my brain had told me to focus in that specific direction as if I was being told so.\"  As I looked up, my neighbor's child said, at the same time I saw it and said, \"Mommy! Mommy! Mommy, come here quick!  Look at pretty green light in the sky!  What is it?\"   She came out and immediately started to panic and thats when I said, \"Am I really Seeing this? Am I crazy or are you seeing this too!\"  There was a very bright, pulsating chartruess spherical object, moving at a high speed, and very low altitude.  It was a very bright neon like color sphere and it made not one sound.  I cannot tell you how big it was but, it was literally pulsating with light.   At first I thought it was an airplane since I live just down the road about 10 miles from a small airport.  The name of the airportis, Hillsboro Aviation.  (So if you need to call them to see if they picked up anything on radar, you have te name.)  When it went over us, there was absolutely zero sound.  I even tuned into background noise to make sure there was a jet exhaust sound.  Absolutely zero noise!  And the strange thing was, being so close to an airport, theres constant air traffic.  When this approached, there was not one aircraft in the sky.  So we would have heard it.   I ran out to the to a clearing and watched it continue from it going northbound.  I contined observe to se if I could make out any form of object.  It immediately came to a hault in mid air.  By that time, it was very close to the airport and then it began to flash and get brighter. It sat there for a good two minutes.   At that time, I decided to make a run for my phone to snap a shot.  As I came back out and was fumbling with my camera,  I looked up, and it made slight turn and began to move, then it took off at a blink of an eye.   This is the second time I've seen these spheres.  I've seen blue ones in the Tillamook National Forest coming home from Salmon fishing.  And they were in the forest, then bolted out into a meadow.  They moved so fast that the trees swayed as they exited the forest and were spinning around the sky, then disapeared into orbit.",

I was seated in a window seat approx. 6 rows in front of the wing at that time.  Around 15 minutes prior to landing (NE approach), I noticed an unidentified object in the sky, while viewing the landscape below.  We were still several thousand feet off the ground (houses were approx. 5mm in size) at this time.  The object appeared to be stationary and approximately 1000 feet below us and to the left of the plane.  It consisted of a cluster of round metallic objects making up the top half of the craft, which via a circular midsection joined an elongated four sided pyramid as the bottom half.  All areas of the craft were silver and reflective in nature.  The top half can best be described as if you created a larger sphere out of adjoining smaller spheres.  This top half was not elongated or billowing in the wind as a weather ballon might do. I observed the object for approx. 5 seconds, as my plane passed by.  My view of the object was excellent.  There were no clouds in the sky, and I could see multiple details of the craft.  I did not note any vapors or heat waves emanating from the craft.  After we left the craft behind, I began scanning objects on the ground to reference the crafts size.  My best guess is comparing it to a semi truck while we were 600 ft above it. Others may have seen this craft but no one said anything on the flight.  Unfortunately we passed by too quick to take a picture, but I am 100% certain of what I saw.",

Every 8 seconds or so, the radiant blue light became an intense white light for about 1 second, and then became a dull red before becoming an intense blue again.  This happened probably 4 times before the object dipped below the some apartments to the east of me. \tI've never seen something that I couldn't explain like this before and thought I should describe it.  My girlfriend also witnessed this UFO and agrees that it could not have been any aircraft the two of us are familiar with.  I couldn't really see a craft shape very well, but she feels that when it went from the white light, which was VERY bright like search lights, back to red and then blue, it kind of seemed like the object was rotating.

Many points of light and one was crescent shaped, like a modern parachute. As we kept watching we realized they were not getting any closer and there were some that appeared either smaller or farther away and two were red, for a total of 14 items. All of these items pretty much kept their scattered distance as they slowly proceeded from east to west but the odd thing it the crescent shaped object rotated very slowly\u2026perhaps twice over the 15 or so minutes we saw them. I thought that with the height of the sun, it may be reflection off some space debris but when first spotted, the convex side of the crescent object was illuminated but when it rotated 180 degrees the convex side was still illuminated, but should have been in the shadow.  Also, the two red objects were very bright red. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD))",

It had red and blue lights flashing, like an airplane or helicopter, and it was the size of a small airplane, but did not have wings.

It traveled from the south side of the hill to about the middle of the hill.  Normally planes fly over our house at an extremely high altitude, but this was very low and moving so fast, I thought it was going to crash.  But then it disappeared behind the trees.   I thought it could have been a helicopter, but it didn\u2019t look like a helicopter and it was going way too fast to be one.  About 2 seconds later, it darted out and went north to south.  Then, after it hover! ed for about 2 seconds it took off, going south to north again.  It was zig zagging like this for about 30 seconds, and it was very unsettling, it seemed like it was scanning the area.   I didn\u2019t want to be outside anymore because it was very frightening, so I ran to my front door carrying my daughter and we got inside fast.

But it did not look or sound like a helicopter. It had very bright red lights on top that were glowy and vibrant.  White lights on bottom.  It was moving fast and I followed it for a couple blocks out of my direction and it disappeared from my sight behind houses.  I allowed it to get away and continued biking home.   Once I reached the very top of the hill near Alameda, I decided to stop because it's a good place to see the sky.  I wasn't assuming I had seen anything extraterrestrial, more that it was truly bizarre.  I was only standing at the top of the hill for less than a minute when straight ahead of me (facing south) I saw a very, very bright light.  I thought it was a satellite. It was staying in one place and not seeming to move at all.  It was s! haped like a hat almost, pointed on top, similar to a triangular shape.  I stared for a very longtime, then noticed to it's left was the same object, slightly lower.  Meaning there were two.  I started filming and trying to take pictures on my iphone that are hard to decipher due to all of the other lights around. I also called my boyfriend to tell him what I was seeing. After almost 15 minutes they started moving in a west direction, pretty quickly. So they were not stars. Definitely not planes. (At least not the usual commercial flying planes). Last night (11/14/14), two days later I was driving home with my boyfriend, when straight ahead in the sky, we saw the exact same two shapes on the exact same place moving the exact same way. We both watched together as they stood in one place for a long time, then began movingn together in the same direction out of sight. This was all from Irvington Neighborhood.

      "story": "I saw 5 UFOs over Portland, Oregon, on November 23, 2014. On November 23, 2014, at 6:20 pm I believe I saw an unidentified flying object.   My room is seperate from the house.  To get into the house I have to walk up the back deck leading to the back door of the house.  So, on my way into the house from my room I looked up into a pretty dark sky.  Cloudy.   There directly northward were 3 lights.  Pretty big lights.  The shape was indescribable from the distance. I examined them as closely as I could.  They had my attention because the more I looked the more I realized that these are not the airplane or helicopter lights that are commonly seen at night in my SE Portland area near the Sellwood Bridge.  (Which by the way is currently under construction.)   On any night one would have no problem spotting airplanes coming from the south.  More common than ones coming from the north.  I've seen as many as 4 helicopters hovering over the city at one time late at night from 11pm and on.   Anyways, there I stood on the deck right outside th! e back door looking at these 3 lights that I noticed moved around very strangely in ways you could not expect from conventional aircraft.  Side to side.  Down, up and in circles.  While it was hard to see the shape I could see they were orange and red in color.  And sometimes just white.   As 2 of the lights slowly began to fade away, 2 more extra bright lights slowly began to appear from the horizon.  They moved higher and higher.  The first 3 had some manner of formation but were definitely independent of each other.  The 2 new bright lights came in formation but then split up as they got closer to the rest.   For a short time all 5 were together before 2 of what I believe were the first set of 3 faded away out of sight.  The 3 remaining did a slow dance.  Unpredictable in nature.  And offbeat.  At least 2 or 3 more times I saw 1 or 2 fade away and another 1 or 2 appear to rise from the horizon.   There were too many objects in my vision down lower for me to see where they may be coming from but if I were to guess I would say at least 5 or 6 miles aw! ay.  Probably more, not sure. I shot some shaky video. They only appear to be dots of light on camera.  But, I asked my mother to come look and she watched them for at least a couple minutes.   The entire spectacle lasted about 10 minutes but who knows how long they had been there before I noticed them.  The airport is about 15 miles northeast of where I live. East of where I saw these UFOs.  I live about 15 blocks from the river.  After doing a quick search my mother discovered that there was a UFO sighting earlier the same day in Paris, France.  Sort of similar to what I saw.  I feel like there is more details I should be giving but I'm forgetting.  I called my brother who lives within 2 miles away to look up and see it.  His girlfriend answered the phone and as I was giving my reason for calling they started to fade away.  When I got off the phone they made at least one more brief appearance before disappearing for the last time.  I guess that's all for now.  I'm working on getting a hold of l! ocal news.\t  ((name deleted))",

Due to traffic noise, unable to determine if it did have any type of sound to it. Perhaps, due to the speed it came down, it could have been a sphere rather than cylinder.  The lighting of the object may have just made it appear to be a different shape by causing a light trail behind it. It was not a lantern, falling star or meteorite.

The lights appeared a bit larger than stars and were moving across the sky at a high rate of speed like satellites (but much larger than satellites normally appear).  They were traveling south and toward the horizon;  I was looking west, so it seems that were headed on a southwestern trajectory.   Suddenly, the lights changed their orientation relative to each other, and then the group as a whole changed their direction abruptly and quickly, away from the horizon, and then they disappeared from my view.  This entire episode happened in five seconds and was not long enough in duration for me to get a corroborating witness.  My dog, however, began to look up at the sky without provocation and continued to look at the sky for around thirty seconds, which is atypical for him. I have never seen anything like this and until now have been skeptical of UFO sightings, chalking up any strange phenomena that other people have seen to atmospheric refraction, military testing or just other aircraft.

We were both freaked out when we saw a light appear out of no where.   A UFO appears out of no where trailing the airplane very close and very quickly (again near that area in the sky maybe not Menkar but a star cluster near that star).  No blipping lights, no red, no sound. What was unusual was that as it traveled North we see the back end of the airplanes wings which had extremely bright spotlights which I have never seen before on an airplane.   Then we see another flying craft with no blipping lights, no sound travel from constellation of Orion or a bit east of it.  It again travels towards the North. Possibly fog lights on the back of the wings?  I strongly believe that what we saw was a UFO sighting and activity linked to the bright blue flash.",

      "story": "8 orangey red orbs, floating and flickering in formation in night sky over I-84 on New Year's. It was New Year's Eve in NE Portland near NE Sandy, it had just turned midnight and we went outside to let our kiddo bang pans and ring in the new year.  My kid hurt his hand and yelled out, I turned to see if he was okay and was now facing north toward I-84, I looked at his hand and then he ran back into the house, with his father following him.   I did not follow because as I looked up, I saw some reddish orange orbs in the sky, maybe 50 feet up (just above the one story roof lines of our complex).  They appeared to be floating straight towards me, flickering like candles but synchronized.  I called my husband to come back out.   At first, I was afraid they were some huge embers from NYE fireworks or something and was watching to see if they would burn out or land on our building.   Before they reached our building, they took a  turn to the left (about 12 feet or so from me) though the turn was a right angle, the orbs floated smoothly, not particularly fast, just g! liding and flickering, more kept coming, spaced evenly apart and in some kind of formation, at the same height, spacing and rate.  They were almost floating lantern like but not that and way to small for that.  There were around 8 or so in all.  We walked closer and watched them floating by and flickering, not sure what the heck they were, they moved out of our sight and we went back inside.   It kept nagging at me, so I began to look to see if embers like these were even possible from fireworks (I could find nothing.)  I looked for fires or other reports of these orbs in the local news and saw none but then I stumbled upon a bunch of information online about others reporting floating orange orbs in the sky, all over the world.  (I've never heard of such a thing before.)  I came here to check out reports for Portland on new year's and found nothing, so I thought I should report it.   We are stunned to find this may be UFO phenomena.",

Beginning around 3:55, I went outside for a cigarette and as is my custom, craned my neck staring at the sky.  Spotted the popular three star triangle, and the waning moon to its left. Viewing from the SW to SE skies, directly above me.  In Homestead neighborhood right next to OHSU hospital. It started with one object, I assumed was a star shifting its light.  Then it began to move sporadically, circling and zig-zagging... slowly drifting upwards and to the right.  I used the moon as a still-object to make sure I wasn't seeing things. The longer I watched it, the more it moved.  No blinking or flashing lights.  Quick, sporadic movements in short spurts; sometimes in longer spurts.  Sometimes it grew still. Around twenty minutes into the sighting, while moving in circular motion, a smaller light spat out from it and vanished. I also find it interesting that during this 40 minute time period I saw two very large meteors and several much smaller ones. I report four objects, as there were two other much, much dimmer objects nearby moving in similar fashion. The third appeared after one of the large meteors, zig-zagged a small amount, and then moved on much like an airplane straight across the sky. The other three sightings were not as spectacular as the first, which remained... even after I ran back upstairs to grab my camera. Of course, since the light is the size of a star it was impossible to capture on my digital camera. Also worth mentioning is that last night, my roommate (who also witnessed this sighting) and I were driving home and saw what can only be described as a carousel-like ship.   Rotating slowly and moving slowly, with alternating white lights fading in and out.  They were not blinking, were not airplane beacons and were not red or green. Just white.  Rotating, or spinning, and moving across the sky in a diagonal manner. I am hesitant to label this immediately as a UFO, as it could very well be a drone.  However, due to the strange optical lights, fading alternately; and after doing a few hours of research on drones and their lightings, I found that most drones have stationary or flashing lights much like airplanes... not this gentle, soft fading white lights in alternating fashion. And lastly, on the fourth of July during fireworks, I also saw three star-like objects much like tonight's sighting: sporadic movement and quickly disappearing.  These sightings lasted mere seconds, unlike tonight's sighting in which the first object remained for 40+ minutes. In conclusion, tonight's sighting of the continuous object with sporadic movement: spat out a smaller light that vanished.  A few times very vague trails with its quicker movements.  Wish I had binoculars or a telescope.  Will invest as I seem to be sighting more and more UFOs lately.",

I saw two stars that were close together, kind of similar colors, and I admired their beauty.  Then, I noticed one was kind of moving away from the other... Which stars don't do...  So I kind of laughed at myself for mistaking something for a star and continued my breathing techniques.  So I started wondering what it could be..  Maybe a satellite?  As I continued to ponder the that, I noticed it was flying towards my apartment building.  I was confused. It seemed to be flying lower now... And it was a grayish ship with a big white light and a tiny red one.  I remember it had a pointy cockpit looking thing? It was kind of in the  shape of a bird with a box for a body and without wings.  It had a long neck and then the head, which I thought was probably the cockpit.  I tried taking a video but my memory is full from all the spotify I download. &#128547;&#128516; anyways, I was really sure what I was seeing and wanted to record information that I could review later.  So I tried taking pictures.  Nothing showed up. I saw for a total of about 10-15 minutes total.  I was staring at it when I thought it was a star, because all I could see was the bright light and it was low on the horizon near a bright star (from my perspective).  Then it moved I towards me and flew over my building. It kept going.  I tried calling my mom to run to the front of te apartment facing the way in which the ship flew but she was in the elevator at the time coming in from smoking a cigarette and was not able to see it. When I went to look out our bay window but nothing was flying. I believe in UFOs and believe they can connect us through astral projection(in which case a ship would be unnecessary), but I am a scientist at mind and need more evidence to validate my personal experience.  I hope others report seeing at around 5/15/15 1:20am.  It was a weird shape..  And it didn't make a sound.  The cars were louder so I doubt it could have been a plane and definitely not a helicopter, which given how low it was over the Park Blocks of downtown Portland would have more sense!  It was a UFO &#128529;",

      "story": "Blue streak morphs into flashing lights I am writing this report for my brother because he wouldn't bother reporting it. At approximately 4 am pacific time my brother was driving home from work on I-205 south near the I-84 east exit.  He ran into some traffic and came to a complete stop.  While he was stopped, he decided to pull out his cell phone and take a snapchat video of the horrible traffic to send to his friends.  He took the video, and when he went to review it, noticed that he had caught a strange light in his caption.  I should mention that he is taking this video from inside his car.  His view is looking over the interstate, and an overpass is approximately 1/4 of a mile ahead.  In the video, just a few seconds after the it starts, a bright almost neon blue light streaks down from the upper left of the video screen.  As the light falls from the sky it disappears for a second, then reappears only to come to a complete stop.  It appears that the light is just beyond the overpass 1/4 of a mile ahead.  At the same time this blue streak stops, it lights up and flashing lights rotate in a circular! direction around the \"craft\".  The craft then drops very 'mechanically' or abruptly and continues to flash sporadically until the video ends. I should mention that i have a copy of this video on my computer.  I will send it to you if you want.  Since its a cell phone video, the quality isn't the best, but you can plainly see what I'm describing when you watch it.  I should also mention that in the video, my brother is listening to eminem (the rapper).  My brother says ((profanity deleted)) part way through the video and it seems he is reacting to the UFO, but he is actually reacting to the bad traffic.  It is not till reviewing the video that he notices the light.  Thanks!   I appreciate everything you do and I hear you on coast to coast all the time!  I have a few more amazing sightings that were from a reliable friend of mine that I could share as well. -((name deleted)) from Canby, Oregon ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

As my friend and I were driving west on Hyw 52, entering Portland city limits on the west side of town, we saw a triangle shaped craft headed our way, moving west from the east, directly over the hwy.  It seemed to hover and it made no sound at all!  It finally began to move as we drove under it.   The craft did not bank as a plane would when it turned to change directions.  It remained level and simple turned and slowly drifted off to the north.  It stopped when we quickly turned around and as we approached it again I flashed my head lights franticly and it seemed to know that we were attempting to follow it.   As we got under the craft, that was approximately 100 feet above us, it took off at high speed and as it was leaving, F-18s flew over us at a high rate of speed in pursuit of the triangle-shaped craft.  We watched until they all were out of sight.   The craft had two white lights on the back side of the triangle craft and a bright red light at the front (nose) of the craft.  It was a dark gray color and completely solid.   I am retired Army and have been stationed at Ft. Campbell 101st Airborne/Air Assault Division and have seen all the high tech special ops aircraft in their arsenal and I have NEVER seen anything like  this triangle-shaped craft EVER!  It made no sound at all and was able to hover in place and change direction quickly without making any noise.  It was able to fly at high speed and outrun the F-18s that were in pursuit of it.",

Then the little lights changed to yellow and purple, then back to blue and yellow a few times.  Then it took a 90 degree turn quite quickly and turned completely red while doing so.  At this point I thought maybe it was a drone or a military aircraft. My husband got up and turned around to look at this time.  There was no sound except sort of a high pitched pulsing sound.  My husband described it later as kind of like air moving? He heard it low pitched, I heard it high pitched.  Sort of like a \u201cwaow waow waow\u201d.  We both kind of felt the sound too, like a wave. It kept moving on it\u2019s new path, then took another 90 degree turn and suddenly sped up towards the horizon and disappeared over the roof of the house we were next to.

About a second after I started tracking the object with my eyes, it simply vanished.  While it was visible to me, it looked like how planes look sometimes when you can't see their wings so they look kind of like a UFO until they change angles so you can see the wings.  In that one instant, that's what I thought it probably was, until it disappeared.

      "story": "Multiple sightings of bright white orbs that sometimes flashed brightly. At roughly 8:55pm, Friday, April 1st, 2016, I was standing in my backyard looking up at Polaris to the north and Orion to the S/SW, admiring the clear sky and beautiful weather of the evening.  Suddenly, I noticed a very bright and solid light originating from just to the right of the star Saiph, in the Orion constellation.  The direction of travel was S/SW to N/NE. It was travelling quickly enough to be thought of as a low flying plane, only there were no position or navigation lights or even a strobe light to be seen.  Just a perfectly solid bright white light that did not change in shape or luminosity as it changed its position in the sky.  There was no sound at all. Quite surprisingly, it looked as if the light was drifting ever so slightly to the east, in the same way a gliding bird might be moved by wind currents.  This took the object directly above me.  There it slightly paused for about 1 second as it changed direction and moved in a very straight line directly to the East.  I called my wife and we both watched the light, which continued to make no sound and show no other lighting other than the constant bright white light, until it got smaller and smaller and disappeared into the distance. About 10 minutes later, I returned to the backyard with my Sony A7000 fitted with a 55-210 zoom lens, set to maximum zoom.  Within one minute I saw a faint object flying directly South to North, exactly from where the original sighting began by Orion.  I recorded video as I watched the dim object suddenly grow in brightness (and apparent size, but hard to know if this was just a function the increased glow).  The object was constantly in and out of focus, as the Autofocus struggled to keep up. Again, about 10 minutes later, I returned to the backyard\u2026this time with the camera set to manual infinity focus\u2026and I saw a small faint object moving from the North/Northeast toward the Southeast.  I started recording and called my wife to come back out.  I had no tripod with me.  The object all but disappeared and had been blindly pointing the camera, by hand, at the blank sky where I had roughly last seen it\u2026when suddenly, it flashed in brightness and we could see it rapidly \u201cexpand\u201d and \u201ccontract\u201d after each flash.  Most flashes were very bright, but others were more subtle and undulating.  This did not last long. Perhaps one minute.  This last sighting occurred in the same portion of sky that the initial object had disappeared in to.  I continued to watch and record the sky, but it never flashed again, and I saw no other objects in any other portion of the sky. I have video of the last two sightings.  The last sighting is the best quality due to the manual infinity focus, but they both lacked a tripod so it is unfortunately very shaky.",

We were on way to airport so had to move on and leave without further investigating. Bright light really grabbed our attention and we were trying to figure it out, pulled over on entrance to I-65 to watch and a second brilliant light appeared out of nowhere to the left (South or West) of original light. Extremely clear skies tonight.  This light just blipped into existence unlike aircraft approaching from distances which can obviously be viewed for a while before lights become brighter. Same intensity and brilliance. It moved around the original light to the north and then back around towards  the west a! nd south and became dim.  At this point I thought we saw some flashing lights on the 2nd object as it headed south or south west.  Assumed possible military testing/training out of Clarksville.  The originally light stayed in place while the other circled around it (or looked to do so).  Maybe helicopters?  Either way, out of the ordinary - we come from an aviation family and are used to spotting all sorts of lights and craft.  Fun seeing something different!

The sky was clear and a couple planes were going by.  I glanced up and was looking at the long trail produced out the back of one of the planes, when I noticed what looked like a very bright star in the east by southeast portion of the sky.  It appeared to be above the 33,000 foot cruising altitude and was slightly bigger than the planes which were flying their typical daily routes.  It just stayed in one place.  I pointed it out to my kids because we had never seen  a stationary star in the daylight before.  The rest of my class gathered around us and we all stopped and watched it.  It seemed to slowly shift and elongate.  In other words--it went from a star to a white cylinder shape, and then back to a star as if it was maybe rotating like a baton.  It would remain a star and only occasionally switch to the cylinder only a few times (3x).  A couple times it completely disappeared, then would reappear in the same place.  It moved very slowly to the center of the sky at a barely legible speed over the course of 15 minutes, and then completely disappeared.  My class was excited and freaking out to each other.  None of them were scared whatsoever, and in fact seemed very elated.  There was no noise detected from the object, although we cannot hear jets at that altitude either..

I first told it that we are peaceful, and that we would like to see it do something.  It quickly blinked very rapidly and brightly after that. Seconds later, the craft that earlier disappeaed came back.  It flew close to the ground in a zig-zag pattern.  Soon after it once more vanished completely.  After that, it went back to flashing and morphing around.  I asked it to make a sound, I then heard a noise that sounded like a repetitive \"bloop bloop.\"  It stopped after I noticed a light floating behind a nearby tree.  At one point it peeked out and flashed a light at me that seemed to resemble the flash on a camera.  At this time the other three witnesses had left.  I had left when I started to hear a loud ringing noise in multiple directions.   Out of curiosity, I came back a few minutes later and the main craft was completely gone.",

I don't really know how far away it was other than the fact that it went behind a large tree that was about 30 feet away.  The apparent size was similar to my pinky nail with my arm outstretched.

I sleep outside sometimes due to the fact I don't have air conditioner, and the last two days were 100+ degrees.   Before I report what we saw, approximately twenty minutes prior to the sighting we saw a bright white light circular object moving eastward at a constant speed.  The object was moving at a typical helicopter altitude without any sound.  We watched the object for approximately two minutes as it moved perpendicular to us.  Then the light began to fade and dim out completely.   Now, approximately twenty minutes after this moment, my girlfriend and I saw an orange fireball light approaching us from the north, which the object was headed for us.  Initially, it seemed to be miles away, so I grabbed my binoculars while my girlfriend continued to watch the object.  She said she saw a white spot light beneath the object and the object was spinning horizontally and that it transformed into an orb.  I returned wi! th my binoculars to see the object and it was extremely dim, and then I spotted it for one second as it moved behind a douglas fir tree.  It is difficult to explain what I saw, but I'll give my best effort. The object seemed to be a 50 to 100 yards above the ground and perhaps 100 to 200 yards in distance from me.  It was oval shaped but all I could make out was what seemed to be dark orange colored beams , approximately eight of them that were evenly spaced around the object for structure; like a house frame.

My room window faced out towards the south east of town with great views from the large room windows in the hotel. Around 2137, lasting for nearly 7-10 mins in total before they slowly floated up into the sky and disappeared. I looked out into the nights sky and over the foothills south of town, I noticed several objects in the sky that were much brighter than the stars and far too close to be a satellite or aircraft.  These objects simply sat there looking like they were floating in a way.  They could be described as looking like large fireball like items in the sky.  There were 6 of them all aligned evenly across the nights sky.  Then, 1 of them slowly started moving away by going up  Into The Nights Sky Slowly,  To All Of A sudden it would just disappear out of nowhere.  This happened until there were only two left. The strange thing was a Blackhawk police helicopter all a sudden took off from downtown and flew right near the objects where it stayed for a min then turned around and came right back downtown.  Shortly after the helicopter arrived back downtown there was all of a sudden out of nowhere a 3rd light that appeared next to the other two lights still hovering there and it literally appeared out of nowhere in the nights sky. I was able to get these objects on film and to this day I still have no clue what those objects were, but I do know one thing after seeing the way they moved and could disappear and reappear out of nowhere they were not of human origin.  These objects look very similar to some other ufo sighting I researched online which seems to be a pattern of this from of sighting.",

      "story": "Bright orange flickering object observed for 90 seconds flying North to South over Portland, Oregon. I observed a very strange flying object on July 5th at 1235am (I was so awe struck by the encounter, I immediately noted the time) over Portland, Oregon.  The object appeared to be heading in a general North to South direction and it followed, as far as I can tell, a linear path.  I originally took note of it because it was very bright.  The light was orange in color, looking like a planet might in the early evening sky, though it was even brighter and was about twice the size of what a planet would look like.  The light flickered.   I first spotted it at about 30 degrees above the Northern horizon.  I thought it was odd because it was so bright.  At first I wondered why a plane or helicopter would have such a bright orange light on at that altitude.  I live close to a level 1 trauma center so at first I thought that it might be a life flight helicopter flying to the hospital.  I\u2019ve seen them with their landing/illumination lights on and they can be quite bright.  I couldn't hear a sound and I never did.  I continued to watch it, trying to figure out what it was.  As it got closer, I thought I could see a red navigation light.   However, as the object moved overhead and to the west of me, the red light that I thought was a navigation light appeared to actually be a red shaft of light extending downwards from the bottom of the glowing object. I thought this was really odd.  I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.  It was strange enough to get the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. After the object had passed over my head (maximum height was about 75 degrees), at which point the object was very bright, the object rapidly began to get fainter and fainter until it looked similar to what a satellite would look like flying across the night sky.  Then it faded out and disappeared 35-40 degrees above the Southern horizon.  Total time of the viewing was between 60-90 seconds.   It was by far the most bizarre thing I have ever seen and I can't for the life of me figure out what it was or even surmise what it may have been.  Although I was positive what I had seen was not the ISS, just to check I looked up if the space station was going to make a pass over Portland that night, and I discovered it would be visible over Portland at 4:38am\u2014almost 4 hours after my sighting.  I have seen the ISS a number of times and this was much brighter.   I can't for the life of me figure out what it was.",

      "story": "Color changing, silent, slow moving oval above Portland's West Hills. I woke up because my cat was meowing at the window. I told her to be quiet, but she just kept on meowing, so I opened my eyes. I looked out of my window to see what the cat was meowing at thinking it must be a box elder bug on the glass or something, but instead I saw a big green oval of light. I live in a high rise building and can see Council Crest and the eastern side of West Hills from my apartment.  I can make out the houses and features of this part of West Hills well.  I could see a big green oval of light in the sky.  It seemed to be moving slower than a plane or helicopter, and seemed to be silent.  I put on my glasses so I could see it better out of curiosity and when I realized it wasn\u2019t a plane or helicopter, I ran out of bed over to the window to get a better look. I saw the oval move towards West Hills.  Then it slowly went over the hill and then I couldn\u2019t see it anymore.  The whole time it was floating around, it was gradually changing color from green to orange-red and back to green, with the color change seemingly starting towards the bottom right of the oval, and then sweeping over the rest of the oval until the thing had mostly turned orange-red. I don't know if the oval was solid or just light, but it seemed to have very clearly defined edges.  It was not like spot lights at all, which kind of have fuzzy, soft edges. I know the oval was not a plane because planes are not oval shaped and they move faster.  I see planes all the time from my windows, sometimes even antique ones, but this was not plane shaped and did not make any sound like a plane.  I know the green oval was not a helicopter because I see helicopters a lot, too, and they are noisy and I can clearly make out the helicopter shape.  In fact, I saw a helicopter come from the SW part of Portland towards the center of Portland a few minutes after I saw the green oval. I know this wasn\u2019t a car on the streets of West Hills because I could clearly see the oval in the middle of the sky at first.  And I don\u2019t think it was a drone because it looked to be wider than the houses it was above in West Hills when it was above them.  I thought for a second that it might be the aerial tram, which I can see a little bit from my place, but the aerial tram doesn\u2019t change colors, it is not green and it doesn\u2019t float around in the middle of the sky, obviously.  I don\u2019t even think that tram runs at 12:30AM. I know the oval wasn\u2019t making noise because I can clearly hear planes and helicopters from my apartment.  Also, even though this green oval floated really close to the houses on West Hills, nobody\u2019s lights went on like they heard a loud noise above their house.  I had my window cracked and could hear the helicopter a few minutes later, so I know that the noise would have definitely have come through if there were any. I tried to take a picture of the oval but my hands were shaking and I kept dropping my phone because I was a little nervous about the green thing in the sky, not knowing what is was and all, and I was trying to make my cat stop meowing by petting her at the same time.  By the time I got my phone camera ready, the thing had floated over the West Hills and out of my sight.  I don\u2019t know what the green oval thing was, so I am hoping maybe someone else does and can tell me.  I could draw a picture of it if that would help identify it.",

      "story": "New Years Light Event at Portland International Airport. Early morning (from approx 12:45am -1:45am intermittently) New Years Day, 2017, I witnessed an unexplainable series of light events, in the sky of NE Portland, Oregon. And then, something on the tarmac of the Portland International Airport. This all began at approx 12:45am. I was standing on the sidewalk with a friend, in a cul de sac on NE 14th Place, near Killingsworth St. There was a set of 2 & 3 story houses and store type buildings immediately to the North of us, and while my friend and I were chatting and wrapping up a social evening for New Years. Notably, it was a very low key night, my friend doesn\u2019t drink, and I\u2019d had just one light beer, well before midnite\u2026 So, as we were chatting, and I was about to get into my car and head home, we noticed that a very odd light had been emanating intermittently, in approx 20-30 second sustained pulse outputs, from well behind the buildings to our North\u2026but spraying the sky with light over us. We also noticed a distant \u201cbzzzzzz bzzzzzz bzzzzzz\u201d electrical energy sound that accompanied the sustained light bursts. At first, I didn\u2019t think much of the light flashes.  Neither of us did apparently, because we continued talking through the first 2 or 3 of them\u2026  Additionally to note: it had been very cold those few days.  And I believe that high winds/heavy rains had been in the forecast.  I don\u2019t remember the specifics at this time of the forecast that night\u2026  But I do recall, that the conditions were that which can lead to the occasional power surge/exploding transformer, because I remember power outages due to the weather of the night, being a concern in general\u2026 along with fallen trees and such. My friend who was a former electrical engineer with Intel, years prior to this time, and who was now a leading advisor/consultant on state and federal energy efficiency for government agencies, began to find the situation as odd as I did. We agreed to move ourselves quickly, a few hundred feet, to the end of the street to see if we could catch a better view of these lights, in what would next be, the fifth or sixth 30 second sustained pulse of light and sound\u2026  Another odd aspect of this \u201clight show\u201d was that the lights that were constant for the 20-30secs, yet pulsing in intensity, and sometimes \u201cbeaming\u201d in a broad spray of faintly focused beams \u2014they were also changing faint colors during the burst, pulsing reds, greens, blues\u2026 all of this detail happened faintly, but distinctly enough to be recognizable as separate colors\u2026 these bursts and broad beams were also fanning out of the north east direction to our location\u2026 from where we were located, and my guessing/calculations of the height of the light and the brightness, combined with my lifelong familiarity of the area\u2026 led me to estimate, that if I had to make a guess of the origin point, I would estimate that the light was coming from somewhere between us, and the Portland International Airport. My friend recognizing the lateness and his lesser curiosity to find the source \u2014agreed that the whole event was very odd, but that he was calling it a night.  I told him that I was going to investigate this further on my way home\u2026 that I would watch the sky, head into the direction that I believed the lights might be originating from, and see what I could find. I didn\u2019t know of any power station between us and the airport, but I was accepting of the idea that possibly there was one, and that maybe they were having some massive power surges at a local power station, and these sustained 20-30 second bursts of light and buzzing sounds of electrical energy, might be coming from something like that. Of course he said to \u201ctext\u201d him, if I found anything. By approx. 1:15am, I had driven Northward through NE Portland, watching the sky and seeing nothing further\u2026 until I driven approx 4 miles by road (probably less than 2 miles as the crow flies) to a location along the Columbia River, parking myself at a high vantage point at the M. James Gleason Memorial Boat Ramp, which is situated and Western most point of the Portland International Airport\u2026  I sat there with my eyes intently scanning the horizon, looking back in the direction of NE Portland from where I\u2019d just come\u2026 seeing if the event would occur again, back in that direction, or if it were to occur again, would it now be behind me further to the North?  Or what?  I texted my friend, told him where I was parked\u2026 and that I\u2019d seen nothing yet. If anything changed, I\u2019d let him know in the morning.  (He was not a late night guy really, so I wanted to check-in and alleviate any concerns he might have for me, still being out\u2026)   Then, at approximately 1:40am \u2014a brilliant green burst of light flashed on what I estimated to be Rocky Butte.  Which is basically one of a half dozen elevated hilltop/mounds around the Portland area.  These small hills resemble Lava Cones in Central Oregon\u2026  They might be big enough to top out 400-600 ft above the average ground level around Portland, and they might host 50-100 homes and acres on them, give or take\u2026  My point being, these large ground mounds are elevated enough, that from my vantage point, Rocky Butte was positioned just South Easterly, approx 3-4 miles (as the crow flies) from my location, and I was looking almost directly OVER the Portland Airport, at this new light burst, mid way up Rocky Butte\u2026  Now, I\u2019m no expert on exploding transformers, but THIS event, was much more like what I would have expected an exploding transformer to be, as I had seen an alleged transformer explode once or twice in my past, and seen the light in the sky, followed by a power outage\u2026  But this was in stark contrast to what we had seen earlier.  This particular burst as I said, was bright green.  It was a flash of bright light, similar to looking at an arc welder (which I know you shouldn\u2019t look at) but my point is that it had a distinct light source at it\u2019s core that was very bright (like an explosion) and it was strong flash of green light, maybe lasting as much as five seconds\u2026but definitely not longer. This light event did NOT seem extraordinary, BUT, it made me feel like my waiting had paid off, as I had been sitting there almost 30min waiting for SOMETHING to happen\u2026  But this felt like a more mundane event, than what we had witnessed earlier. I decided to wait another 5 mins and see what might happen. Then just a few mins later \u2014\u2014\u2014 wow.  Just wow. I\u2019d like to note here, Portland International Airport is home to an Air National Guard squadron (my father flew F102\u2019s out of that base in the 60\u2019s), and it\u2019s also home to some of the top US Air Force Pararescuemen and Combat Controllers in the country.  I had spent a few years working in the special operations community and I had the honor of working with these local guys a little bit over the years, and becoming familiar with the base itself. The next \u201clight event\u201d occurred what I estimated at the time, right outside the hangars of the USANG area\u2026 granted I was probably at least a mile away, but what I saw was incredible!  A VERY bright green light began to emanate from this point on the base, it got brighter and bigger and sustained itself between approximately 60-75 seconds, an eternity it felt at the time!  This light had something of green diamond shape to it\u2019s light formation when it had reached full intensity after about 10-15 seconds\u2026  I could not believe my eyes\u2026 I was running through rational explanations in my head: \u201cit's not an explosion, because it\u2019s sustaining itself\u2026 it\u2019s not some search light\u2026because\u2026I\u2019ve never seen ANYTHING like it, and it\u2019s just emanating light, it\u2019s not searching or moving!\u201d  And then, after approx 60-75 seconds\u2026 a green beam of light shot straight up into the sky! like a laser\u2026  I can\u2019t explain it, beyond associating it to something you see in the movies\u2026 after a few seconds of this sustained green laser beam, directed straight up, I don\u2019t know how far\u2026 the burst flashed OUT with an intensity that I can\u2019t really describe.  But when it flashed OFF, it created a ripple of light that rippled southward from there, like an EMP (electro magnetic pulse) wave, that I could see ripple in the sky to the south, OVER the clouds (or through the clouds I guess???) the sky was full of reasonably heavy cloud cover that was present everywhere in the sky\u2026 as I had said earlier, it had been heavily raining and very windy that night. After the burst, it was business as usual in the area.  Airport lights were all on. Nothing seemed amiss.  There was NO ACTIVITY in the area of the event\u2026\u2026. So I decided to wait a few minutes and see if there would be a response on the tarmac, on the base side of the PDX Airport\u2026  I waited a good 5-6mins patiently, for the show.  The response to this. Nothing came.  There was not any sight of activity or change in the area, from my mile away vantage point.  So \u2014 I decided to go closer and investigate. I began the drive around the airport, on the back road to Columbia Blvd, and down the back streets, the back way to the gates of the base\u2026  All the while, keeping my eyes open to the sky for more lights, and keeping my eyes out for any emergency response vehicles\u2026  When I had covered the approx 3 mile drive around to the base, which took maybe\u202610mins? I found nothing going on there. No vehicles moving on base.  No excess of cars parked inside the fence line, as if excessive amounts of personnel were on duty that weekend\u2026 in fact there was not even any increase in visible gate security. I was very confused. I drove on around the outside of the fence line on the street that parallels the base and passes the entry points to the base, which also has access to the airport tarmac\u2026 I drove to a point where I had triangulated my sight line, to where I believed the event had occurred, in relation to specific buildings/hangars and flood light sources on site\u2026  I parked along the gate and got out of my vehicle and stood there a moment. It was silent.  It was nearly 2am on New Years Day, and there was nothing happening there at all. I couldn\u2019t believe no one was there supervising whatever it was.  Or responding to it. I then drove on around the base, to another vantage point on 82nd Ave, which is a public street that feeds traffic to the Portland airport\u2026  I pulled into the gravel on the side of the road, at a position which would now place me just East of where whatever I saw happen, happened\u2026  I looked everywhere, and i saw nothing\u2026  By now, maybe 15min had passed, since the described event. I look directly up.  And I notice a HUGE circular opening in the clouds over the airport. All of the clouds above the airport were gone.  I could see the stars.  And it was like a giant circle had been cut out of the clouds\u2026 maybe a mile across?  Maybe more\u2026  But the sky over the airport was now completely clear. I can\u2019t explain any of it further than I have. I went home.",

      "story": "There are sightings of three lights, seen at different times. I saw three UFO's last night, 12/9/2017 (early morning actually).  I am not sure what time it was when we saw the first two.  What I observed was a bright light, North of our house moving West to East.  At first, I thought it might have been the International Space Station (ISS).  I opened our front door and ask my girlfriend's daughter to come out.  I was in the doorway for 45 sec. to a minute.  She came out and the first UFO had vanished and I thought I should still have been able to see it.  When I looked again, in about the same position in the sky, there was another bright light moving at about the same speed, altitude, etc.  We watched it for a few seconds and it disappeared.  The two UFO's had been reflecting light from over the horizon and when they entered the Earth's shadow they could no longer be seen.  They had no lights on them. I was out on the front porch  a few hours later about 5:30 a.m.  The view from the porch is mostly to the North and East.  I looked up at the Moon and saw what I thought was a bright large planet close to the Moon's position, then I noticed the object was moving from South to North.  Again, my first thought was that it was a satellite.  I watched it for about 15 to 20 seconds and all of the sudden, it shot off, at a mind boggling speed, to the Southwest at about a 300 to 310 degree angle from the direction that it had been moving.  I had one of those \"Wow!!\" moments.  It disappeared quickly.  After it made the turn, I only saw it for maybe two seconds.  I think it had been reflecting light from the Moon and just disappeared into shadow as it changed direction.",

We left the house at approx 5:45 and began our walk.  We noticed two glowing objects in the sky, seemingly different from anything else we could see.  Immediately I took out my phone and starting recording.  The orbs appeared red/orange in color but were also flickering throughout the sighting.  Moving between orange, red and at times a slight yellow.  As we started to move towards the two objects we were able to see a third.  All three sat there but then the started to move a little.  The one on the left began to move quickly to the left while the middle one stayed stationary.  Eventually the one on the right seemed to \"blip\" out.  We chased the one moving to the left and by the time we saw it again the other two were gone.  After deciding to try and get a better vantage point we ran around and eventually lost sight of the objects. I stood quietly and attempted to reach out mentally.  I remember saying, \"Show yourself to me one more time so I know I'm not seeing things.\"  Shortly there after (approx two minutes) objects appeared in the sky again.  This time there was only two. We ran down streets trying to get better views of them.  During this time we observed the objects hovering, moving in a straight line, changing course during flight and eventually moving out of sight.  Overall the entire incident lasted about 15 mins before we lost sight or they disappeared.  Both of us were deeply impacted, myself particularly so. We also took a fair amount of video which I have uploaded to YouTube.  Here is a link to the main video with all footage edited together. I also included unedited raw footage in seven different clips, all available on the account.

Within a minute or so it got very loud and the windows started to rattle.  It was obviously a military helicopter flying low.  We have experienced this on occasion, but never have the windows rattled like this instance. My husband and I looked at each other, jumped up and ran outside, looking north.  It was a clear night and an almost full moon, which was in the eastern sky.  What made this encounter interesting enough to report was not just the helicopter.   We are somewhat in the flight path of PDX and have planes flying over, so I know how fast they go.  When we went out, the helicopter was just flying over our house in a NNW direction.  In front of it, also flying NNW, was a small bright white light -- low on the horizon and flying VERY fast.  No sound could be heard other than the helicopter. Interestingly, there were two airplanes flying south higher then the light and the helicopter.  They had typical airplane lights and followed the normal flight pattern we usually see from planes flying over. Again, what was noteworthy about this experience was the speed and low altitude at which the white light was traveling, plus the military helicopter following it (I don't know if I would say pursuing it).  I don't know if the light was ET, but we would definitely call it a UFO because of the nature of the encounter.  Maybe something military?",

      "story": "A group of adults witness two lights, moving rapidly overhead, which quickly swap positions. At approximately 10:30 PM Eastern Standard Time (3:30 AM UTC) two fast-moving objects were spotted in the sky directly above Portland, Maine.  The two objects initially followed identical linear trajectories through the night sky, separated by about 5 degrees of arc, coming into sight directly overhead.   The two lights were point-source, with brightness similar to a dim star.  At an incredibly high altitude, the fast-movers paralleled each other with great velocity \u2013 much faster than any satellite could travel while still maintaining orbit, and much faster than any known commercial or military aircraft.   Around 4 to 5 seconds after visual contact was established, the two objects immediately jutted to the left and to the right to cross paths with each other moments later.  The movement was seemingly impossible and violated laws of conservation of momentum, as an extremely large external force must\u2019ve been present in order to move them in such a way.  After crossing! paths, the two objects returned to their original distance of separation and, with the same seemingly-impossible course correction, returned to their linear trajectories.  Two other witnesses and myself maintained visual contact until light pollution from the nearby city of Portland caused us to lose contact.

He was ahead of me and turned around to talk to me and something caught his eye over my right shoulder. I turned to look and I saw five lights (4 white lights and 1 red light) in the air flying directly over the houses on my street. These five lights were in (what I am going to call) a formation that suggested they should have been attached to a passenger airplane.  The lights came from the east and flew low over the houses on my street. They were very close to me but there was no sound and I could tell that they were not coming from a commercially available drone, or any other drone-device that I know of. The space between the lights, in which I would have expected to see the body of an airplane, was empty. There was no visible structure holding these lights in their relative formation. I could see the sky and mountains behind them.  The lights flew past me from east to west and then turned in unison toward the northwest and flew over another city before disappearing into the distance. When I finally looked at my boyfriend to get his reaction, he was just staring at the spot the lights disappeared. I asked him \u201cDid you see what I saw?\u201d and he responded by saying, \u201cWhere was the plane?\u201d  At that point we talked about what he both saw and agreed that we saw the same thing. We agreed that for lack of a better explanation, we had seen an invisible passenger airplane, or something pretending to be one.

      "story": "hovering saucer with colored lights flew and stopped twice suddenly,  changed to a silver gray muted appearance in the distance This is what I reported on mufon in 1988:  Long Description of Sighting Report I was walking upstairs and looked out a large window where the stairs turned at the halfway point.  I saw a multi color lighted saucer shaped thing hovering silently just 10-15 feet away. It was no more than 1.5 feet in diameter.  I thought someoneone had a neat remote controlled flying saucer.  I watched it when suddenly it flew away at a high rate of speed, faster than what seemed possible.  I remember watching it fly several several blocks thinking that where I perceived it to be, at this distance, I shouldn't be able to see it anymore. It also may have appeared grey at this distance.  Then it was gone. I sat there thinking did this just happen? What was this?  The moment was gone, and I wished I could have it back, it was just too strange. I still think about this today.  In reading my above description in 2019 I think it may have been up to 3 feet in diameter.  It had colored lights, it was hovering near the ground, so I was looking down it.  From this position it flew several houses up the street and stopped suddenly still displaying lights.  It then flew to another position further away, again stopped suddenly and at this time it appeared a dull silver gray.  It then darted off in yet another direction and was gone. I think it would be helpful if common features of sightings could be compiled; How many changed colors or lost color?  Sudden stops in the sky? sharp turns?  Size?  How many were as small as mine?",
