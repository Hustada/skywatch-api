In short this was seen by myself and and a local news reporter also.I saw this from a third floor deck in the 37221 zip looking over percy warner park towards green hills ,it looked like it was over the Green hills area which is another zip code but not far.Late in the summer of 07 not sure of exact date,but looked like a white globe with green to light green smoke or mist?? coming off the back end of it.I might have been 4 to 10 miles away, but at that distance a plane normally looks a third of the size of what I saw.I have never seen things that were not there,don't hear stuff either. I was not with the news guy when I saw this, but my friend who knows him said he saw the same thing a week or so later.This thing came in fast and then I could not see it any more. No impact was reported and I am sure more people saw it than us two.I have a couple of degrees and a carry permit they don't give those to crazy people,This was too big to make it that close to the ground without breaking up first and no impact was reported.I'm very far from stupid,and have seen many shooting stars etc etc.This was quite different...That's all I got.

Flying through the sky at a very slow rate of speed was what appeared to be a green stream of light that was moving in a manner that made it seem alive and not a craft. It was flying no more than 20-30 feet above me due east for approximately 30-40 seconds when a spark of light materialised at the head of the stream and seemed to reveal a vague ring shape with bright white flamelike sparks of light emanating from inside the outer portion of the ring towards the center and right before the sparks met in the middle the whole thing dissapeared. The object made no sound which was strange to me as it was flying so low. The movement of the object was fluid and slightly undulating which the only way I could make a rational human comparison when I told my wife was that it moved and had a vague physical resemblance to a jellyfish. I have never seen anything like it nor have I ever heard or read of anything like it but since it happened I have found similar sightings reported online.  This was not a firework, or any light abberation or distortion. It was vivid, close and highly visible with more than enough time for me to size it up and find a logical explanation. I would like to know if anyone else saw it that night. I have never seen a ufo and am a rational intelligent person who has never ruled out the possibility of life beyond this world but at the same time never convinced by the limited knowledge of reported sightings and lack of first hand evidence.

On the date and time specified I saw a black balloon floating high in the sky as I sat on my balcony at my apartment complex.  It was a hot July evening.  I noticed the \"balloon\" and stood up to look at it.  I thought of a contest we had in Sunday school as a child in which we were all given helium ballons to tie our names and phone numbers to so that if our balloon was found we would receive a call from whomever found it.  The one found from the farthest place was the winner. Suddenly the balloon shifted into a horizontal shape and I could see what appeared to be heat waves like you see when you look down a road on a hot day. This balloon morphed back and forth from vertical balloon shape to horizontal oblong shape a few times as it moved lower in the sky and began to pass over my apartment.  I ran through my apartment to the front door.  When I emerged from the apartment the balloon was just above my apartment. It passed over me at that height and then a slit opened and a red light flashed and the slit closed.  It continued along over the next hill and morphed a few more times.  It made no sound whatsoever.  I don't know what I saw.  If you know please tell me. I have since seen a video clip of a similar thing from Bristol Va. a few days later in August of that year.",

My fianc\u00e9 was driving me home after she had gotten off work when I noticed a large bright object in the sky.  We had just passed smith springs road were it intersects with murfresboro road driving away from downtown Nashville.  I was in the passenger seat and saw it to the left and in front of the car. At first I thought I was looking at a helicopter as the object seemed to hover.  But, as we drove closer I could see that the object was long and flat on the bottom and far to large to be a helicopter. Once we made it to our turn at nashboro blv, we could see the object quite clearly and noticed that it had begun to move slowly.  Once we turned from murfresboro on to nashboro blv., the object passed over our car slowly and making no noise at all.  The object was low enough that if I had been on the roof of a nearby house I could almost have touched it.  After it passed over our car we watched it descend into a near by field. We drove around trying to get a better view of where it had landed but were unable to see more then a bright glow from the road.  Neither of us were willing to get out of the car and trek through unknown fields to find it so we drove around hoping we could get a better view.  After about 10 minutes of driving up both smith springs and nashboro blv we saw the craft shoot back into the sky at a steep angle.  After it took off we followed it until the object turned around and a plane passed over us a few seconds later. We made a u-turn at bell road back onto smith springs to follow both the plane and the object. We lost sight of the plane and never saw it again but we did find the object again flying low and parallel to murfresboro road.  We followed it down murfresboro till it came to a halt in the air and then a few moments later it turned and headed back the other way towards nashboro blv again.  Making another u-turn we followed the object turning off murfresboro and back onto nashboro blv. There it traveled straight down nashboro blv and I snapped a few pictures while driving after it. After about 3 minutes the object turned sharply around an came over our car once again.  It was silent and fast and quickly was out of sight seeming to descend again. After this we lost sight of the object and were unable to find it again.",

      "story": "Alien Encounter in Tennessee Peter, this is B J Booth, webmaster of UFO Casebook, and guide at about.com UFOs and Alien site.   I am sending this on behalf of a witness, who works for a law firm in Tennessee, and relates an alien encounter.  I am including her contact phone number in the appropiate section. Alien Encounter - Alien Encountered in Cheatham County, TN  I reside in Cheatham County, Tennessee, and observed an alien in my yard in February this year. The reason I am coming forward is because the description the woman in Georgia provided of the 3 alien beings she observed at a campsite where she and her husband were camping the latter part of 2009 is almost exactly the same as what I saw. It was approximately 5:00 in the morning.  There was still snow on the ground from the last snow.  I had gotten ready for work and was sitting in my Suzuki in the drive letting it warm up before leaving for my job in Nashville, Tennessee. I caught movement out of the corner of my eye in the area of my garage (which is used for storage and not to pull a car into).  At first, I thought it was one of the neighbor's dogs. I turned to look and saw something which very closely matched the description of the alien creatures which the woman in Georgia observed. Its body, extra long arms and hind legs were so thin.  Its head was very large and bumpy. It was pale in color and hairless. It was very cold outside, and the creature appeared a light grayish color (I'm not sure whether the cold temperature would have affected the appearance of the color). The only difference in my story and hers is that the 3 creatures she saw were upright.  This was moving on all 4's, however, the way it was moving made it appear like a monkey or gorilla that are oftentimes upright, but then use their arms in conjunction with their legs to propel themselves forward. On all 4's, it was about the height of a large dog, and I observed that it would be considered short, compared to most humans, if it stood upright. Its legs were short, quite a bit stockier than the body and arms, which were long and skinny. It kept looking back as though it thought it was being followed, and so it was surprised to see me sitting inside the automobile when it looked around, directly at me, for the first time. I got a good look at its large, round eyes which were darkish in color.  They appeared a dark brown.  It was as though it sensed I wasn't going to hurt it, and it continued on across my yard, across the road, and continued out a connecting road which is directly in front of my home. There are lots of wooded areas in the direction it was traveling, and lots of wooded area behind my home. I am not comfortable just ignoring this occurrence. Questions are racing through my mind - questions which need to be answered. What are these creatures doing in our wooded areas, hiding out by day and wandering by night?  Where did they come from?  Are they depleting any of our resources?  Will they become dangerous if someone acts aggressively toward them?  (I was so busy looking at its eyes and bumpy head that I cannot describe a nose and/or mouth.)  I am a sane individual who is employed at one of Nashville's most prominent law firms.

Lights circling inside clouds over Nashville  My wife and I were driving on I-40 westbound on Sunday night, coming back to Nashville from east Tennessee. After passing the Lebanon exit, I began noticing lights moving inside the clouds closer to Nashville. As we got closer, I could tell that they looked like spot lights shining down from above or inside the clouds instead of from below, and they were moving in large circles. This night we saw two of them moving in large circles and figure eights from east to west over Nashville. One of the main reasons I became so interested was that my wife and I have seen similar lights before. I filed a report back in 8/03 about lights we saw clrcling around inside the clouds during a big thunderstorm. We had pretty much conviced ourselves that this earlier sighting was a spotlight promoting something, or maybe lights from the Starwood Ampitheater, which we're kind of near (although I don't know why anyone would have continued to shine these types of lights during one of the biggest thunderstorms of the summer). These lights looked almost exactly the same and were moving in almost the same fashion, except there were only two instead of four. So now we had a chance to try to find the source of these lights and prove to ourselves that we weren't seeing anything out of the ordinary. We closed in on the city from about 30 miles out and the lights became increasingly obvious. I'm sure other cars must have seen them, but there's no way to know. I had slowed down a lot because I was fascinated by these lights clrcling and seemingly swooping around just above the cloud ceiling. We kept expecting one to become more visible or distinct though a break in the clouds, but it never happened. They stayed very fuzzy and shapeless. The lights would circle opposite each other, then move together and back apart or do some crazy zig zag. However, we never saw a beam of light from the ground, and that was primarily what we were looking for. We got off the interstate on Stewarts Ferry Pk., when we thought we were finally getting below the lights, and went east. I was driving, but my wife could still see them northeast of us, so I took a left on Lebanon Pk and went north. Now we were very close to the Nashville airport, but the general movement of the lights seemed to be to the northwest and we could never get under them. We were also getting around more city lights and it was harder to see them, and they seemed to be farther away from us. We were tired from our drive so we went on home, but we satisfied ourselves that these lights were not originating from spotlights on the ground. I don't know that it proves anything about the first lights we saw, but it makes me wonder. I know other people must have seen these lights, as they were all over above the city, so I'm hoping someone else will come forward. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I SEEN 4/16/09 (of which I posted here) I feel so much better knowing someone seen the same thing 5 years eariler.  The cloud thing is interesting though.. It was like they not want to go beneath the cloud cover, but I could see them clearly once they connected together in the cloud clearing. The cloud thing is strange, it was between walmart and kroger on the busiest street in Nashville, near a communication tower... odd and very strange... I have calmed down a little since then but I cannot enter my apartment without thinking about what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

      "story": "Blurry blob of light streaking through sky above a cloud Last night I was outside at approximately 23:30.  I was on the west side of my house between my house and my neighbor\u2019s house.  I was walking northward towards my back yard.  There were a few low clouds that were mostly transparent.  I saw a streak of light traveling from east to west above one of the clouds.  Because I saw it through the cloud, it was kind of blurry.  It was traveling very fast, and it only lasted a few seconds before it flew out of site behind my neighbor\u2019s house.  My first thought is that it was a meteor.  However, I watched a meteor shower several weeks ago, and this \u201cstreak\u201d traveled a longer distance than the meteors I\u2019ve seen.  It was also traveling the opposite direction of the meteors I saw a few weeks ago.  (I admit that I don\u2019t know much about meteors, and I assume they can travel in any direction.)  However, this streak didn\u2019t look as long as the meteors I saw and it lasted longer.  My next thought is that it was a spotlight, but! I searched the horizons, and I didn\u2019t see any spotlights shining up and moving around.  My last explanation was that it could have been some light refracting through the corner of my glasses lenses, and it created some sort of optical illusion.  However, there were no cars driving by or any other moving source of light that could have caused that.  Also, since I\u2019ve worn glasses for years, I can say that I have never experienced an optical illusion of a light in a cloud due to refracted light though my glasses.  It was too fast to be a plane, plus there was no noise.  It was most likely a meteor, but it didn\u2019t look or behave like the meteors I\u2019ve seen.  But I admit that may be because my sight of it was distorted though the low thin cloud.  I would say that the chances of this being some sort of ET craft is very low, but since I couldn\u2019t positively identify it, it was a mystery to me, and therefore, a UFO.  I just wanted to report it so that there would be record of it in c! ase someone else saw something, too.",

On Friday April 17, 2009 at approximately 22:36 hours a friend and I witnessed two objects in the sky over Nashville, NC. These objects flew side by side at a high rate of speed emitting no sound and leaving no vapor trail. They flew at a steady speed and at a constant distance apart from each other. There were no lights on these craft and seemed to be reflecting ambient light from the material they were made with. It resembled a semi polished aluminum or titanium. The craft flew in a North, Northeasterly direction. The speed at which the craft traveled was comparable to that of a low flying military fighter. The craft seemed to be approximately 20-25,000 feet in the air. I am no flight expert but it seemed to be at an altitude slightly higher than what a helicopter would fly. The craft appeared to be flying in a formation with one slightly ahead of the other. As stated before, these craft traveled without making a sound. I only noticed the objects because I had went outside to smoke and happened to be looking at the stars noticing what a clear night it was. The objects seemed to be round or a slight elliptical shape. This is the second time I have witnessed unidentified objects. The other sighting was approximately 17 years ago near Warrenton, VA. That sighting was confirmed by documentation with a government agency of other reports.",

On our drive home at about 8:55 p.m, we passed a cleared lookout spot on top of one of the park\u2019s hills and saw several very bright, yellow-orange lights, stationary in the sky, northeast of our location.  We parked and got out of the car immediately, and then stood in the dark watching these lights for the next four minutes approximately. The park has many of these scenic overlooks where trees have been removed and people can pull their cars off the roads and view forested hills, perhaps as far away as 15-25 miles.  Brown County is very rural and covered with forested hills.  There is no town, or towers, or any high structures in the direction of these lights.  However, Camp Atterbury, a military camp, is about 10 miles east of this location. For the next four minutes or so, we watched these lights come on, stay lit about 30 seconds or so, and then go off, fading quickly. We noticed as one light would go out, another would often come on in another location. Often, the lights seemed to be grouped in a diamond-shape pattern, but this shape changed as a light would go off. We saw as many as 5 lights at one time, and as few as one, before all of them went completely out. They appeared, at first, to be stationary, but through careful observation we noticed that lights would go slightly out of alignment with each other, suggesting very slow movement. We wondered if these lights were attached to a larger shape or form that we could not make it out. They were bright and it was getting dark. It is also hard to say how far away they were from us with any accuracy. They may have been a mile or so away. Even if they were as close as a mile away, the lights themselves would be rather large and exceedingly bright. If they were! attached to a form, it would be gigantic. They may have been have been several hundred feet in the air and were above tree line. Becasue we do not know how far away they were, it is also hard to determine how high they may have been. My wife had her iPhone and located the direction of the lights (northeast from where we stood) and zoomed in to take a picture at a time when three lights were present. My son (age 24) and I watched similar very bright, yellow-orange lights one night, in the same direction, about 2 \u00bd months ago. They also went off and on as well; there were about 10 lights or so. At that time, we heard what sounded like thunder rumbling coming from these lights. When I asked him what they looked like to him, he replied, \"They look like the lights on the front of a stereo equilizer, moving slightly in relationship to each other.\"",

The sky was clear, with a full moon illuminating the sky considerably. While looking at the moon we witnessed a very bright, solid white, orb-like object float into our field of view.  We don\u2019t know where it originated from as it seemed to have simply appeared. As we watched the light, we witnessed it accelerate fluidly and slow down just the same.  The object was able to make left, right, up, and down movements while changing altitudes quickly.  This object was totally silent, and it traversed the length of our house, but must have been at least a couple of miles away.   The light then moved behind the trees just behind our house.  Yet, being as bright as it was, we were still able to maintain visual contact and track its movement.  We were at this point standing on my neighbor\u2019s porch, my girlfriend on my right, when the object vanished.  Simultaneously, a shooting white light shot off into space faster than lightening.  The light trail was almost imperceptible to the eye, and it\u2019s duration a fraction of a second.  Almost like a reverse shooting star. At this point, we were stunned because we knew it was like nothing we had ever seen.  As we sat and discussed the object/light, we continued watching the sky. It couldn\u2019t have been mo re than 5 or ten minutes since the other object vanished when we began to see multiple high-altitude aircraft flying towards the area where the object had been.  These aircraft made no sound, and had blue and red quick flashing/blinking lights.  These lights flashed quickly and they appeared to be set in a rectangular shape or pattern.  One after another, these aircraft continued to appear at what looked like the same altitude and speed; the latter being hard to estimate.  At one point, it appeared these craft were assuming a triangular formation or were flying in a formation directly above where we witnessed the first object. I estimate seeing at least 10 of these aircraft, and I do not believe these were commercial aircraft.  I think it\u2019s possible they were military in nature, and that they also may have been circling the area.  These aircraft eventually disappeared, maintaining the same direction, speed, and altitude.",

      "story": "In October 1961, a silvery flattened disk hovered motionless over a local school fair for more than 30 minutes. I saw an unidentified flying object in the fall of 1961 or 1962. I was 11 or 12 years old at the time, and I was attending a fall fair with my parents at my elementary school.  Several hundred people were in attendance at this fair.  There were numerous rides for the kids and there were plenty of colored flashing lights all over the place.  One of my friend's dad was an amateur astronomer and had set up his telescope for people to see the moon and the planets. At some point, a UFO appeared out of nowhere.  It was a silvery flattened disk with 2 or 3 portholes on the side. It was not a shiny silver color but had a sort of dullness to it.  It remained completely motionless over the large field where the fair was in progress.  It had an oscillating glow between red and green.  I cannot recall how high the UFO was but you could see it fairly well with the naked eye.  Many people observed the UFO through the telescope.  When I looked through the telescope, I could see that it appeared to be fairly bright inside the UFO but I did not see any life or movement inside.  Some one placed a call to either the local police or to the Tennessee Air National Guard which was located just a few miles away from the school. Two (2) jets were scrambled, and you could hear them approaching very quickly.  As they approached, the UFO took off at a very oblique angle, no sound was made, and the departure was faster than you could blink your eyes. I am now 62 years old, and I have never forgotten that night.  From time to time, I have tried to find information on the internet about this incident but without success.

      "story": "Bright white light or spinning obetct A friend and I were walking around downtown Nashville for exercise about 11:45 AM Saturday April 13th when a white bag flying through the sky just caught our attention.  As we looked at it floating a thousand or so feet to the northeast, we noticed a very faint light or a white abject that had to be at least 30 thousand feet in the sky changing shapes and directions.  It would have been the size of a star or maybe the size of Venus if the stars were out, maybe a little larger as I could tell there was movement.  It was directly above and beyond the bag and very hard to see and would not have noticed it otherwise.  The object was moving in a general SE direction but would take slight jumps up down and back and forward.  The movements were not smooth and very abrupt jaunts going back in the direction it came and then seeming to stop and then move on.  The object was either spinning and a shinny side was catching the sun or there was a light flashing. We could not ! tell. We watched the object for about 5 minutes and then lost site of it as we looked away. In those five minutes it would have traveled from the 12 o clock position to the three o clock position toward the sun.  If there was sound we could not tell as we were on a busy street.  There was a slight breeze and the temperature was about 66 degrees with almost totally clear skies.  There was not vapor trail left by the object.  I was able to view the object a little better with my sun glasses on as did my friend and we both had polarized sun glasses.",

      "story": "Three white spheres separate, then connected and rotating in the afternoon. My two boys and I (ages 6 and 7) were playing baseball in the backyard when I just thought I should look up for a vague but unknown certain reason, if that makes sense.  \"Look! Parachuters!,\" I yelled, noticing two bright white spots just hanging in the sky, seeming to drift around.  The sky was a deep blue with just one large wispy feather-like cloud stretching from over our heads to the horizon.  Visibility was excellent.   One of my boys pointed out a third object.  We watched for a while as they moved further away, maybe higher, couldn't tell. I am terrible at judging heights, so I will not try to guess their altitude.  Two of them were in the same general area.  One was off to the northeast of the others.  My husband pointed out to the boys that these couldn't be parachuters because they were not coming down.   Then I decided they weren't going to vanish because they weren't darting around or just staying still like ufos are often reported to do.  I though! t they must be weather balloons. I ran inside, came back out with the binoculars and couldn't get an eye on them.  They finally got too far away to see.   I gave up, went in for water and ate a little snack, came back and there was another one, or one came back, just as low as when I first spotted them.  This time I supported my elbows on the trunk of my car and got a good look through the binoculars.  I watched this thing for about five minutes.  Maybe more.  There were three large spheres all apparently connected, and they were rotating, not like those balloon arches do that people think are space worms or whatever.  This was steady as clockwork. It was like the hand of a clock going around but the hand was made of spheres.  It did this the entire time I was watching.  For a while they were roating vertically, then turned horizontal. Its movement appeared to me to not be subject to the wind.  It was steadily sailing to the east with no variation in direction.  At one point, I don't k! now if it was the light reflecting or my eyes, but they had a ! rainbowi sh glow on the edges.  The object or objects appeared white.  They did seem to be connected. I watched until it got too small to see.",

I am an avid sky watcher and have seen satellites, military jets, \"northern lights,\" and know the difference between planets and stars, natural phenomenon, etc.   My first thought was a helicopter, though the light was different and did not throw a beam nor where there any navigational lights.  It was orange and rough in appearance, not like a sharp, well-defined light.  It looked the same color as a sodium-burning street light.   I pulled over to observe.  It traveled in a straight path.  It was not a windy evening.  It made no sound and being at low altitude ( I would estimate 500-1,000 ft.) made no sound.  Flight path was straight.  I'm not quick with the camera/phone like kids are but wanted to observe.  It was heading towar! ds the Smyrna/Mt. Juliet area and I thought it interesting a couple other similar reports earlier in the year.   I keep running over this in my head and can't figure out what it was and I'm the first to think there is a logical explanation.  The Russian Meteor happened within 12 hours of this event.

      "story": "Sighting replicated two nights in a row in West Nashville. Profile of sighting(s):  Sighting 1-  11.09.14 2200  At approximately 11pm I was out on a run here in west Nashville.  My approximate location was at the highway 100 highway 70 split.  Upon looking down at the city scape, I noticed a light that seemed to cut the sky in half the way a spot light would if it were pointed directly up into the night sky.  The stream of light was faint due to the saturation of light coming off of the city and the almost full moon.  To give you an idea of my vantage point- the at&t building is facing my direction with this stream of light appearing to disect the building in half vertically.   I looked at this stream for perhaps a minute or so as I tried to discern if it was light coming off of another building (such as a hospital) and as I was doing so a globe appeared directly over the at&t building itself - or so it seemed.  The light was circular or globe like in shape and it emitted a red and orange pulsating light.  The light I saw was akin to tossing red and orange glow in the dark balls into a circular tumbler and then revolving the tumbler in a fashion similar to the way a drying machine might tumble clothing around.  The light I saw had an extremely unusual characteristic to it.  The light appeared to strobe, yet it was faint enough that I didn't get the impression I was on the dance floor or having a laser pointed at me.  The light lasted approximately 2 minutes and was 4-5 times the size of the at&t logo itself.   After a couple of minutes the intensity of the light decreased -as did the frequency of strobes.  The light then moved in a south/east path over the city and out towards Memphis if you were headed on I 40.  The velocity was\"slow\" yet constant (similar to that of an airplane cruising at altitude)  with no apparent change in trajectory or pitch.  The light continued to move horizontally across my field of vision until it went behind a tree line and into the night.  No jet stream or sound observed. Sighting 2 -  11.10.14 2200  In an effort to gather some additional information about the sighting - I decided to head out at the same time and be at the same place as I originally saw the object.  I didn't think that I would be able to replicate my experience, but fortunately I was able to gather some extremely important observational data that may help in identifying what it is I originally saw.  Again at 2200 the night after my initial sighting I saw this object but this time it was different. At this point the object flew into my line of sight as if it came from Memphis into Nashville.  The object exhibited the same behavior as the object I saw last night during it's exiting phase. I saw it fly in a constant velocity and altitude as it did the night before. This time however - the object stopped in mid air just outside the city and hung there for approximately 30 seconds. Then it proceeded to head out the way it came without any sign that the object actually turned around mid flight.  Essentially it w! as like the object was attached to a tether (like that of a yo-yo approaching the ground- appearing to stop for a second- and then going right back towards it's initial point of entry into my vantage point)  The entire sighting lasted approximately 6 minutes.  2 min entry. 1 min \"stationary.\" 2min departure towards initial point of entry.  This is the third time that I have witnessed this object - earlier in the summer I saw the same thing as my inititial report above but I didn't record it on my phone.  I have footage from the Nov. 9 sighting but unfortunately I gave up my personal information in the video.  Que the X-files track!",

      "story": "Two fireballs hovering over I-65  near the exit to the old Saturn Plant outside of columbia TN My son and I had been hunting today on some family land in middle Tennessee.  On our way home on I-65 around the exit that leads to the old Saturn plant, we saw two lights in the sky.  I have an Aerospace degree and make a living in technology and design which puts me in some interesting experiences.  I am naturally visual spatial and am usually very aware of my surroundings and notice a lot of details.   We drove for about 4 miles from the time that I first noticed the lights before finally stopping on the side of the interstate to watch them almost directly overhead.  At first the two lights were in close proximity to each other and seemed to rotate slowly at about a 20 degree angle from horizontal as we were initially driving along.  I say that it looked that way but of course from our vantage point in a moving vehicle it can look like rotation but not actually be that. the most interesting thing was what we saw when we came to a stop and rolled the windows down.  The two lights were at about 1000 feet altitude from our position.  We had an overcast sky with a ceiling of about 1200 to 1500 feet I guess without checking.   These two objects seemed from my vantage point to be about as large as a car each in size judging from the size of the light they were emitting. initially from the first view we had of them, they seemed to alternate between brighter and darker in the intensity of their light which initially led me to believe that they were two airplanes that were in a holding pattern waiting for their turn at final approach into Nashville airport.  I knew that air traffic control would not have placed two planes this close together so I figured that they must be much farther apart yet my vantage point just makes them look closer.  I also thought they were much farther away than they actually were.   As we pulled over and stopped the car, I could see that they were not airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, light from a ground source, etc.  We had about 30 seconds of clear visual from the time we stopped and tried to video to the time that the first object on the left phased out like turning off a light with a dimmer.   About 10 seconds later the second one on the right phased out the same way.  Now they did not fly into the clouds, they were below them.  The light they emitted was an orange glow like a torch.  I am familiar with most everything that flies and many FAA regs.  I also am able to use logic and reason to determine what I might be seeing.   All I know is that with my experience both educationally, professionally, and Spiritually, I was not able to determine what I saw but I am convinced that it was not something man made.  I have never seen anything like it before and am very aware of what it takes to make something fly and these two things did not match that knowledge.  They did not emit any sound that we were able to single out from the mild interstate traffic.  We would have heard a helicopter or possibly even a drone in my estimation.  Even if it had been something like! a drone then from the size it was, we would still have seen the object against the cloud ceiling via the ambient light emitted from the nearby urban infrastructure when the light it emitted phased out.   Again the light was a orange glow times two, fixed hovering in the sky about 1000 feet above the ground  with a constant fixed distance between the two.  The left one phased out first, then 5 to 10 seconds later, the second one phased out the same way leaving no trace or sound.   Again, I reiterate, I would know if they were airplanes, helicopters, drones, balloons, flairs, ground emitted light, etc and they were none of those.",

My friends and I sat at the edge of the Cumberland River and watched the stars above, and also looking at the skies (sic.  sky's) reflection in the water. No star had a reflection in the water but one.  I attempt to seek the star creating the reflection.  To my slight right on the opposite bank we were sitting, one of the stars begins to shift oddly in the sky and I immediately let my two friends know that one of the stars was not a star. We kinda freaked out a bit because its flight pattern was abnormal from what we generally are exposed to in the sky.  Plus we just learned something!  As it reached the near edge of the other side of the river, we got a decent look of the lights.  (Well, any view is a decent look.)  It was, oddly enough, the shape of a Mercedes Benz symbol minus the circle.  All I could explain it as is just three streaks of light coming from one point in the sky as it settles above the trees.  It sat there for a while, and then it just went up until it was out of our view.  After that, three more followed suite. All were the same shape. There was one of the same shape to our left higher than the others.  As time went by, it descended down and just stood still.  Felt like we were being monitored, but just slightly.  We kept a visual on it the minute we saw it.  It stayed with us the longest out of all. About 1:30, we see one of them descend behind the trees with its lights shining brighter and closer than before any of the others.  No more were seen afterwards.

Both nights with same amount of cloudiness, just big temperature difference.  Initially appear similar to spotlights but (1) no trail of light; (2) each would disappear behind clouds randomly; (3) area of night sky coverage too immense; (4) somewhat circular flight pattern while moving across sky; (5) immediate change of direction at random times; (6) quick change in speed of movement. Viewing from southeast Davidson County, Tennessee (Nashville).  Two roundish/oval lights moving separately, crossing over one another at times and each would occasionally disappear behind clouds.  Both with variation in speed of movement.  Quickly changed directions, even a complete 180 at times.  Viewing location less than 10 miles from airport with fair amount of air traffic.  All lights on planes were clear and crisp, commercial airplanes far smaller than the 2 orb-sha! ped lights and undoubtedly flying much lower in the sky than location of the 2 orb-lights. I took videos on the night of 2-13 but only had my iPhone and the videos don't do justice.   Can see the lights if watch in darkened room but it just didn't pick things up like a true camera could.",

I started thinking it looked more like something lower, like a plane, but it was just one white light and seemed stationary. While I was looking at it, it seemed to stretch or unfurl into a straight line.  When that happened, it looked more like a metallic thing, and the light (which before was all I could see) seemed to all move to the top, above the object...like it was either light reflecting off of it, or flame/exhaust shooting out of it. Then, it looked like it just shrunk into itself and disappeared, or maybe flew away in the direction perfectly away from me, so that it looked like it just shrunk into nothing.  Or maybe it just stopped reflecting light, it's hard to say. I saw another report from the 5th in a nearby area that sounded similar, so I decided to report mine as well.",

I took the picture because the sky looked so ominous and strange that day.  But, upon later reflection of the photo I took that day, I noticed a small collection of lights in the background in the sky with a green tint.  Naturally, I zoomed in to get a better look only to find a classic \"UFO\" shape -- a circle formation made out of lights. Strangely, I was carpooling with a friend that day and she also took a picture of the dark-clouded sky.  We took pictures at the exact same time as marked by the date and time on our phones, but her photo does not capture the UFO.  I actually have two pictures taken at the same hour:minute.  One is a little more blurry because a car was driving in the distance, but, both of my photo's capture the unidentified object pretty clearly. Personally, I've never been one to believe in UFO's, though, I believe there is most definitely \"life\" outside of Earth.  For all I know, UFO's could be the government screwing with us.  I don't really know.  What I am certain of is that I didn't notice the object at the time the picture was taken -- I was too distracted by the sky.  Additionally, I didn't go back and look at the pictures I took until a month later when I noticed something tiny in the background.  To clear any misconceptions - I don't own photoshop or know how to use photoshop.  I'm sure there is enough technology out there to check and see if anything was added to a photo.  If such technology were to be used on my two photos of the object, it would appear they have not been tampered with in any way. Hope this report helps some UFO tracker out there!",

I brought it to the attention of my  parents, a retired middle school teacher of 32 years and a retired Corrections Officer/truck driver turned truck driving instructor and certified license examiner. We watched the \"star\" flicker between reddish orange and white as it slowly moved East across the sky.  My father noted that any plane moving that slowly would have fallen from the sky.  The light dimmed as the \"star\" turned South and began moving faster toward our house.  My mother and I quickly went outside to see if we could see the actual craft instead of just the light.  It changed course slightly, instead taking it higher and further to the side behind some trees rather than directly overhead. We never heard the sound of a plane engine or rotor of a helicopter. As we were watching the \"star\" through the trees now heading Southeast, another object flew Northeast overhead very low but much quicker.  It looked like the lights of a helicopter, but again, absolutely no sound. We are very accustomed to hospital helicopters flying overhead between Rocky Mount, Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, and Greenville at all hours. We know how they look and what they sound like. We know the sounds of the occasional military helicopter making a night flight.  These lights looked like helicopters, but moved too slowly and were completely silent. This is not the first time we have seen lights with no sound.",

Either it was military or something local/something to do with Christmas...? Idk (I doubt).  It was flying in the northwest direction. This object made no noise whatsoever.

      "story": "Gigantic Silver cigar shape craft passed in silence over our home. When I was 6 years old, my family lived on the outskirts of Nashville, Tennessee in the country.   We had a paved driveway that was next to the house.  One afternoon, I was outside playing on the driveway with my Hot Wheels matchbox cars.  At some point, I recall seeing what looked like a floating aluminum pie plate (bottom facing forward) coming toward the house (at the time I said it looked like the bottom of a Jiffy Pop Popcorn pan).  It looked as though it was slowly rotating and moved silently but quickly toward the house.  At first, I wondered if it was going to crash as it was flying so low and was so large, but it continued on its trajectory and silently floated overhead.   As the front approached me, I realized that it was actually a very long cigar-shaped, silver-colored cylinder.  As it passed overhead it appeared to be so low that I got excited and jumped to see if I could touch the bottom of it.   When I couldn't touch it, I realized that my perception was clouded and I couldn't tell how close it was.  As it passed overhead, the body of the craft was wider than our entire house, such that the area where I stood became darkened from the shadow it cast.   There were some square dark gray hatches in places on the hull and as the craft was passing overhead, I remember clearly noting that the craft was higher than the roof of the house (perhaps 20 feet over the rooftop).  I have no visual or auditory evidence to support it, but at some point, I felt that the craft was occupied and the occupants were aware of my presence.  This scared me, and as a result, I ran inside the kitchen and told my mother that there was a big silver thing flying over the house.  She was washing dishes from lunch.  I remember being annoyed that it was taking her so long to come outside, but when I ran back out, she quickly joined me.  By this time, the object had passed and my mother and I both saw what appeared as a small aluminum pie plate the size of a golf ball rotating off into the distance.   My mother saw the craft as it departed.   To me, she didn't appear to be impressed by the sighting, but it is clear that she accounted the event to my father.  I recall the next day, we were watching a football game and my father pointed out the GoodYear blimp.  He asked me if that was what I had seen.   I told him it was not, because what I saw was shaped like a giant silver pencil and had no writing on it.  He also pointed out the undercarriage and the propellers to me.  I told him that it had no carriage underneath and there was no motor and no propellers and that it was slowly turning and made no noise.  At the end of my account, my father sternly told me to say that I saw a blimp.  Over 50 years later, I have always remembered this, and my life experiences have not explained away the sighting as a blimp.

He has worked in a position of considerable responsibility as a public employee, and we suspect he is an excellent witness.  PD))",

The object started near west (~260 deg) and continued to east alternating between very bright flashes and dim flashes over different intervals.  It crossed near the rate of a plane but very direct.  It was dusk with just a bit of light blue on the horizon and the stars of the Big Dipper were just becoming visible.  The brightness for a brief flash was as bright as the surface of the moon and was consistently brighter than Venus.  I checked HA ((www.Heavens-Above.com)), and nothing matched the discription.

A sound best characterized as a blend of flying insect,and electrical buzz permeated the room and was perceived to be moving in front of me, around the room.  The amplitude was not soft but quite discernible. The sound then localized at a wall mirror on the left side of the TV stand.  The mirror began to move on the two nails that served as its anchor point.  The sound stopped as the mirror kept moving. My subjective sense tells me that possibly, this was a directed intelligently controlled event. An examination of the wall behind the mirror revealed nothing.  No bug found, no sound. I had the sense to video with my cell phone, but the camera app kept switching off to home screen.  Nevertheless I have some footage. I live near the airport in Nashville and am wondering if any unusual aerial or meteorological phenomena occurred.",

It was extremely close to us flying over a heavily traffic congested area. I couldn\u2019t look away.  My boyfriend scrambled to hand me my phone to take a picture but it was too late.

I noticed a bright silver ball object hovering high in the sky.  I watched it for one minute trying to see if it would move but it did not.  It appeared to be glittering or twinkling.   Then, far to the right of the object a brilliant blue light appeared and shortly thereafter a scarlet red light below it.  (The red and blue lights also appeared ball like but were not scintillating like the silver ball.)  Then simultaneously the blue and red light moved towards the silver light and then stopped before meeting.  All three lights appeared to be locked in a formation like they were somehow connected.  Suddenly and slowly, they began to move together in the sky.   I watched for several minutes and thought I was filming them on my phone but as it turns out, I forgot to push record.  At the very beginning of the ordeal, I snapped a picture of the sky, hoping to catch something.   When I arrived home and zoomed in on the picture, I noticed that I captured the silver ball before the others appeared.   I have no explanation for what I saw and it was by far the most other worldly thing I have experienced in my life.",
