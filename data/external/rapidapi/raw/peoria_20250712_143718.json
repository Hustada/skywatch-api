It was cigar shaped, but had a huge bulge in the middle (I used to call it a pregnant joint - if you are familiar with how that would look - skinny on the ends but bulging in the middle.  It made no noise at all and had circular shapes on the front which emitted different colored lights - like it pulsated the lights - orange to red to green to blue.  They were the most brilliant colors I\u2019ve ever seen it\u2019s hard to describe how perfect the colors were.  It was huge like an aircraft carrier in the sky.  It was floating and did not move at all.  I parked in my driveway and ran inside to tell my Roomate.  By the time I was outside, it was gone but there as a trail of haze.  I will never forget it.

It zoomed back to the right (south) and stoped for another 5 seconds.  I watched it zoom around stopping and going for about 2 minutes.  Then it went up and zoomed down in a confusing spiral toward the earth nearby.   In a panick, I yelled for my Fiance, I had to run about 50 ft inside to shake him awake.  When we got outside, it was still there in the sky above the neigborhood zooming around.  It looked like it was over the neighbors house at one point hovering.  I watched as it split into two red lights whith a single green dot between and then morphed back into the single red light then zoomed into a far neighborhood (Northwest) as it seemed to fall to the earth.   I tried to finish watering my garden after my husband went inaide i saw it zoom west from the Northeast of my house as if above a nearby neighborhood.

      "story": "Surprised by diffuse appearing object On Sunday, May 5th, I was on my boat at Lake Pleasant, Arizona.  I had spent the night on the boat and was almost ready to go back to the dock.  I was about \u00bc mile north of the 4 lane launch ramp at the north end of the lake.  At 8:30 am I was drifting with a slight breeze from the north, pushing me toward the dock to the south.  I had a line in the water, fishing, with a large brimmed hat and polarized sunglasses.  The weather was sunny and clear, typical Arizona. I glanced up, looking south, and noticed what I at first thought might be some spiderwebs caught between my fishing rods, which were mounted on either side of the console.  Whatever it was, it was diffuse, and somewhat hard to distinguish, much like the sun looks glinting off spiderwebs.  Its relative size was about that of a full moon, about the size of an aspirin tablet at arm's length.  It was completely stationary.  After a few seconds I thought what I was seeing might be some reflection hitting my sunglasses.  I moved my head up and down, trying to determine where a reflection might be coming from.  At that moment the object moved on a level horizontal path toward the west, out of my visual range, in a fraction of a second.  The acceleration was so great that by the time the object had moved to the right edge of my vision, I could no longer track it.  At that moment I realized what I had witnessed.  There were some people in kayaks, a couple of guys fishing and some other boats to the north and east of my position. The environment was quiet, and I heard absolutely nothing that could be associated with the object \u2013 it was completely silent. I would estimate that it was about 40 degrees in elevation and on a bearing of 180 to 200 degrees. Object size and distance were impossible to determine. The object appeared somewhat like two slightly elongated top hamburger buns, with the bottom bun inverted. There was a slight darker band separating the top and bottom sections. Width to height was about 3 to 1. The overall impression was that of a light weight, white fabric, almost with some translucent quality to it. I did not detect anything unusual looking through my polarized sunglasses.  I am an experienced UFO researcher, yet it was not until the object shot out of sight that I realized what I had seen.",

It was roughly 9:30pm.   There were 5 lights that I could make out.  Very faint.  They were traveling upwards it seemed, and they were traveling at different speeds, as if they were a family walking with a few child stragglers trying to catch up.  I had no explanation, and soon they just faded still travelling upward.   I was dumbfounded people could just discard it and go back to dancing--this was my first time seeing anything in the night sky that couldn\u2019t be explained.

Off to the north of Peoria a large storm was passing by, far enough away to provide us a grand show  of lighting as we sat in front of the Northmoor Observatory on Leo Donovan Golf Course in North Peoria. Two of us were there in the daylight waiting for it to get dark. It was our turn to show the public around the evening sky as members of the Peoria Astronomical Society. We were watching the storm when a dark moving shape appeared in the periferal vision of my left eye. The black circle was approaching from the west. At first I thought it was a goose flying toward the pond behind the observatory. We had seen a couple take off from there a little earlier. But, as it got closer I could not see any wings. My observing partner was engrossed in watching the storm and had not noticed this object coming right at us. I called his attention to it. \u201cIs that a balloon?\u201d he said. My thought exactly. But, we both quickly realized this object was moving very fast, and in a straight line. \u201cCould a balloon move in a straight line that fast?\u201d I said. We both quickly concluded that did not seem plausible to us. We each looked at our cell phones. It was 8:40 p.m. When the object passed over us we saw a different shape. It had looked round while coming toward us. As it passed overhead we saw it looked like a capital B laying on its side. And, as it passed overhead it tilted slightly to the south showing a streak of gray, but the color was flat, not reflective. There was not any sound We looked at each other and watched the item disappear into the horizon to the east never altering its speed as far as we could tell or its direction.

No strobe light, no red/green wingtip lights, no colors, no flashing.  No turn, bank, pitch up or down.   No way to judge size or altitude.  Traversed about 45 degrees of the sky while it was visible, at an elevation angle of about 75 degrees, from west of my location to east of my location.   Initial impression was that it was a flock of white birds (e.g., geese) slowly flying in formation perhaps 100 feet above my house's roof, but then I realized that there were no flapping wings, no relative motion between the white spots whatsoever, and no ground lights capable of illuminating anything like that -- had to be self-illunminated.   Disappeared rather suddenly, but not instantaneously, as it moved away from me.  I speculate that it might have been a B2 \"flying wing\" bomber if they had no typical civil aircraft running lights, an array of between 7 to 11 soft-white lights on the leading edge, and were capable of virtually silent motion.  I do live just a few miles NE of Luke AFB, AZ.   I was in a spa (hot tub) at the time, so its noise could have been masking quiet sounds from the object, but I routinely easily hear normal propeller, jet and helicopter sounds when they fly nearby while I'm in the spa.   Could have been a very large object or formation of objects very high up (although there was no discernible relative motion between the lights whatsoever), or something much smaller and much lower.   If it was something the size of a B2, it could only have been a few hundred feet in altitude.",

Headline: UFO at a stone's throw  This story takes place in 1992 in Illinois. My friend and I were parked facing north at night in the summer on a small concrete bridge over a small creek in rural Illinois.  We were not quite ready to go home and wanted to continue our conversation about \"girlfriends.\"  The weather was cloudy and misty.  We could see sheet lighting in the distance.  My car windows had droplets of water on them.  I sat in the driver's seat, my friend sat in the passenger's seat of my Ford Escort. The creek bridge had cement guardrails that were almost perfectly level with where the car windows started.  I suspect this was a purposeful choice by the architect. The road continued on north to a T-section about 1/4 down the road.  Beyond that intersection was a large hill that spanned for miles in each direction.  Approach to the creek bridge was as if going down a slight hill, and the incline continued on for awhile and then began sloping up again toward the T-section.  We were of a slightly higher altitude than the cornfields directly to the left and right front of us that bordered the creek.  The border of the creek was a slight hill that blocked view of the field beyond to our right (2 o'clock).  Over our right shoulders at about 4 o'clock (direction), was four-story tall mound/hill left over from an old gravel pit that had trees and brush all over it.  This mound followed the other creek border for about a half a mile to the east. So from our perspective, we could not see the field to our right front, nor see beyond over the hill over our right shoulders.  The creek was essentially bordered on both sides with land that stretched out as far as the eye could see.  It was here that we watched the lighting in the distance.   I could see the lightening from tens of miles away over the top of the distant hills, but there was additional light coming from closer up.  At first I just dismissed it as ball lighting, but I could see the light illuminating the mist just above the hill.  I could not see into the field where the light seemed to be coming from, just the effects of the light on the trees on the border of the creek.  I stopped my friend from talking and said, \"Friend, why is that lightening going on and off with a beat.  Nature is not that exact.\"  I began snapping my fingers to the rate of the light from the field going on and off.  On, snap, off, snap.  It was a perfect beat (I am a musician).  I tol! d my friend to roll down his window and just as the window rolled down, a craft popped out from behind the hill.  It was level with us, and we were approximately at most 10 ft from the craft.  I could have easily jumped on top of the craft from the side of the bridge without straining myself. I was speechless.  At the time I was morally opposed to the idea of alien spacecraft.  My family were strict Christians who specifically were taught at our denomination that humans on Earth were the only organic life in the universe.  I was 100% against the ideas of aliens existing.  Yet, here before me and my friend was this totally silent craft, about the size of a large SUV, hovering, silently. I broke the silence by startling loudly, \"THAT IS NOT A UFO!\"  At the time that I said that, the craft was just a little past us.  The craft was almost directly to our right, but a little farther past us at that point.  It abruptly changed course (as if it heard me) and either turned off its lights, put on a cloaking device or did something else because it seemed to just go right into the opposite hill, but more likely it just went \"dark.\"  I revved up my engine and drove away very fast.  My perspective on everything had just come crashing down in one fell swoop of time no more than 3 minutes long. I got to my house, where my friend's car was, and he asked me to follow him back home (because he was too freaked out to go over that bridge alone).  So I followed him home.  By the time I got back to the bridge, my fear had gone down, and I was filled with wonder.  The storm had passed, so I parked on the bridge again alone, turned on a Cure CD and sat Indian style on the roof of my car, searching the landscape and the sky for anything out of the ordinary. Nothing.  Silence. Oddly, it was from that moment on that I started to experience the phenomenon known as \"synchronicity.\"  As I drove back to my house that night, I though, \"what if when I get home my family has been abducted!\"  I got home and went to my parent's bedroom and listened for breathing.  Nothing, so I turned on the light and the bed was empty and made, at like 2 a.m.!  I ran to my sister's rooms and they were all empty too.  I was freaked out so I just collapsed in bed, thinking in the morning this will all be resolved. I awoke to a call from my mother that the family left town unexpectedly that evening to visit relatives. Description of the craft:  Closure took over in my perception of the craft, so my brain processed the craft as looking like the time machine in Back to the Future (big fan at the time).  It was the only way my brain could process a floating silent vehicle, that and it also did look a lot like that craft.  It had a metallic brushed reflective surface, with an area like a car where the \"people\" were transported, and then a front and back section much like our engine and trunk section.  It as the classic saucer shape, but without the dramatic flaring sides.   It had lights in various places on the exterior but it all happened so fast and I was so stunned that I couldn't tell you the exact placement, but my friend who had no such \"stunned\" effect because he was already a believer, said he saw lights in the back, front, top and bottom of the craft. For now, any contact, I would prefer it to be done via email. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident in 1992 is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "String of lights in Phoenix area One evening in early December, 2010, my husband and I were entertaining some guests on our back patio in north Peoria, Arizona.  As I was gazing at the sky, I noticed a string of about 3-4 bright amber lights in what looked like a line formation moving toward us from the west in a northeasterly direction.   I thought the lights looked strange, so I focused on them and noticed several more of these lights coming up behind the others from over a mountain to the west.  I then pointed them out to the others and we all became very excited and inquisitive wondering what they could be.   For the next 10-15 minutes or so, it seemed like an endless stream of lights coming one behind the other.  As they came closer to the east, we listened to hear if maybe they were Air Force jets, but we could hear absolutely nothing.  I\u2019m estimating that there were upwards to 19 or so lights that we counted over a period of about 10-15 minutes.   Everyone agreed that these lights looked odd and didn\u2019t appear to be aircraft we had ever seen before, especially since they were amber colored and had no white or red lights on them that we could see.   As we continued to watch, the lights seemed to change direction and began to head southwest until we could no longer see them.   I turned on the TV hoping to hear something about these strange lights, but I never did.   Were these aircraft from Luke Air Force base or were they something else entirely.  Have you received other reports about these lights or know what they were?   Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

For lack of anything else we have seen like this I will use the Space station for comparison.  Seen at an altitude less then a commercial airplane. My wife and I are avid Sky gazers and regularly catch the Space Station when able to view. First let me say what it wasn\u2019t.  This was not the Space Station, even though it went across the sky at the Speed of the Space Station. Nor was it at the altitude of the Space Station.  This was much closer, half the height of the highest commercial plane.  The Space Station, even at it\u2019s lowest points on the horizon is a bright white and shiny, with straight definable edges and moving super fast across the sky.   My wife and I seen a Bright, deep burnt orange colored  ball with No tail, such as a shooting star, moving through the sky. Darker at the center, slightly lighter at the leading edge. We were sitting behind our house on the west side facing north.  The object came from the East South East direction across the north end of our house.  moving North at about 30 to 35 degrees at it highest point, in comparison to our regular sightings of the space station.  The object  was around 3 times the size of the Space Station at it\u2019s closest point right after it came out from behind the house and diminished as  moved away toward the north.. Don\u2019t\u2019 think it was a space craft, it never changed direction or speed.  Don\u2019t\u2019 think it was a comet or shooting star, it had no tail, yet it looked hot, glowing as if still burning hot from entering from outer space. I don\u2019t know what this was but after passing Peoria Illinois, someone, Some Where between Rockford, Il. and Chicago, Il. Had to of seen this also.   This was one of the most highly visible skyward events we have ever seen. And that is saying something for us, because within the last week or so we seen a shooting star moving east to west that brightened our  backyard before burning out. We were not looking up at the sky at the time, it was our yard getting brighter that made us look up to notice this object. I hope someone else out there enjoyed the bright burnt orange object in the sky tonight. We sure did!",

That object did not appear to fall as fast as something falling to earth.  It could have been something dropped with a parachute with a light attached.   We watched it with appeared to be plane lights which then appeared to fly in a circle for about a couple of minutes.   Then it straightened out and headed in the direction of Sky Harbor airport in Phx, descending as would a normal plane coming in for a landing. This whole time we believed it might be a plane with some serious mechanical problems, but whatever it dropped was out of the ordinary and we couldn\u2019t find any mention of any unusual occurrences on any news reports.",

      "story": "Dozens of pink and white orbs and a morphing triangle in the Arizona sky This afternoon about 12 pm (daytime) I noticed an airplane flying overhead moving to the west, and happened to look up. Beneath the aircraft and to the right of it, below it, I witnessed an egg shaped orb hovering about mid-sky.  I went inside to retrieve my binoculars (10x50 5.5 degrees H-15) and I could plainly see two orbs.  One was black and the other was pink or salmon pink in color. The distance was est. 5 miles down range approx.. acute 45 degrees and maintaining position in mid heaven as we faced West. The black orb suddenly dropped near the ground, rose up and then moved rapidly out of view.  The pink orb or egg shaped ball remained in place.  I gave the binoculars to my wife and she watched for about a minute before the pink orb moved rapidly to the lower left of the lens view, and then wisped very quickly to the right of view (northward) and disappeared out of view over the horizon.  Moments later we both saw no less than five objects that appeared to ! be round balls of light.  These balls of light began making erratic movements apparently with no intention.  Several other translucent objects appeared during this time and had the appearance of round luminous plasma, were pinkish in color, and each one had a notch at one end of them.  They looked like a pie with a piece missing.  At times the larger objects would turn facing us and were at least as large as a quarter or a fifty cent piece by binocular view.  Very plain to see. During this time, there appeared to be a meteor storm (streaks in the sky, a sort of white vapor) except for the fact that the streaks moved or skipped vertically in the sky and seemed to defy physics.  After several hours of watching these orbs of light or saucers, moving all over the sky in different directions and formations, and at varied speeds, at about 1:50 pm. what looked like a plasma orb, translucent and pink in color,floating at high altitude and changing shape, began moving toward our house very slowly at about mid sky. Upon reaching a point about a mile(?) downrange and hovering at about 80 degrees overhead, the object suddenly accelerated and flew directly over our neighborhood at what looked to be about 2,000 feet up. Within 5 minutes we heard the sound of F-14's from the local air base firing up. Moments later Four F-14's took off in the same northward direction as the craft had. The events may not be related, but it did add a lot of suspense to the situation.  Observed this at about 3 pm An object, triangular in shape, inverting itself. Looked like red lava in the middle encased by pink triangle, pulsating. Moved slowly to the east, just overhead , then vanished.  After five hours of watching these objects they eventually thinned out to just two or three random sightings, and then just stopped showing up altogether at about 5 pm. This total display lasted 5 hours, from 12 pm. until 5 pm. We heard no sounds associated to these objects and did not meet any aliens, nor do i personally know any aliens.  This accounting is absolute truth as best as I can describe or understand it.",

As our vehicle got further from the city, the treeline allowed us to see what was previously obscured: two sets of what appeared to be TRIANGULAR LIGHTS. The two sets of lights were EAST from our location. We were very confused and fascinated at first, uncertain of what we were seeing. My companioned asked, &quot;Are those stars?&quot; But I had mistaken them as lights of communication towers. However, we quickly both understood neither was correct, as:  -We were unable to see any stars due to light pollution from being near the city. -There are no communication towers in that specific spot or at that specific elevation. -The set of lights nearest to us were found to be slowly moving.  There were two triangles, very large and very peculiar ih their shape and position in the sky. It was enough that we immediately knew we were not witnessing something normal. We have traversed Route 6 many times at night and never have seen these before. Both sets had three individual lights which flickered or twinkled like fire or a very bright star. The color of the lights was ORANGE-RED. We pulled over on the side of Route 6 and turned off our lights to get a better view after approximately two minutes of witnessing the phenomenon.  By this point, the lights furthest from us (Figure B in my illustration) were either too distant/sunken behind the tree line to see, or had very peculiarly suddenly disappeared. Either way, we were unable to see Figure B any longer. Figure A (the nearer set), was drifting very slowly toward our location. NO SOUND was issued from the lights. I strained to see any more details, but was unable to. I was unable to see any visible lines or structure of any kind between or connecting the lights. I was unable to determine the make or nature of the lights, other than that they resembled fire of some kind, orange and flickering.  Unfortunely, I am not equipped to determine how high the lights were, but am able to say they were below a thin and scattered/spotty cloud cover.  One by one, they began to slowly fade. First the light nearest us, and then the two behind at the further end of the triangle. The lights dimmed very slowly and then went completely dark. We were unable to see anything again after that, and after waiting for a moment, once more turned on the vehicle's lights and resumed our drive.  I distinctly recall seeing a program on television a year before about triangular sets of lights a few years back in Tinsley Park, which is a few hours from this location. From the amateur footage and photographs I saw on the television, these lights matched them very well. I wanted to obtain a photograph or video footage as proof of the objects, but the triangles' lights were not bright nor large enough for my phone to be able to capture among the surrounding darkness.  No visible moon was present at the time.  After pulling alongside the road, the remaining lights were visible for approximately 2-3 more minutes, making the total window of visibility at approximately 4-5 minutes.",

Shortly after I stepped outside, I observed several (approximately 5 or 6) orange or red round objects in the sky to the north of our apartment.  For purposes of orientation, I can say that the objects were visible north of the intersection of Allen Rd. and Willow Knolls Rd. over that area\u2019s car dealerships (Lexus, Toyota, Nissan).  The objects were in some sort of pattern, possibly a diamond shape.  At first I thought the pattern looked like a fireworks display of some sort, but I heard no explosions.  In fact, I did not hear any noise at all coming from the area.  I pointed the objects out to my wife and she began trying to take photos and video with my cellular phone.  Unfortunately, upon review of the video, the objects were not visible.  We also saw a male exit a vehicle up the road (unknown how many passengers we! re in the car) from our apartment to look at the objects, but we did not speak to each other. As we continued to observe the objects in the sky, we noticed that some of the objects would suddenly fade away.  However, we also saw new orange/red round objects rising up from the ground in the same area north of our apartment.  While they were ascending, I noticed that the objects hovered in a manner that was somewhat similar to helicopters. But, I have never seen helicopters move quite like this and I can\u2019t imagine why helicopters would be forming patterns in the sky at night.  The rising objects then joined the other objects before they also vanished.  By about 2305 hrs, all of the objects were gone.",

Our home is approximately one mile south of West Wing Mountain which is located in the West Wing Mountain Preserve.   About 5:15am this morning, Wednesday, February 22, I took our three dogs out into the backyard.   Looking north, towards West Wing Mountain, I noticed a blue light which appeared to be hovering several hundred feet above the highest peak.  One of my dogs seemed to notice the light as well, as he gazed towards the light.   After maybe twenty seconds, the light increased in its intensity for about five seconds before returning to its previous lower brightness.  I would say that the light increased its brightness by a factor of four or five.  It repeated that pattern of temporarily increasing its brightness three times.   Then, after another twenty seconds or so, it suddenly disappeared as if a switch had been thrown.  My dog then acted very agitated and wanted to go back! inside our home.  The light did not move at any time we were watching it and there was no sound of any kind coming from its direction.   A few seconds after the light disappeared, a commercial jet aircraft flew over our home headed from Phoenix towards the northwest.",

I heard a weird noise getting louder outside my window to the north. I cannot describe the sound (it was something I have never heard before - maybe like a machine) but it got louder over the music I was playing. I immediately got out of bed to turn the music off so I could figure out this sound I was hearing. I got up out of bed, the sound stopped, I was now facing my other bedroom window to the south (all blinds were closed).  As soon as the sound stopped, I saw brilliant white flashing lights outside my window.  It was like 50 strobe lights turned on for about 5-10 seconds. The only word I can describe this would be &quot;spectacular.&quot; Everything happened so fast and the brilliance of these white lights seems unearthly to me... I called two police stations in the morning to see if there were any reports of this unusual phenomenon, but there were none reported.

Last night, while taking the dogs out for the night, I noticed a bright white light over West Wing Mountain, which is here in Peoria, AZ.  The light suddenly burst into several smaller white lights which then began to move around each other.  When the light &quot;burst&quot; there were glowing streamers briefly projected out from the original light, which gave the initial appearance of a pyrotechnic.  However, after about a minute, they all suddenly disappeared. Another minute or so went by and then three white lights re-appeared in the same location as the previous lights.  These three were of a brighter intensity and continued to move around each other, but the movement was much slower than earlier.  After about two minutes, these three then suddenly disappeared as well, as if a switch were thrown. After a short delay, several more lights appeared, but this time there was about ten to twelve of them.  They were of different intensities and were of differing colors, red, blue, yellow and white.  These were also moving around, but at a quicker speed, like the first appearance.  The movement was deliberate, as if they were circling each other, but the entire formation itself remained stationary.  The lights disappeared about a minute later and did not reappear again. This is the second time that I have seen an unknown light over West Wing Mountain.  In February of 2012, I saw an unknown blue light early one morning, which I reported to the center later that day.",

So then this object stopped moving i would say it stopped near the 101 close to Phoenix Cardinals stadium.  So when it stopped, two smaller red things came out of it directly going down to the city!   I was recording all this at the time but when i tried to look back at it, it was gone!  The recording only shows when I am bearly going to move my camera up to record these lights!  Anyhow when these two lights go down the bigger object turns white, like glowing supper bright and it keeps going west for about a 2 to 5 second distance in the air and it drops another object which als! o goes straight down to the city, mean while the bigger object disappears at an extremely fast speed!  Then the first two objects come back up and also disappear!  Air craft then started appearing around the same area!

      "story": "Amber sphere breaks up into multiple fragments, 2 seperate repeated events. Early on the morning of December 21, 2014, I had noticed a bright flickering amber-colored light in the North horizon.  I watched it fly south, toward my direction, in a non-linear fashion until it was practically right overhead, still slightly to the North.  The single light dimmed temporarily before flaring up and breaking up into 3-5 different pieces that all went separate directions at different speeds.  When the original light broke up, it brightened immensely and seemed to fall apart, with the separate pieces having tails similar to a small fireball.  Some stayed illuminated, some dimmed to faint red dots barely discernable from the night stars.  After about 15-20 seconds, all of the lights had dimmed to blinking red dots flying in separate directions. About 2 minutes after this event occurred, another amber-colored light appeared on the Northern horizon, in the same exact area and followed the same general path in the sky. The flickering amber light flew to the same general area that I had seen the previous one in, and broke apart in the same manner as the first, dispersing fireball-like lights in separate directions that all eventually turned into blinking red lights.  The lights changed direction and speed, but never fast enough to seem like a shooting star or something falling into our atmosphere. I was compelled enough to call the local Non-Emergency line to report this incident, and they actually dispatched two units to my house fairly quickly, within 10 minutes of my call.  I was surprised to say the least.  By the time they had shown up, the lights were gone and I was left defending my sobriety and right state of mind.  After a few minutes describing what I had seen, the police jovially dismissed me by stating, \"Sadly enough, I don't have the Magic School Bus, and I can't fly up there and investigate what you saw.\"   I actually appreciated his humor and thanked him for his time.",

Movement caught my peripheral vision, causing me to look up.  What I noticed surprised me a great deal.  Over my head, traveling quite slowly at, I'd estimate maybe 20mph, was a very large seemingly solid V-shaped object, marked at intervals by slightly yellowish-whitish round lights.  I was so taken aback by this silent figure, I stared very intently and noticed that in between these lights, it was not possible to see stars, which, to me, indicated that the lights were part of some craft, which I had never before seen.  It was a very clear night, and stars were visible in other parts of the sky.   I was so surprised, I turned around and walked back through our courtyard to get my father, who I was certain could conf! irm what I was seeing.  I walked in and explained to him what I saw and that he needed to come outside, but by the time we both arrived back in the courtyard, the lights were much further away and we couldn't examine it further.   My friend later arrived and stated that he, too, had seen the strange formation of lights and watched it disappear on the horizon to the south, which had been the direction it was traveling when I'd stood beneath it.   I'd estimate that it was maybe 800-1,000 feet above me, but shockingly silent.  I could hear no motor, no propulsion of any kind while standing beneath it as it made its trek from north to south over me.",

We decided to watch it further for a bit, thinking it was a plane but it remained stationary until we came close to a nearby lighted shopping center and saw that it flashed red and green.  Upon entering the shopping center, one of the buildings blocked our view of it, and by the time we backed up so we could see it was about 3-5 miles away within a few seconds.   We then proceeded to watch it until it disappeared miles away.",

      "story": "Entities in my home November 15, 2016 Encounter with 3 beings: I awoke around 3 am to see 3 beings standing in my bedroom door.  They are translucent, soft light emanating from their bodies.  I sat up in my bed and I stared intently. My impression was a Mother with a child. She was tall and lean with olive-shaped dark eyes. She had long arms and she was without clothing. I could not make out any specific shapes we would call genitals.  Her mouth was narrow with an oval shaped face, no hair on the body.  The child entity stood next to the mother holding her leg.  The child came up to her hip in height.  I got the feeling this was a boy.  Same appearance only the head was shaped slightly smaller and stout with arms and legs.  The eyes were big and looking at me as if this was its first time seeing a human being. The third entity stood behind them. Same soft light emanating from the body. At this point, I could tell all 3 bodies seemed to be floating like a hologram. The 3rd entity was different in that on top of its head were these antenna with olive-shaped eyes. There must have been 8 or so of these attached to the head and looked like they were part of the scalp. I had the impression this being was a scout and the antenna were cameras. I went to get up out of bed and the beings turned their backs and floated down the hallway and just disappeared.  I thought ok, that was a strange experience. The next evening around the same time, 3 am.  The being with the antenna on the head appeared standing in my hall near my coat closet and hung onto the woodwork. I looked up and waved my hand. It matched my hand wave and a slight smile like a Mona Lisa Smile appeared on its face.  I went to get up and it disappeared. I could only describe the movement of the beings like watching seaweed floating in the ocean. They were opaque but I could see through them.  I remember feeling a joy in my heart unlike any other. An overwhelming sense of love and wonderment. It was a marvelous experience. I wish to remain anonymous. My family would not believe me, I have told 2 close friends. Whether they believe I do not care. I felt like I should share. I believe these beings are walking among us at this moment. Observing us. Maybe they are here to help or just waiting to pick up the pieces after we are gone. Sincerely,  A believer",

      "story": "7 red-orange orbs in Peoria, IL, sky on 9/14/18 First of all, I am not a night sky watcher, astronomer, UFO hunter, weather tracker or any form of such things.  I might watch a UFO documentary once in a while, but I want nothing to do with aliens, both fictional or non-fictional.  I happen to know a few of the constellations from school and my father.  I saw Neptune through a telescope once, out of state.  I know a little bit about weather but this is the extent of my experience with such things. I was crossing a parking lot to go home tonight and I saw a strange man cross my path.  I looked up and he turned to look at me.  When I realized he wasn\u2019t interested in me, I just watched him for a couple seconds and then something caught my eye overhead of him. When I realized what I was seeing, I turned to see if the man was still around because I wanted to draw his attention to the lights but he was already gone. I looked up to see two reddish-orange orbs flying upward in the north sky.  I just stopped to watch them.  Usually, there are planes that cross this path going south to the nearby Peoria Airport.  The lights were big like the lights of a big plane nearby.  They were spaced far enough I thought they were the lights you see on either wing of a plane.  Only one problem, there was no plane in-between or attached to these lights. I watched them ascend, in a slight curve and then turn right (my left) and as they went over this one spot in the sky, they dimmed, almost turning white and completely fizzled out.  There was a single light coming up from the tree line, same kind of light but single.  I watched it ascend, also take a right turn and disappear in the exact location as the first two.  But again, before it completely disappeared there was another light ascending.  Also, these were doing this as in formation and pace and such. All together, there were the first pair of lights and then 5 single lights after -  7 lights total.  Every one of them disappeared in the exact same spot and in the same manner.  I was searching my brain for an explanation of what these were: planes, weather balloons, hot air balloons, falling stars, fireworks, comets, Chinese lanterns, helicopters, flares, you name it, I was thinking about it, and ruling each one out. I am colorblind with reds/greens/browns and can see these colors if the brightness and hue and lighting is just right. When Mars was visible people would say, \u201cLook how red it is!\u201d  And I could not see this for the longest time.  At one point, when it was at a different location, I was finally able to see a faint redness to it.  These orbs were very distinct, bright, true color-there was no question what color they were. Because I was coming home from a bunch of errands, I did not have my digital camera with me and I was not wearing a watch.  But it was somewhere between 9:00 PM and 9:30 PM and lasted close to 5-10 minutes. I was also questioning how the orbs just disappeared when I saw the first two and thought it was just a plane turning and making it skinnier from the angle.  I also thought about the fact that maybe this set of lights went into/behind a cloud.  But it didn\u2019t take me long to realize, there\u2019s no clouds! I could see the big dipper to my front left, another constellation (forget the name) to my front right and I could see a cluster of stars and individual stars where these lights kept disappearing. I scanned the sky to see when I would see the lights again and it was evident that when they looked like they fizzled out, that was the last I was going to see of them.  It almost gave the impression they went into a door, portal or whatever it was, to make them disappear.  I waited after the 7th one for almost 5 minutes to realize that the show was over. The thing too, is that had they turned to make it harder to see them, they would have eventually straightened out and I would have seen them again.  This did not happen.  I rushed home, set all the stuff down, grabbed my digital camera and went back out there.  I waited around another 10-15 minutes; I was hoping to see something again but nothing else happened. I called NBC WEEK 25 to inquire about this sighting and was transferred, but no one answered and it did not go to voicemail to leave a message.  I then decided to E-mail them but no one has responded as of yet.  I have also been scouring the internet for the past two days, to see if anyone posted this sighting, to no avail.  I really want to know if anyone else saw these and possibly know if these orbs are indeed UFO\u2019s or drones or something else.  I only know they are nothing I have ever seen before. One last thing I would like to point out is that when I was back out there with my camera, a plane went overhead that was very high-the height of a cross-country flight.  And I could see it fairly well, the blinking lights, the movement and such and the orbs I had seen earlier made this plane pale in comparison.",

Then we continued to watch both specks split apart and travel over our heads until it was completely behind our heads.  They traveled from the above the horizon over out heads to what appeared nearly 100-120 degree angle.
