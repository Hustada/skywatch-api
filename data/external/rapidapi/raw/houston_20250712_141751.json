      "story": "Unknown object with flashing lights and laser beam behind the Hou ARTCC building/very fast moving I was an air traffic controller at the time.  Often we'd see objects on our radar and on a few occasions NORAD would scramble on them. (That's another topic).   The incident that I'm reporting occurred after the end of my shift. Three of us were hanging around in the parking lot talking.  One controller made a comment that Venus was bright that night.   We then started visibly scanning the sky.  We noticed a brighter light to the North of the ARTCC building and wondered if the other light in the sky was indeed  Venus, then what could that be. (The back door of the center faces east and leads to the back parking lot). The object was standing still and was just visible above the far tree line. Someone made a comment that it was probably a street light.   An airliner became visible climbing out of IAH but farther North of the light we were looking at.  The light then dimmed.  As the plane got farther away on its climb out, the light came back to the full density as we had seen before.  That got our attention.  We were wondering out loud what it could be.   At that moment,  the object moved from our left to our right at an extremely fast speed and stopped immediatley. almost a blur.  As fast as you can turn your head from 10 oclock to 2 oclock was the speed it seemed to move. (if east was 12 on the clock, then the object moved from 10 to 2).  We could not judge how far away from us it was.   The object then just stood still for a minute or two.  Very bright red, blue and green lights starting flashing around the object.  A thin laser like beam of light, approximatley 6 to 12 inches in diameter, lit up part of the parking lot and starting scanning the parking lot.   All three of us ducked behind a car without saying a word.  The beam shut off and the flashing lights stopped.  The   white light on the object then came back on and the object began moving very slowly back to our ten oclock position and stopped at the exact location it was when we first noticied it.  We didn't say a word for about a minute.   When it sunk in what we had just seen, all three of us jumped in our cars and left for home.   The next day, we considered reporting this to a national hotline number in Washington D.C., that the FAA had provided us to report strange occurences that we observe on our radar screens (UFO's)  but no one ever  did for fear of losing our airman's certificate.

The luminescence was not intense but very obvious. The brightness remained fairly constant.  No windows, blinking lights, no hard solid edges or surfaces were apparent.  Clear sky/no clouds \u2026 good visibility.  The two objects were first seen when directly overhead.  Visually appeared to be at a fairly high altitude.  Visually appeared to be traveling at a very fast speed towards the east and in a straight path.  There was absolutely no audible sound generated by the objects during the entire time. The objects traveled in \"formation\" keeping maybe one to two widths apart from one another.  One of the objects traveled slightly ahead of the other. The objects maintained one rounded end of the oval shape pointed in the direction of travel.  There were no trails behind them and no apparent lights shining out from any part of the objects.  One of the incredible aspects of these objects is that on one, maybe two brief instances, they smoothly and quickly changed/switched positions in the \"formation\" so that now the other object was slightly in the \"lead.) I was already amazed by this sighting, when I saw the relative movement of the two objects to one another I was in awe!  I am a geologist. I view any natural phenomenon in a very critical light. I have always been extremely critical and skeptical of other reported sightings.   I have never seen/reported objects ever before.  I don\u2019t know what these objects were, but I\u2019ve gone through any logical list of things and nothing makes sense.  Quite often there are aircraft flying in this vicinity heading towards Houston Intercontinental, but these were something quite different.  I don\u2019t know what to think now.

The sun light bouncing off it made it appear to be super bright I'm guessing which made it hard to look directly at.  My co worker who came outside when I started yelling look over and over yelled \"what's that\" as he saw it from the side while I stood underneath it.  Looking straight up into even thought it hurt my eyes to do so I could see the heat it omitted from the bottom of it as if I was looking at the background of a hot paved road.  When it flew away the speed of it was incredible as it shot across the open skies westward towards the setting sun.  Later on I started experiencing a very uncomfortable shocking sensation behind my left ear which seem to exit on the top of my head.  I went and had a cat scan done to see why this was happening.

We are both in our 20s & were both sober & of sound mind at the time of the sighting. ((name deleted)) looked out the passenger window & asked \"What is that?\".I looked over to my right(south) & saw the object as what I dimissed at first glance as a passenger plane,as the Bush Intercontinental Airport is in the NW area of Houston(south of our location).  ((fiancee)) then said \"But,it's not moving.\" I looked again & slowed the car to about 20mph & observed the \"craft\" was indeed perfectly still hovering over trees & a shopping center in the distance. We both observed that it's lights were forming a triangle(7 white lights at the points & along it's 3 edges with 1 large white pulsating light in the center on the bottom.The craft could easily be mistaken as a jumbo jet, but it's behavior indicated otherwise.  A few seconds after we noticed it hovering, it began to slowly accelerate S/W at low speed & at a perfect line without dipping or wavering as a plane would at low altitude.I completely stopped the car on the overpass with no other cars on the road ahead or behind.   As we watched the craft it then did something even more strange.  It stopped completely & hovered again without any motion or sound,as if it noticed us. We then proceeded down the road to pull over out of the road but it began to move S/W again over the trees which obstructed our sight.I made a U-turn in order to chase it & continued back over the bridge to the west.  Once back over we saw nothing in the sky. The only lights visible were from the traffic below on Hwy 59 & the tower lights on the freeway. This area is a high traffic area for planes & helicopters but after we saw the triangular UFO there was no more air traffic at all. The event lasted between 1-2 min. Strange but true.  I called the local 13 Eye Witness News Tip Line an hour later.  I was the only report at the time regarding this sighting.",

      "story": "What I experenced at age 4 and the,  at 14 years old. when I was 4 years old.  I am now 56.  It was after my family had all went to bed for the night.  I was in my room alone when a very bright light came through my bedroom window and shown a very bright reflection in my dresser mirror.  It was so bright that the entire room was eliminated with the light.  I just stared at the mirror while a voice talked to me in my head.  I an only remember the last thing they asked me.  I wasn't suppose to tell anyone about their visiting me.  If I told anyone they would come back for me.  I was scared stiff.  As my room turned back to the darkness of night,  I ran to my parents room and woke them.  Told them what had happened.  Of course my Dad thought I had a fever or something.  Mother told him no.  She feels normal.  That was the only time in my life I slept in the bed with my Mom.  Dad finished the night in my bed.  I never have been a lier, so I'm not starting here.   I have another time when my father woke me on an early Sunday Morning when I was 14 years old.  He and my little sister all jumped in his car and he took us about 3/4 of a block away from our house, and you could see a strange object hovering over the apartment complex's parking lot.  It just sat there.  Wasn't moving.   We decided to drive around the other side of the complex to get a closer look at it, but when we got to the better spot it was gone.  Nowhere in sight.  When we first saw it we were about 500 yards away.  The top of it was rounded and it appeared to be gray or silver with a checker board looking pattern on the bottom half, the top half was solid in color.  The bottom half was shaped like a wedge with the bottom 1/4 cut off to a flat looking bottom.  In all honesty it was not a hot air balloon.  We all agreed on that.  It vanished so fast that there was no possible way it could have been a balloon.   We never did hear anything from any other people about seeing it.  I just thought I would post this after coming upon you site by pure chance.  I have often wondered if other people have had experiences like mine.",

It was very high, I would now estimate that it was 75 to 90 degrees high, and had no contrail, no sign of movement.   It's hard to estimate how long it was, as it was very high.

Oct. 10th to let dogs go to bathroom.  Neighbors dog barking on the east side of my house, looked in that direction and noticed a large boomerang formation between 5,000 - 7,000 ft. altitude, 45 degrees above the east horizon about 300+ yard across.  Moving from north to south along Beltway 8 corridor from Westheimer to Hwy 59 south before I lost sight.  Clear night.  No sound.  At first thought it may be one large single object but as it moved along, noticed some of the 20+ lights moved out of formation slightly so figured they were independent objects moving in formation like a flock of geese.  Having seen geese migrate all my life, quickly ruled this out.  Lights had an orangish/yellowish tint but seemed to be slightly fuzzy.  When the formation moved in front of the stars, the stars would obscure slightly but still be visible so that is also why I believe it to be multiple objects.  I have extensive knowledge of aircraft and know when I am looking at a plane, helicopter, meteor, or satellite in orbit.   Looking from my back yard to the south I can observe approaching aircraft from the west into Hobby airport, but this thing came from north to south and I first observed looking due east.   It made me think, \u201cPhoenix Lights\u201d when I thought about it later because of the boomerang/wedge shape and the color and it being right over the forth largest metro area in the country.   I have no doubt other people in the city probably saw this but just wrote it off as something ordinary.  In fact the only reason I am posting this here and on MUFON is so if anyone else in town saw it and is curiously searching and reads this, knows it was something very unusual and was real.

It just kept hovering on top of the trees that were there.  It just kept moving along that area.  Then what I believe why it left its that my cousin started flashing the cars light at it.  Then it started to move towards us then all of the sudden went higher and moved to another direction we followed it for a mile. It just flew over hwy 290 and we stopped.  It was already high and we could barely see it if it wasn\u2019t for the green lights that keep turning on and of. And all of the sudden it moved in a circle and in a blink of an eye it just disappeared.  I have never seen anything move that fast.

      "story": "Large dark object hovering east to west over Houston Suburbs. I was relaxing in my friend's backyard while looking at orions belt and other obvious formations as Houston is too bright to see very much else. Suddenly I noticed something moving in the middle of where I was looking. It was not obvious at all as it was not emitting any light at all. The only way I was able to see it was due to the fact that the moon was pretty bright that night and the shadow underneath this object provided just enough contrast to see it. It was travelling east to west and held a steady speed comparable to a helicopter. It looked either relatively close (like a helicopter) or very huge. Really, it seemed both big and close. It is hard to tell with no light coming from it though. Either way it would have been close enough to hear if it was a helicopter or airplane or anything with an engine. The shape was large and seemed round. It was absolutely silent and gave me a very creepy feeling. It was dare I say it...camoflauged against the night's sky. I looked away a few times to make sure it wasn't a spot on my eye or something in my head and found it everytime I came back to it. I called my friend over after I could make some words out. He didn't get up in time and it was hard to make out if you weren't watching it the whole time. I then lost it behind an unavoidable tree blocking our view. I never saw it come out the other side either. If I had to make a guess as to it's path it seemed close enough and travelling in the right direction  to be generally following or flying over the bayou. Which would be a very discrete path to take for any object trying to hide. It left me shaken really as I knew something was flying low and big and silent and dark as the sky. It was pure luck I was practically looking at it as it crossed my eye while watching stars. I am not sure as to when this day was exactly as I forgot to post here. But it was last year before it got really cold. Maybe October instead of Sept. I would like to be contacted by e-mail to see what you guys think and if you've ever gotten reports of things dark with no lights as I don't see many.

We were still trying to unpack our room so I slept on floor and stared out my window for awhile.  After about 30 minutes a huge white orb came over the window.  The orb itself was incredibly bright but it cast no light around it.  It seamed very low because it so large, it filled my entire view coming over the house and flew past the window.  It gave off the sound of a very deep sounding yell.  The sound was pretty quite but still unmistakable that the orb was making it. It was way to large for a plane and it was almost like a perfect circle.  The bottom drooped down.  It flew very slowly over the house, stopping for only a second a little past the window.  It sped up almost suddenly, then slowed back to its original speed, like it  re-thought its movements. The object then flew perfectly strait and level in the direction of north.",

It was the summer of 1968 in the middle of the day, bright sunshine and very hot and humid as Houston is known to be, we lived on Telephone Rd.  I remember waking up in my bed and thinking \u201cwhy am I taking a nap?\u201d  I get up and go to my parents\u2019 room, they are both asleep on the bed, sun is coming in through the windows, and I can not wake them up.  I go out the front door and proceed down the driveway, it is deathly quiet, no birds, no cars, no planes, nothing is moving anywhere.  As I get almost to the end of our driveway I hear an unusual humming noise.  I see a disk shaped object floating over the roof of our neighbors house, it is, I would approximate, 6 feet in diameter and is big enough for 1 occupant, it has a glass dome and is a brushed silver color.  There is a humanoid in the UFO; he appears to be driving it with a \u201cjoy stick\u201d. He is a dark greenish gray color and I remember thinking \"was that his skin or a body suit?\", he also has on goggle type glasses very round and thick. I am frozen at the end of our driveway, terrified.  He does not see me at first.  He progresses over the neighbors\u2019 yard and crosses our street.  Suddenly \u201che\u201d jerks his head around to the left and looks directly at me.  I become paralyzed and fall off the driveway into the little ditch that boarders the road.  I can still see but cannot move.  The next thing I remember is waking back up in my bed.  The little TV in my room is on and has only \u201csnow\u201d on the screen.  I scream \u201cthey are in the TV, they are in the TV!\u201d I grab the electric cord to the television and pull it out of the socket and keep pulling until the TV falls off the dresser and breaks, much to my relief.  This wakes my father from his \u201cSleep\u201d and he comes in and spanks me for breaking the TV. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

It was then that I first found myself just inches from the leaves at the bottom of the pool, and while I was looking at them gently swaying back and fourth, it gave me a feeling of calm and peace. and then all at once, I was flying over a city, and could feel vast amounts of information flowing into my being, not my mind.  At the time my mother had come out looking for me but did not see me, and after some time had past, I was back on the edge of the diving board. Where my mother had come running out and was yelling at me to get off of the diving board. I remember her also yelling at me and asking me where did I go.

As I looked at the moon and the stars, as I do everynight, off to my right, just above the treeline, there was a bright greenish/blue flash.  Honestly as I caught the tail end of it, my first thought was, someone had set of some fireworks, even though there was no noise, and I just caught the cast off falling to the ground.  While looking at this spot in the sky, to hopefully see the next flash as it happened, another flash appeared to the left in the sky, I turned to look at it, but it was gone, then right in front of me again above the treeline, another flash, and then again to the right, yet another.  Whatever this was, it moved so fast that I couldn't keep up.  I never once got to actually look right at it.  It was the most beautiful light, and I have been looking for it to happen again the last few nights, but nothing.  If anyone saw this, over the Clear Lake area, please confirm that I don't just have some tumor that was rapid firing in my brain.  Thanks, anyone with ideas of what it was would be nice as well.",

      "story": "Gray egg shaped object with many colored lights flying low in the sky, then either vanishing or flying away very quickly. I am a graphic designer, age 30. The other witness is my girlfriend, a paralegal, age 23. We were driving to our 7:30 dinner reservation, which we were late for, and as I was going along my street I saw a bright star off to my left. I'm always looking out for ufos so I made some comment about this star to my girlfriend, and she replied to stop looking at it and look where I was driving.  At the next intersection I turned left, and now the object was in the sky in front of us (and slightly left of the road). The light had grown and now it was no longer a star, but many blinking lights. Its altitude in the sky was much lower than a plane, maybe between 500 and 1000 feet up. My first thought was \"Damn that thing has lots of lights\" but I actually wrote it off as a plane because my eyesight is poor and I couldn't see any detail. Then a few seconds later my girlfriend (whose eyesight is better than mine) said \"What IS that thing?\" I looked over at it again and I asked her to tell me what she was seeing. She could actually see the solid object and said it was grey and egg shaped, and covered with blinking lights. It was flying about as fast as a plane or a helicopter, but erratically. I could see the blinking lights, which were multicolored (there were at least a dozen lights to my reckoning), but my eyesight was not good enough to discern the shape.  By this time it had flown further to our left. I said \"screw the reservation!\" and I took the next left to follow it. The trees obscured our view temporarily but I drove in the direction that it was in the sky. As soon as we got to a clearer view, the object was nowhere to be seen. We were both very baffled, because it should've been visible in the sky.",

      "story": "three changing color groups of lights hovering over rooftops I was awakened this morning about 5:40 am here in west Houston by my 17 year old daughter who was up early for school. She was sitting eating breakfast and happened to notice a strange light out the back window. She said she watched it, got her sister (15), and witnessed three distinct groups of lights hovering over the rooftops in the distance. They said they could see a dark object in the center of one, but two were just hovering as changing colored lights (at different heights),  That's when they woke me. I ran outside to see and confirmed two of these objects. At an arms length I'd say they were about the size of an aspirin or peanut.  Fairly large and distinct with 4 or 5 lights making up a cross or diamond shape.  The lights were pulsating and changing colors: red, green, blue, white, turquoise.  They were hovering at different heights above the rooftops of the next neighborhood.  One was very low, just barely over the rooftops, the other about twice the height of the homes below. I went in to get my astronomical telescope to see if I could zero in on it. While I was trying to sight it, the one I was watching reduced in size, turned orange and began to move to my right. I followed it around to the front of my house and watched it slowly move parallel to the ground just above the rooftops until it disappeared behind homes. The other light was gone when I looked back. My daughter tried to film it, but could not get it focused due to palm fronds interfering with autofocus. However, you can see the two objects and the colors that they were cycling through. We don't know, of course, what it was, but the two objects I saw were silent. About twenty minutes later I went back outside and saw an aircraft approaching from a different part of the horizon and could clearly hear that it was a helicopter.  So I use that in contrast to the silence of the first sighting. The night sky was clear, but moonless, so it was very dark.",

We ran to the edge of the forest to see what was happening, and from somewhere in the middle, a large round disk, about 300 yards away rose up and sped off in the opposite direction (south). The bottom of it was mezmerizing, like a light show. A large blue light in the center of it moved around in a spiral toward the outer edges; and the object was outlined in a flashing changing color light. The next day, we followed one of our trails to where the object had been. What we founfd was unbelivable. A 40ft by 40ft area of the forest, in the shape of a circle, had no leaves at all. None were on the ground, and there were no plants. And all around the area lush greens leaves were everywhere. The trees were untouched, no branch was out of place. The end. P.S.

      "story": "Colored spheres fly over Houston Texas! On this night i saw two seperate objects. The first one caught my eye as it flew directly over me at an unknown altitude. I live about eight miles from IAH airport. I watch the planes as they take off and land on a nightly bases. If i had to estimate the the speed and altitude, I would say they were about the same altitude as the planes as they fly over, but moving at a higher speed about double the speed of the planes as they take off. Moving from south to north this object flew directly over me and was straight above me when i noticed it. It was a pinkish orange in color, appeared to be spherical in shape although it also seemed to have more of a globular shape. The color was strange because Ive never seen a object this color. Almost as if it was a thick translucent color. Completly silent as it moved at a steady speed until it vanished into the horizon. As i stood there trying to figure out what that was. A few minutes later another one came into view moving at about the same altitude and speed as the first one. This second one was a little darker in color more of an orangish red. Moving this time from east to west. Now a person could say that since i live close to the airport that they were planes. These were not planes! They were completly silent, They were of a solid color by that i mean they were not flashing or strobing like the planes do. And these were not just lights either. You could actually see a a shape, almost as if they were lit from the interior with no exterior lighting.",

The light was white, slightly larger than a bright planet.  I first noticed the light stationery or virtually stationery in the sky for a few seconds. I assumed that it was a star, planet, or perhaps an aircraft moving straight toward me, and appearing to be mostly stationery. Nothing about its appearance at this point was especially noteworthy.  Then, suddenly, from its stationery point in the sky, the object appeared to drop rapidly straight toward the horizon. The object appeared to simply fall from the sky. It moved far more rapidly than any conventional aircraft could have moved.  Simply stated, it looked like a very bright star that came unstuck from the fabric of the sky and fell downward. It was quite a remarkable sight. I saw it clearly and I am certain that I am not mistaken about what I saw.  As it fell, my view of the object was occluded by buildings closer to the horizon.  Since I had clearly seen it stationery, I am certain that it was not a shooting star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

From the North-West, I noticed a bright white light in the distance. I thought it odd, because the light was much brighter than one would expect for an airplane. I kept watching the light aproaching while slowly moving through traffic.  It seemed to be moving slowly and on a level path to go directly over the Interstate. As it aproached I noticed it was more than one light. It apeared to be 5-6 lights in a row and the were pulsing in a left to right pattern.  At this time I looked around to see if anyone else was observing and several drivers around me were also looking in that direction and pointing, to show their passengers the lights. By now it was getting fairly close to where I was located and I could make out more definition of the lights.  The lights apeared to be circulating around whatever object was. I could not definately make out a shape, due to the highway lights and the orientation of the object to my vehicle. The lights were not only white, but seemed to posess an irridecent color shifting quality, with different hues of red, blue and possibly yellow.  As the craft passed over, and behind my car, I rolled down the window to see if I could identify what it was. Unfortunately, the angle of the crafts travel took it at an akward angle that I could not see, due to the fact that I was still trying to drive and watch traffic.  I did not notice any sound, though there may have been. With many cars around me traffic possibly would have drown out any noise the craft was making.  I am not sure what I saw, but it was unlike anything I had seen in the past. I am interested in finding out if anyone esle present on the interstate that evening will report it here.",

On the evening of June 10, 2008, at aprox. 10:30 pm, as I was out with my dogs in the front yard of our home, I witnessed a large, bright white light moving across the suburban Houston, Texas sky from the northwest, heading into the southeast, at a level of about a mile or so high. This object did not display ANY sort of a tell-tale sign of any know aircraft to our American skies (i.e. no blinking lights, no red or green lights, nothing). The object was not moving very quickly, but at a steady pace across the night sky  I quickly ran inside to get my wife to witness this event. She in turn came out to the yard and also observed the light as I have described. The object took about a minute to cross the sky above us, so it was not even moving as fast as the planes that do cross our skies daily. As we both watched, hoping that this object would display SOMETHING to let us know that it was man made, we observed the object become a bit brighter in the sky, and then with the blink of an eye, it was gone.  We both turned and looked at each other in disbelief, and both of us said almost simultaneously, \u201cIt made no sound.\u201d As we were watching the object go across the sky, I even made a small comment out loud: \u201cI don\u2019t hear any engines. If it\u2019s a plane, we should be able to hear the sound of the engines.\u201d There was NO SOUND.  My wife was a bit shocked and perplexed, as she has not had any \u201cencounters\u201d that she has ever told me of. For me, this was one of many \u201csightings\u201d that I have witnessed above the Houston skies. Nothing that truly warranted a report\u2026until now.",

As I looked, it seemed to have different colors as it blinked. I also noticed that it didn't look hazy as if it were blinking from clouds passing by. My brother and my girlfriend came out, saw the same thing, but we all thought it could possibly be an airplane. After about 5 min or so, the light was still in the same place in the sky, not seeming to get closer or further away. It looked extremely far away (remember, I compared it to a star at first, so I'd say it was some miles away). We got some very cheap binoculars and looked at it again. At that point, all 4 of us that were there all saw the same thing. The light was moving around very fast, not seeming to be traveling anywhere, but just dancing around all different patterns in the same vicinity. The light was also not just red and green, but all different colors, constantly changing. I noticed that while I was watching, 2 planes flew by, about 3 min apart from each other, but they didn't go anywhere near the object or even in its direction. It was still there when my girlfriend and I left, which was a few minutes after 11pm. I wish I could see that direction from my apartment, but I can't because of the buildings.",

I believe I have had a UFO sighting on this date, Friday, January 11, 2008, at approximately 9:00pm.  I was outside with my brother playing Frisbee golf while we walked his dog.  As he was explaining the basis of the next hole and I couldn\u2019t pay attention to his words; all I could do was look at the sky.  Normally in the city you\u2019re lucky to see a handful of stars and the only constellation you can ever count on is Orion\u2019s belt.  Tonight though, outside of my brother\u2019s apartment, I couldn\u2019t help but stare at the sky in amazement. I don\u2019t know if it was the clear sky or my brother\u2019s neighborhood but the sheer magnitude and number of stars was breathtaking.  As I was scanning the sky I noticed the odd triangular shaped light forms.  They were moving quickly, faster than the planes.  They were so low and clear and as I tried to keep my eyes on them they jetted through the sky and disappeared. The whole time I kept shouting at my brother to look at them but they were moving so fast that he was never able to fix his eyes on them.  The three lights just totally disappeared.  I ran down the block looking for them, but they were gone.  I stayed outside scanning the sky for ten minutes after, looking for the lights or anything that I might have mistaken this spectacle to be.  I can\u2019t think of any other explanation for it. It was three triangular light forms, flying in formation.  They hovered for a tiny bit, which is when I spotted them.  Intrigued and confused by what I saw, my eyes followed the shaped as they sped through the sky.  I tried to absorb as much as I could about them before they disappeared.  Each triangular formation was actually composed of smaller lights creating the triangular form.  They moved together perfectly and quickly and I know they weren't planes because I could see planes moving in the vicinity.  It almost seemed like they were chasing the formation; it was amazing.",

So i guess she couldn't focus on it.   Two things that seemed odd about this UFO was that no noise, it looked almost like a see through shadow.. Oval-shaped and at the least, i could tell its shaped was horizontally stretched more that its vertical stretch.  I was standing there in amazement for about 20 minutes after that just peering in the sky, just trying to see if i could get anouther look.. the circumstances did allow because as soo as it flew from the smaller could to the bigger one, it gott abit hazey as its shape ever so slightly kept almost poking in and out of the cloud.

      "story": "Two cylinder like objects Mr. Davenport, I was simply playing with my Nikon 5.0 Mega pixel digital camera and caught two objects while I was inside my vehicle--taken through the front windshield of my vehicle while I was parked and facing east.  These two objects are above the back of the red stop sign (in the picture I will send you).  These objects are probably just balloons.  Using Microsoft Photo Editor, images on my computer automatically come up at 25%--however, one cannot see these images at 25%.  I then clicked enlargement up to 50% and saw two distinct objects above the back of the red stop sign.  (I did not, nor could not see these objects at all when I took this picture yesterday).  Probably just balloons, but since this picture was taken at 4:53 pm, and it would be dark in one hour, why is the, \"balloon,\" dark in the center?  I played with the gamma correction, and noticed these, \"balloons,\" were dark in the center and had a (white) structure at the top and bottom roughly in the form of a cylinder.  So if I am looking east, and the sun is setting behind me in the west, why are the balloons dark in the center?  It was an overcast day, so maybe this explains it, but I don\u2019t see how.  Maybe balloons simply look like this--I have never photographed balloons.  I will now attempt to send this picture.  However, if it requires Microsoft Outlook, my computer is having major problems with this program, and I will not be able to send it this way.  I can only send it through my yahoo address as an attachment.  If this photo is of any interest, please contact me before publishing.  Regards",

EVERY star in the sky was white, white maybe a bluish twinkle to it. this was just red blinking light. but it was so tiny to see, i was thinking maybe it was mars, i know thats red, and maybe the atmosphere made the \"blinking\" just much more apparent. after 10 minutes of wondering what it was, i remembered my video camera.  i am an aviation minded person, and i live near BUSH (hobby) airport. i know what an airliner looks like at 40 k, at night....this was MUCH higher. what i did notice about what i saw, was how it moved...but so slow, that i couldn't recognize it at first. the only way was to use reference points on the horizon (my house) over time. when i noticed it didn't follow the same path as the rest of the stars, i started to doubt myself. at first it was moving towards a solo star in the southwestern side of the sky. minutes later, checking my same reference points. it had moved away considerably from the solo star. it also  had two smaller items that were emitted. they were bright white, floated around the \"red blinker\", back and forth a few times, then rejoined. this happened twice. (but not caught on film.)  with the camera, i could then tell it was TWO rapid strobes next to each other going off. but, it also emitted green color as well. it was a third color, but not a third \"bulb\"  so both lights went from red to white, and sometimes green. but it was FAST!! like hyper speed Morse code...  the thing disappeared to my naked eye, but i could still hold it on the camcorder. but it was fading. it didn't \"go below the horizon\" it didn't \"take off like a rocket, in some direction..it just FADED...not like an aircraft going over a large distance.i searched for another ten minutes. couldn't find it again.  have 30 minutes of footage (roughly 10 minutes actual, on and off). have no idea what it is.  here is a quick video that i did for an onlinde aviation forum . this is heavily cut just for \"quick and dirty purpsoses\" to see if they have any idea. i have no clue what it is, the way things are these days, its hard to tell, so i try not to speculate...it is what it is.

Then white flash explosion Around 11:30pm Thursday night, I went outside to take out the trash and walk my dog (live in an apartment complex with a wooded area next to it).   Usually I look up at the night sky when im on my nightly dog walking trip, just in case something happens to fly by.  Usually I might catch a shooting star, or an airplane but nothing out of the ordinary.  But this night, it seems I looked up at exactly the right time.  When I looked up, a falling spherical object caught my eye.  It was a whitish-blue and looked to have yellowish sparks as a kind of \"tail.\"  It just kinda appeared mid-air (well out of \"thin air\" I guess you could say), not very high in the sky. I tried to follow it to see if it would make contact with the ground, but when it fell behind the treeline of the wooded area next to my apartments (beyond my line of vision, hindered by the trees) there was just a bright white flash, as if it had exploded.  There was no sound or anything though.  Not sure what it was...could have been some kind of falling space junk or just a small meteorite.  Unfortunatly I didnt have my digital camera at the time, or else I could have taken a picture.",

      "story": "small black object seen over IAH airport during thunderstorm flying from the NW to the SE while airport was shutdown for weather During a massive thunderstorm build up over Houston IAH Airport I was standing with 2 other airline employees on the top of terminal A's parking garage out of curiousity, watching the incredibly beautiful cloud formation and intense green blue colors of the thunderstorm.  I noticed, over the nearby parallel north-south runways, a very small black object moving in a straight line under the clouds going in a direction from northwest to southeast ..perhaps at an altitude of 1000 to 2000 feet...its speed was that of a slow moving airplane not a jet...but not as slow as a bird...The winds were gusting to 35mph which I had checked on our company's weather information page prior to taking the elevator to the top floor of the building and the airport was closed at this time for takeoffs and landings. The clouds were literally swirling in 3 directions overhead and windshear must have been pretty strong  ...all air traffic on the ramp had come to a halt and no planes were landing.  This object was big enough to be noticeable but too small to determine the exact shape which was so frustrating though I want to say that it did not look aerodynamic for some reason.  There was no wing flapping motion and even though one of my friends told me it had to be a bird, I'm not certain a bird could hold it course going through a severe thunderstorm without being tossed around or altering its flight path . I would think at this point it would be blown all over the place as even we were being buffeted and pushed around by the winds. Nor could a bird traverse the entire airport In 1 minute as it had crossed the field in a straight line neither moving up or down and as it traversed the airport going south east I could see that the object neither moved to the right or left but continued on this straight axis to the end of the cloud build up....possibly 2 miles away then swung up at the end of the cloud bank and went into the upper clouds in an extreme parabolic path....its flight path was neither typical of a bird or a plane. 1 thing was puzzling and that was even when it was at its closest to terminal A we could not make out its shape yet even when it was far away we could still see the black object....",

I was standing at that bank of windows when, to my north-east, I saw two oval objects seem to rise together out of the trees in a nearby neighborhood. What impressed me were two things:  1. The difference in altitude remained very constant. The forward-aft distance changed slightly, but they seemed fixed to each other in altitude from each other.  2. Both objects looked identical, but with variations in color/configuration. These changes were seen in unison.  Also, we have a lot of traffic to and from Ellington airfield, including formation flights of the local Air National Guard. These were most definitely F-16's as the ANG unit uses, and their relative position/speed was much slower than that of any plane at the apparent alititude.  As for a description of the objects:  1. Somewhat oval in shape with possibly points to the side. 2. The main bulk was white, the bottom black, and some red on the top surface. The shape and relative proportion of these features changed periodically during it's visibility to me.  I watched the objects transit from their position along a rough vector west to possibly north-west. After Two minutes, the objects passed beyond the corner of the building. I was not able to re-aquire the objects in view after that.  One more side note, probably coincidental: I saw flying along the same basic vector, shortly after the objects were obscured from my view, a small aircraft, possibly a helicopter. It was moving much faster than the two previous objects.",

I was walking on the sidewalk outside my apt. behind Sharpstown Mall, after getting off work as a LPN in the long term care facility 2 block's down the road, between midnite & 1a.m. For unknown reason's I \"felt\" to look over my shoulder & upward towards the east, where I was literally, in awe at what I saw there. 1st noticed an extremely gigantic size dark object approaching very low, moving very slow, appeared as a giant V shape, as it came more directly over my head, going in an east to west direction. I noticed the underside of the object to appear like rippling dark black liquid motion. As the object continued slowly gliding overhead, I realized it was so huge it blocked out my entire vision of any sky, this object appeared so much larger than my apt. complex, the street, the apt. complex across the street. And at this time, I also realized, the object was completely silent. I also recall like diffuse lighting to the underside, from possibly within, tho ! no light's actually on the outer surfaces. I recall, as the object's backend glided over me, I then observed the solid appearing structure around the outer perimeter of this Chevron shaped object, as I can recall it is best described as, from my only experienc's, as girder structural design. I will admit I've alway's believed in the existance of extraterresterial intelligence, & have read a great many book's on the subject, that is probably why I've only tried to tell a few people of this experience back then when it happened, but, I stopped talking about it, because I was ridiculed by everyone, & still am today by my boyfriend of 9yrs. But, I've alway's had the strong feeling's that I should pursue telling my story, regardless of what other's say or think, & that is why now I'm writing, because in my heart I KNOW WHAT I SAW! I may not know what it was, but, I definitely know I saw it. And can honestly say, that thru-out the entire experience, I felt no fear, I was calm, & ! fully aware to, as accurately as I was able, observe & mentall! y record all I could of this event.

      "story": "Strange object over Houston, Texas (midtown) on June 18, 2009 At roughly 10:00PM last night I stepped out onto my 3rd story balcony to have a cigarette.  I happened to look up into the sky as I usually do and noticed an odd shaped object moving from South to North at a fast pace. I wouldn\u2019t be able to give an actual figure as far as it\u2019s height off of the ground mostly because it was a densely dark object. One thing that intrigued me is that it was running silent and had no blinking lights whatsoever. Also, due to the fact that it was dark, it was fairly invisible in the night sky. The only reason I was able to notice it and distinguish its shape (fairly triangular) was because it flew just under some glowing night-time clouds. It flew right through a known air traffic lane. So soon after it passed the clouds it became invisible once more and then a passenger aircraft flew through the same airspace at approximately the same altitude, which allowed me to guess its size as roughly that of a large truck. It all happened very fast.  It was a partly cloudy night, so had it not been for the small cloud it passed under I would guess that I wouldn\u2019t have noticed it at all.",

      "story": "Multiple UFO Sightings Houston, Texas I was sitting outside with a friend when we notice a police helicopter circling around us (it continued to do so for about 10min.) Then we saw a triangular craft with a bright white light in the middle with smaller lights throughout the craft. I could pefectly see the shape of it. It was moving slowly and ackwardly and moved out of sight. Then we saw what was the shape of a twin rotor army helicopter, but it was making a low drone noise and had two very bright red lights. When one light blinked the other would go out and visa versa. On this one, it could just have been an army helicopter. But, the lights were really strong...not the normal airplane/helicopter light. Either way, why would there just be one flying relatively low to the ground? Then 10-20min. later we saw another triangular craft like the one before, but it soon disappeared. And about 5min. after that we saw the strangest thing yet. A group of blinking lights that were blinking really excitedly. Going from dim to dark as they blinked. And it would jump from one place to another and make really weird flight patterns. Sometimes it would go dim and then go really bright and go up and down really fast and then appear somewhere else. (I have a short video of it where you can see it jump, but at this point the ship had stopped blinking. Where do I send the video?) Then it started turning left then right in a smooth zig zag type of pattern. It seemed to have a shape while it was turning, but it's hard to explain the shape. I'd say it's closest to the \"chevron\"sign. We also saw a bright white orbish object flying around it for a little bit. Then it started moving back and forth, then disappeared. It's been a crazy night.",

I noticed that your website has other reports that you are tentatively classifing as Venus & Sirius, but they are not.  They are both UFO's, or UFO docking stations of some kind. One is the bright starlike object in front of our view of Venus. The other is the bright starlike object in front of our view of Sirius.    As one who has always been a sky watcher, and who takes photos daily & nightly, I know what I am seeing.    These objects are at lower altitude than a planet, or star, and block our view of these natural objects. I've been watching & photographing them for months. Description:   The SW object changes shapes which can be seen visually, and the lights appear to change colors.  It also seems to react to being photographed with more light pulses, brightening.  The object in front of Sirius shows the same characteristics. Both followed the natural path of Venus and Sirius across the night time sky.  If you get a camera on them, they are no further up than the usual low altitude UFO's that glide above many of our neighborhoods at night.   I would estimate the faux Venus object to be about 1 mile up, at most.  The faux Sirius object is probably 1 1/2 to 2 miles up, judging by it's size when video'd. This west side of Houston is a little known hot spot, with activity most days & nights when the weather is good. I will include video links at the email address you have provided that include photos, both original and enhanced to bring out the detail. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We disagree with much of what is written above.  We believe we are fairly adept at identifying reports of both Venus and Sirius.  We do not know what a \"UFO docking station\" station is, but we would like to see a photograph of such an object.

      "story": "Family has had several encounters over years with possible explanations regarding agenda, bovine blood use, and bdellium collection. You asked me on the phone why I waited so long to report my experiences to anyone.  In actuality I have shared my experiences with family members and friends for years, but not until recently did I think that anything that I had to share would be relevant or of any importance or interest to an official UFO investigative or reporting agency. In recent months there have been several televised reports: UFO Hunters, UFO Files, etc. on television that I have watched that have convinced me to pass on some information that may help.  I am not writing for any recognition or monetary gain.  However, I am willing to take any type of lie detector test, medical test that you or someone else may want me to submit to, in order to verify any information I am sharing with you now or in the future. 1.) I have been in the medical laboratory field just short of 20 years, so you will be able to appreciate my confusion while I was watching a report on cattle mutilations when a prominent doctor (omitted name per your instruction) said, \"I am not aware of that many similarities between bovine blood and human blood.\"  Either this is a doctor I would never want to go to or he was telling a boldfaced lie. In the laboratory there are several types of automated pieces of equipment to analyze everything from thyroid function to bacterial infections and STD\u2019s.  All of these machines need to be calibrated with positive and negative controls, nearly ALL of which are made out of bovine blood, BECAUSE IT IS SO SIMILAR TO HUMAN BLOOD. While working for one of the top DNA and GENETICS companies in the US, nearly all of our research incorporated the use of bovine blood, because of the similarities. 2.)  During one of my dad\u2019s encounters with, for lack of better words, the aliens, he asked them why they were here.  The answer he received was that they are here to harvest our planet\u2019s abundant resource of bdellium and its anti-gravitional properties.  Do I know anything about bdellium?  I haven\u2019t got a clue!  But that is the answer my dad got. He was also convinced that their being here was not a good thing for mankind.  He said they had cloaking abilities and that they could be standing right next to you, and you would never know. I had a first hand experience when I was in the backyard playing catch with a friend of mine.  We both saw a bird in mid flight hit what seemed like an invisible wall, make a loud thumping sound, and then it fell dead to the ground. 3.)  From watching one of the episodes of UFO Hunter, they had two men who tested with unusually high ck levels.  If you have any more information on that, I would appreciate receiving it.  I am currently on full disability.  I have had cancer four times and am now struggling with a rare endocrine disease, similar to Addison\u2019s, but I am not responding well to treatment. At some point in my youth I received a straight incision on my backside that I have memories of receiving while surrounded by many \u201cbeings\u201d.  My dad was there.  My mother was not and when I have asked her questions regarding what it is and why I have it, she has no recollection of me ever having an injury there. At the very least, my body seems unusually prone to sickness. I have had several encounters over the years, starting with seeing something in the park on my 8th birthday.  My brothers and I saw a glowing ball of light hovering in front of the screen door while my parents were in Pittsburgh. My older brother was watching us and we were terrified.  All clocks in the house stopped. We moved from Pa. to Ohio, and things continued.  My mom and I were out taking a summer drive and just talking when we saw something flying over us.  It went very fast and kept making abrupt changes in direction.  We looked for a road to turn around on and when we turned into a drive to do that we were stopped by what looked like military guards that ordered us to stop and get out of there.  My mom explained that was exactly what she had intended to do anyway. As recently as this year I watched a very large whatever go over the house here in Tx.  It wasn't like you could see it.  It blocked out things as it went overhead.  It was totally dark and totally quiet. There are many more encounters that I could share, but it is not these little incidents that matter.  What I felt I needed to share was the info on the bdellium and the bovine blood.  If it helps, I am glad.  Do I believe we are being visited? Yes.  Do I believe we should trust them? No. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

From the point I had first noticed until we both started inspecting it maybe 5 minutes had elapsed with this object which appeared to be at least 50 feet long and wide hovering in one place but as soon as we both looked closer it appeared to get dimmer until we realized it was because it had left at such an amazing speed that the bright light just appeared to get dimmer. it took off at a 30 degree angle headed directly away from us and up into a completely clear sky until it disappeared from distance.",

I looked in the sky to see four circular lights flying in a square :: formation.  At first I figured it was an airplane until it registered how fast they were going and that there was no noise whatesoever.  I then saw them change formation into what appeared was going to be a V shape formation, but then changed into a diagonal line (from my perspective at least) like so .... but diagonally from left to right. The color of the lights were white/yellowish with a hint of light blue, but were behind a thin layer of clouding so I can't be sure the exact color.  I'm sure it wasn't a commercial aircraft because of how fast it was moving and the fact that the lights moved from their original formation.  I can't rule out that they could have been military craft, however the following is what leads me to believe they are not.  (or at least what military craft are available knowledge to the public.)  1. They made no noise whatsoever.  Not even after they were gone.  There was no trailing engine noise. 2. The speed and seemingly effortless way they manuevered into another formation.  They changed direction faster and more fluently then military aircraft would be able to handle.  As I said earlier, they went from :: to V to a diaganol line .... in a matter of about 5 seconds. 3. The fact that they were just lights... just a circular light.  No flashing, no additional lights, just a solid circle of light. 4. Under a minute later some helicoptors could be heard in the vacinity..  Tho as to whether or not they were there for the spectacle is beside me.  If they were, there would be no way they could have matched the UFOs speed. So that is my sighting.  I personally am convinced they were not commecial or military aircraft.  If the goverment has some black project for new craft and propulsion systems, that is another story.",

I also thought it could be some type of flying camera taking pictures of the area after Hurricane Ike or for some type of internet \"earth map\" because it maintained the same speed and altitude. The object was near the descent pattern for Houston Intercontinental Airport, but it was too slow and was obviously not an airplane, helicopter, or blimp.  The object made no sound as it moved across the sky.  I wanted to go inside and get my camera, but I didn't want to alarm any of the other students.  I also thought the object would be out of view by the time I returned from my classroom.  Only a small crowd gathered to watch the object as the other students played on the playground.  I am skeptical of stories I have read about UFOs, but I did witness an object that is unidentifiable.  Please let me know if there is a logical explanation.",

If you had any reports from Houston last night (July 13 2008) of an object traveling directly northbound, I saw an unidentifiable object. Bare eyes, no scope obviously. Completely circular, traveling straight north. (I am on the west side of houston texas). This object seemed to be uniformly spherical, it seemed to have a glow to it, but not a bright one. But it was a consistently uniform light. The light did not change brightness, did not have any sort of beacon or blinking as a plane or copter would. And It seemed to move from the southern most point of the horizon to the northern most pointin about 10-12 seconds. (this has to be an incredibly fast speed, as planes and jets take many minutes to pass the entire sky. Definitely not a satellite, as they are much slower. And definitely not a meteorite as I have seen many, and they seem to disappear half way across or down the skyline w/ a greenish color. I have been looking to the sky's for many of years for something regardless, and I told my wife, that if i had ever seen a ufo in my life, that last night was it. She just thinks I'm crazy.  Are you the one guy who takes reports from his home in washington or something like that, the guy I saw on tv. I never thought I would contact you thinking I saw an anomaly like this. This is a serious inquiry. (report)",

I noticed two particular \"stars\" that were very near each other.  I saw one start moving to the north in an arc while the other one stayed still.  Then the second \"star\" moved to the west, also in an arc. Due to the trees, I lost the second one behind the high pine trees.  However, my boyfriend followed the first until it faded away. About five minutes later, I spot another moving \"star\" and then the fourth another five minutes after that. I know for a fact that our government does not have aircraft that can fly that high in our atmosphere at a constant high rate speed.  I call them \"stars\" because that is how they looked due to being so high up in the atmosphere. After the moving \"stars\", my boyfriend sees a very bright light.  A light too bright to be a planet. Also, there was no \"twinkling\" to it, but a pulsating light.  We know where Venus is in relation to the moon as well as Mars. Every night, my boyfriend and I watch the skies and wish aloud that there was no light pollution to affect our view.  He went home to tell his family about it and to show them the bright, pulsating \"star\". They too have confirmed that it is \"moving\" across the sky at a faster rate than the Moon, Venus, and the North Star.",

At about 11:05pm I saw lights over a line of trees to my left from inside of my car. I kept driving down the road until the trees to my left ended and I came to an intersection where the traffic light was red. I stopped at the intersection and rolled down my driver side window and I could see the lights traveling horizontally from west to east across the horizon. There were about 20 - 30 lights in the sky traveling in pairs one on top of the other. As they moved across the sky, the pairs would switch spots within the formation (the one on the bottom would move to the top).  When the light turned green, I pulled into a parking lot of a restaurant, which was closed for the night, and continued to watch them move across the sky. I was in the parking lot for about 3 minutes and I decided to keep traveling east on McGregor. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I kept followin! g the lights with my eyes. I came to another intersection and took a left to turn around (to go west on McGregor). While I was waiting for the light to turn green I noticed 7 lights identical to the ones that were traveling across the horizon and saw that they were stationary and in a tight formation. The formation was 3 lines. One line was at a 90 degree angle, and the other 2 at a 45 degree angle, with one on the right and left and they all met in the middle with the other light in the formation. At this point, I called my wife and told her about what I saw. She told me to go pick her up from home because she wanted to see the lights. I picked her up, but once we got there the lights were gone. Traveling home and back took about 20 minutes.

I was at my cousin's wedding in 1977 when my uncle came up to me and said he had a story to tell me.  He said he wanted to tell me because I was a scientist (actually an archaeologist).   He said he had been visiting our family lawyer who had been a judge for many years, in his hospital room a few weeks before he died.  The judge told my uncle that he wanted to tell him something he had never told anybody because of the sensitive nature of the story and his being a past judge and lawyer.   He said he was out dove hunting in the woods with his wife and two friends just before sunset.   He said all of a sudden a large circular shaped object about 60 ' in diameter came over them.   They got scared and got in their jeep and started back to the ranch house.   A cylinder of light came down from the craft that was the same in diameter as the UFO and followed them all the way back to the house.  They never left the circle of light.   Once they arrived at the house, they jumped f! rom the jeep and ran inside.  The craft then came directly over the house.  The light was so intense, it actually came through the roof and ceiling of the house and into the room where they stood.  It hovered over the house for some minutes and then went away. The reason for finally telling this story is that there was no reason for my uncle to lie (he didn't drink at this time), and certainly there was no reason for the judge to make up such a story on his deathbed.  I just thought some one should hear this story. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "We watched a UFO at night through binoculars. I do not recall the exact date, as the sighting was years ago.  It left an indelible impression on me.   I know that it occurred at night over Houston, TX between 1973-1974. We were attending a men\u2019s flag football league game at Memorial Park.  My husband was one of the coaches.  I was seated in a lawn chair watching the game.   I saw what I thought was an airplane crossing the sky, but it suddenly came to a full stop.   I mentioned it to the lady sitting next to me.   She said she had binoculars in the car and would get them. What I saw through her binoculars (and other people there, too) was actually not just one light, but a string of lights.  I do not recall the exact number of lights in a row that I saw, maybe 5-7.  They were close together. My husband was getting exasperated, as the football players all wanted to watch the object through the binoculars. As we watched this object, it appeared to be turning slowly in various directions.   The string of lights would change into a narrow oval, gradually expanding until it became a full circle of lights.   It kept hovering for approximately 45 minutes, continually changing shape from a string of lights, to an oval, and to a full circle, the reversing the direction of turning.   It even turned so that it was completely vertical, with what looked like flares coming from each light, yet it appeared totally stationary in the sky.   There were no colored lights, just bright white ones. All of a sudden, the object ascended in a southwestly direction and was gone within seconds.

Well I\u2019ve always maybe thought there could be something out there, but this experience has truly made me believe. On my way to work I was driving and noticing the particularly beautiful day and it was about 8:20 in the morning as  I crossed the bridge like I\u2019ve done everyday for two years. Now in the area is what is called Ellington Field, which is a sort of airport for NASA and Military use.  I am used to seeing planes and hearing jets fly over. I tend to think of myself one who has my head in the clouds but as I was driving I noticed a particulary shiny flying object. I took a double look (thinking it was a cool looking plane) but it in fact was an all metal low and fast flying object. It was hard to see and I think the only reason I did was because the sun was to the right of me.The object was reflecting the sun light  but like a mirror as well camoflaging  itself with the sky at the same time.  It was flat but round like a disc but it had a small dome on! top and a slightly larger dome on the bottom. It was moving at a very fast speed, but not so fast that the speed Iwas going in my car could not keep up.  Now once I finally reached a red light on the busy morning road, wondering if anyone else was seeing what I was seeing, I fixed my eye on it. So after the light turned green, the speed of the object started to increase until instantly, as if it had known I had discovered it, it vanished like looking like a bright star in the day sky and then gone completely.  I didn\u2019t suffer from any electric disturbances nor did really anyone else driving seem to notice, but I was for sure I had seen something out of the ordinary.",

Suddenly, something caught my attention at my 3 o'clock vision field.I saw what appeared to be \"2\" satellites on a dual trajectory. My 1st thought was \"It's a high flying jet\" .. but after a moment or two, I decided it was travelling way too fast.I did not see any other flashing strobe lights. I was amazed to see 2 satellites in tandem for the fist time. After watching this for a good minute, any doubts I had about it being an airplane evaporated. Suddenly,the 2 lights \"stopped\" in their trajectory \"tracks\". After 4 or 5 seconds, the lights 'went out'...they disappeared simultaneously. The next morning, I asked the cadre instructors \"If a! nyone had heard about a UFO sighted over I 10 last night?\" They said \"No.\" All I can say folks is this: \"I KNOW what I saw...but I still do not know what it was.\"  Thanks for listening.

It was not moving and very close to the airplane, maybe 200 - 300 meters tops.  So I though \"wow we are really close to the ground in thick fog\", then we went through another break in the clouds and I saw the ground around 20,000 feet below.  I'm not aware of any radio towers that tall or big.  It was quite large with the base and 3 spirest was big, probably the sized of a small house (800 - 1200 sq ft) base with 3 long spires sticking out the top (sorta like the San Francisco radio tower).  The spires where about the length of an interstate light pole with other things hanging off of it. It was dark grey like a titanium wedding ring color.  I saw from the time it came to view in the front of the window then I leaned forward! and watched it until we went into new cloud bank. It wasn't moving so it was like flying by a building 15 - 30 seconds.  A few people looked  concerned/confused on the plane and I should have stopped and asked the pilot but in all honesty I was a little bit worried about asking around.  I can assure you it was not an illusion or reflection, it was solid as a rock and not obscured.  It was just like staring at a building as you fly by.  There were no flashing lights or anything like that.  I did try and take a picture but my phone didn't boot in time.",

I was coming from a clinic where I got an x ray of my sternum which showed a damaged lung.  Looking for decent air and water, I wound up at about the end of Wilcrest across highway 6? unless it was 8. I sat awhile facing east I think at a little dead end.  Suddenly I saw one flying disk about the size of an 18 wheeler, but round, glide across my field of vision.  I think it was going north to south.  I didn't hear anything but suddenly there was moisture on my face and I couldn't breathe.  So I opened my window so I could.  There were also miniature \"star balls\" on the ground and one full sized, I think, overhead.  I thought, \"I knew there was something like this.\" I thought I'd been ((sprayed)) on by the frightened star ball.  Don't know.   I left before the disk was out of sight.  I was afraid I would pass out from the sternum-lung pain and left.  Also, I am on a mental disability and I thought if I try to tell anhhhhhhhyone about this, they'll call me crazy and hurt me more.   I went home and went to bed in pain.  I don't know what time it was. It was before I could fall asleep.  The bedroom had windows with transparent curtains and I saw probably a camera with a turquoise light I could see at about the height of a man.  [The disk had a circle of turquoise lights around it's perimeter.]  I don't remember it rotating or anything.  Just gliding.  I think it was friendly but not sure.

At one point, there appeared to be a very low intensity blue light that pulsed from the center of the craft and radiated out towards the tips of the wings. In effect it was as if the light was internal with-in the craft, but, the craft was covered in a smoked glass allowing it to emit and be seen.  The craft appeared to be almost! the color of the sky, similar to a dark-cloud coloration, possibly a light blue, gray or silver hue, but barely discernible from the color of the sky at the time.  The speed at which the object traveled across the sky was at a much higher rate than any of the know aircraft in the sky.  It was traveling from the west-southwest of Houston toward the east-northeast.   Neither myself, nor my sister have ever seen a craft such as this, nor have any idea of what exactly it was.",

I would not be wasting my time filing a report on this if I weren\u2019t sure of what I experienced earlier.  It was strange and weird, and  I just want to let someone know.  I\u2019m in total shock, its too ridiculous and bizarre! This occurred at Houston , Texas,  around 11 pm.   After driving my girlfriend home, and coming back home, I started to look up at the beautiful clear sky. The sky  here in Houston is never clear and you definitely never see so many stars as they were tonight. The beautiful  clear night sky and stars hypnotize my attention for a few seconds . That\u2019s when I saw this/ these object (s). It seemed around 100 or so feet above the sky and it came the north heading south, it cruised over my head and in open space so I got a real great look at it! It seemed like two metallic or dark stealth looking orbs, its pretty crazy because the orbs did not give any light.  The way I saw them was from their shape and a sort of reflection that reflected of the surface of the objects. The objects seemed around 20 -30 feet in diameter and were 20  feet apart in a parallel horizontal way. I at first mistook the objects for a single plane who I thought did not have the lights on (I thought the orbs we! re giant light bulbs on the edge of the wing or something) but I notice the orbs were separated as starts could be seen trough the 20 foot gap between them. That\u2019s when I was like woah, what could that be? I also did not hear any noise, complete silence , which kind of creeped me out. As the objects cruised away , I saw them rotate around each other in a circular pattern.  When I saw that I totally lost it and decided to look down. Thanks for hearing me out, had to tell someone.",

Passenger sights what seems to be a antenna tower with multiple (red, white, blue, green) colored lights high in the distance.  Passenger realizes the source of lights has no tower beneath it. Driver agrees and stops vehicle.  Both occupants of the vehicle realize they are observing a flying vehicle that is directly above the Project Rowhouse community art complex in 3rd Ward Houston.  This realization means the vehicle was at least 90 stories above the art complex.  The driver stops near the intersection (Elgin/Dowling) and observe what appears to be a UFO with the body of a large plane but is thicker and has many uniformed multi colored lights around it. Some lights blink others are static.  The vehicle is also static/ hovering the buildings in 3rd ward. The vehicles surface can be seen due to its flashing lights as dark grey or green/ a muted color. The! re is what appears to be a very long rod, stick or antenna aimed upwards from the center of the UFO. This too has multi colored lights blinking and what the driver and passenger possibly first saw. The UFO also seems to have short wings much like an airplane but shorter/stub like. The bottom of the craft was dark and not visibly detailed.  The UFO did make a humming sound similar to a portable fan running on high speed. The UFO then started moving slowly north while the driver and passenger slowly made a u-turn and pulled out a Cannon 45D camera.  Upon making a turn onto Dowling the site of the UFO was temporarily blinded.  The driver and passenger lost complete sight of the UFO at this point in time. The UFO could not have been a standard plane flying so low and also hovering dangerously over the 3rd Ward community.  The UFO was flying in a very dark and cloudy evening and may have been taking advantage of these clouds to cloak itself. The previous night and those evenings aft! erwards showed clear skies. No photos were taken by passenger ! or drive r because the UFO disappeared within the seconds the car turned on Elgin/Dowling Street.   There where approx. 5 other cars passing by in a predominately quiet intersection.  A young man ridding a bike was approached by the driver and passenger of the car but he recounted no encounter at all. The Passenger also understood that NASA has a headquarters in Houston and that there are military bases in the area. The conclusion could possibly include a military experimental vehicle.",

It did not seem to be flashing or making any form of movement.   After watching it for another 5 minutes or so, I concluded it must be a cell phone or other tower that I had not noticed inspite of it being very high and even though I have lived here for 30 + years.   When I went out later that day, I looked in that direction but there is no such structure where I had seen the lights.  I have looked in that direction several times since and there is nothing there to have caused that light.   I am a very very normal everyday person (retired) and am puzzled and perhaps a tiny bit scared of what I may have seen.  It was not a plane as it was not moving, too large to be a star (at least 10 times bigger than the North star) and way too high up to be a man made structure.

      "story": "UFO hovers over Houston TX, fall 1973. I was at Memorial Park in Houston TX in the evening during autumn 1973, along with my husband, and a group of men and their wives.  The men were playing tag football.  I was sitting in a lawn chair facing due south.  The game had not started and the men were warming up for the game, when I saw what I thought was an airplane flying from east to west in the night sky.  As my eyes tracked it, it suddenly came to a standstill.  I mentioned this to the lady sitting next to me.  She said she had binoculars in her car. She retrieved them, and handed them to me.  When I looked at the object through the binoculars, and discovered it was not just one light, but a string of lights in a horizontal position.  I did not attempt to count the number of them.  As I  and others watched, the object appeared to began turning on its side gradually.  It changed, bit by bit, from a straight string of lights to an oval, and then ultimately to an full circle of lights.  Other people became interested and also watched this phenomenom.  It turned back into a horizontal string of lights, and then moved vertically.  I could see what appeared to be after-flares coming from each light.  The object remained there for approximately 45 minutes moving this way and that, and then suddenly ascended within a matter of a few seconds upward and to the west.  I have prepared a rudimentary illustration with Adobe Photoshop to show how this object revolved, and yet remained in a stationary position over Houston.  I made no report of this at that time.  There was a lot of debunking going on regarding UFOs and I did not care to get involved.  I know what we saw.  Only in the past year did I send a pencil sketch to MUFON.  I received no reply from them.  It has been many years since I watched this UFO in the night sky, but it still stands out clearly as if I had just seen it moments ago.  Other than my husband, I have no recollection of anyone else's name who had been a witness to this event so long ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Driving through Memorial Park, coming home from my son's house after Labor Day, I looked up to see a huge triangular shaped object with various colored lights underneath. It was stationary.  I said to myself, \"What is that?...It must be some kind of light for one of the playing fields out in the park...but where is the pole to hold it up?\"   There was no pole.  As I looked closer I said, \"That cannot be a UFO this close to downtown Houston!\"  I was within about 3 miles of downtown.  The craft was facing downtown, which is east of the park.  Actually, they were pointing east southeast.  I was about the length of a city block inside the 610 Loop on Memorial.  They should have been visible from Loop 610 as well. A few other cars drove by, but none seemed to look up or notice them at all!  I looked around to see if the other cars were weaving or pulling over or pointing out the window.  (And no, I do not drink alcohol. I was totally sober, no drugs, either.)   I saw airplanes casually flying above all five of these UFOs and they were commercial craft...on their way to Hobby Airport.  This is how I knew the UFOs were pretty low in the sky.  The one nearest me was gigantic.  It was big enough that if I extended my arm full length from my body and held the hand flat, it would not have covered the craft completely!  I was on Memorial Drive, and there are no shoulders, but there was an unused left-turn cut out, (unused because it was night time and that part of the park was closed).  I pulled in there, cut the engine, and got out my cell phone to take a photo.  I noticed there were four others above the one larger one, therefore they looked smaller, but they were the same type of craft.  They were all facing downtown Houston, and seemed to be in formation. I rolled down my window to take a photo, and when that was done, the big one was gone.  I felt quite dizzy. I looked through my windshield and the big one had moved laterally to my right.  I felt confused, and then said aloud, \"Oh, they do not want their picture taken.\" I sat there a minute, then I said, \"Well, there is nothing to be done here.\"  And I drove home. When I got home, I sat down and watched TV and then went to bed.  It was not until later the next day I called anyone to tell them what I had seen, though I posted it on FB asking if anyone else had seen five large UFOs over Memorial Park the night before.  No response. About a month or two later, I called my friend, ((female name deleted)), and told her what happened.  I commented that it was so odd that I just went home and didn't tell anyone at first.  I never called the media or the police.  It just didn't occur to me. Niara is an abductee herself, has written about this kind of thing for the Durango Examiner, and she offered to hyphotize me (over the phone) to see what we could find out...if there were more that I was not remembering. So we scheduled something, and she took me into a light trance. There was more that I had not remembered, of course.  I was sucked up out of the car  window and taken away for 28 days, and then returned to my car a few seconds later. (They can traverse/manipulate time, apparently.) I got to see what they looked like. I was taken to another planet. If you believe me and want to learn more, contact me. If you do not believe me, I could not care less.  My intent for reporting this is doing a public service.  I do NOT want any publicity, please. I will talk if you want to contact me.  I can answer more questions.",

It was near downtown around 22:23, on August 5, 2012, I looked out my window and seen 3 red glowing objects going up in a diagonal line. I then went outside to investigate.  I called my husband and son outside to witness what I was seeing. My neighbor then came outside and asked what were those objects in the sky. We pulled out our phones and began recording.  The first 3 objects by that time had formed a line straight up, then one went to the right and they disappeared. Followed by them were more objects coming up the same direction. At first we thought they were flares, but they didn\u2019t burn like flares. They illuminated.  Three were now in the sky formed a line like the previous 3, but then formed a triangle and disappeared.  Three more did the same and they were gone. I\u2019ve been searching the news and the web to see if anything has been reported but haven\u2019t found anything.  So I thought I\u2019d report it here. I and my husband have video footage on my phone. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is reference to a report I already submitted.

I looked again about ten minutes later and the object had progressed several feet eastward and that is when I noticed the pattern of three lights. Facing west, the three objects were positioned with the first light at the 18:00 position, the second light at the 15:00 position and the third light at the 12:00 position. Details on #2. While standing in the same location, I looked northward and noticed the second set of three objects.  These lights were positioned again in the same positions of 18:00, 15:00 and 12 noon. There appeared to be more than one light on each object, possibly red and white. My question is this; are these US machines up there? Monitoring busy city areas? Or are these foreign machines up there monitoring US areas of interest? Are the UFOs and what are they monitoring?  Very strange. There were two of us that saw the same thing.

      "story": "I saw 2 unidentified objects flying at night . I was driving North, on Montrose Boulevard, at approximately 23:20 PM . I crossed the insercetion at Westheimer , and my attention was drawn to the lights , of an incoming aircraft.  The plane's flight path was from the West of Motrose heading roughly Southeast on a Glide Path, for Hobby Airport Houston , Texas, as it's most likely destination. I was watching the inbound aircaft, which I estimate was at an altitude of around 4 or 5 thousand feet, I noticed 2 more objects flying , in parallel formation to eachother , in a direction of South to North , just West of Montrose.  They were at an estimated altitude of 10 to 15 thousand feet.  The night was partly cloudy and the stars were very visible in the background.  The objects were much larger than any star or planetary obect in the background, but far smaller than a full moon. I fairly certain on my estimations of distance and altitude.  The size noted, was maybe 1/20th the diameter of a normal full moon. One aircraft, the most easterly of the 2 , was slightly in the lead. The objects were not moving at an exceptional rate of speed.  They were steady in flight characteristics, on a straight and level flight path. Both were uniform in color, though , the color observed , was a dull reddish orange glow, pointing perpendicular to the ground. The colors and round shape of the orange glow, reminded me of the shape and color of after-burners on a jet, but not as intense. There was a dull outer ring of orange next ring was darker and center of object again a dull orange. It is possible , these were a type of vertical lift for the propulsion system of the aircraft. As I observed the objects maintain a consistent and steady flight path, the trailing object began to slow fade to black.  This did not take more than a few second.  The leading object followed in this fade to black procedure.  At that point neither object could be observed in the sky.  At no point did I ever note any lighting consistent with Civilian or Military Aircraft.  I do note that the area the objects began to fade in was clear of clouds, stars were visible, and was maybe a mile or 2 away , as the bird flies.  The entire episode did not last more than a couple of minutes . ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he struck us as being quite level-headed and objective in his description of his sighting.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.

I didn\u2019t think that you would be interested, but as I listened to you on Coast to Coast I understood that I should write it down. I was walking around 5am to the bus stop to get to my job and I usually took the shortest way to the bus using back door of my back yard. Back of my house was facing the bayou and across of that was just empty space (later on apartments were build there)    As I started to walk I looked at the sky and saw full moon on my left across the bayou over the empty space.  And something felt strange: moon looked reddish and was low, not up in the sky.  And then I looked to the right of me, and there was a real moon in the sky!  I suddenly was scared and run as fast as I could to the bus stop. Next morning I decided to take a long way to the bus stop (it was a different stop and it would take me 10 minutes longer, but I would by walking by houses in the neighborhood).  As I turn to one of the streets I saw a black van parked on the street in front of one of the houses and in near the van I saw 2 tall men standing and watch what I thought several children playing on the front yard; I am nearsighted so it took me sometime when I came near the children to see that it was not children, and either I blocked instantly what those beings look like or it was blocked from me.  I was terrified  from what I saw and I could not even describe it immediately when  I happened.  I started to run (in my mind I heard that they were amused my terror).  I run all the way to the bus. That is my 2 experiences which I want to report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the sightings are approximate.  PD))",

I notice the object, as I was at the top of I-45 over pass going south towards Pearland, TX.  I slowed down to get a closer looked at this object- it was suspended 12\u2019 to 14\u2019 above Dixie Farm Rd.  I looked for cables or something that it could be hanging from, but nothing, it was stationary in sky on its own.   I drove under it and kept going.

It\u2019s funny; I never thought about stopping and calling 911 or take a photo of the object. When, I first saw this object, it looked like a surveillance probe; cylinder with dark windows around the top, the object was 3 to 4 feet in length, approx 10 inches in diameter.    I heard about UFO Probes before, when, I got home I told my wife about what I had saw.   The sky was so clear it would have made a great clear photo\u2026 I called my brother-n-law and told him what I had seen.

We moved to the north side of the city just about 5 to 6 miles south of what became Houston Intercontinental Airport now named Bush.    When I was about 18 or 19, I can\u2019t remember the exact date but I believe the summer of 1973 or 74 a high school buddy and myself were out in the drive way at my next door neighbor looking up at the stars it was a clear night.  It was about an hour or maybe two after sundown.  We took note of a bright light about the size of a star.  Noting that there were no strobes, we figure it to be a satellite.  The house we were at is north of downtown Houston off US 59 at E. Mt Houston east about 2 miles from the 59.  We at first thought it to be Skylab, but noting it was moving from the south heading north and the news media said Skylab would be in a east west travel we figured it a weather satellite.  That worked for us up until it speeded up greatly.  It then went into about 4 or 5 loops then back and forth through the loops it just made and straight up and disappeared into the blackness of space. Total time of sighting was about 5 to 7 seconds from first sighting until it left our sight.  It streaked so fast there was the impression of a light trail.  As it was doing its maneuvers it would go bright to dim giving me the impression of a shape like a coin flashing in the bright sun light.  If it was a disk then at that altitude it had to be huge and it had to have travel hundreds of miles in a matter of seconds.  That date was over 40 years ago but I can still see it, it shook my buddy and my self up.  The first person we tried to tell was my Uncle who snickered at us.  We both decided not to tell anyone.  I have through my life but to a select few.  I have included it in a book I wrote on the subject.  I am by trade a Aircraft mechanic. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

      "story": "Saw colorful lights on these 2 objects that just hovered between my house and a neighbors that flew off into the distance. I got home about a little after 9 pm.  I left my phone in my car so I went back outside to get it.  Not sure why I looked up but when I did.  I saw this object with  lights  hovering in place and then going far into the distance.  I stared at it for awhile as it continued to go into the distance.  I then called  a friend of mine to come ouside that lives with me to see if she could see the same as what I was seeing and she did.  As we were looking at the 1st one.  Another came from the left side and then directly in front of us and hovered again as the other did and continued in the distance with the same lights.  The lights were red, white and green and it appeared to have a long shape from left to right or thats how it appeared.  It was dark already so all I saw was the shape of the lights in a line.  The lights were in a line but from right to left like maybe 5 or 6 lights that faced us. We stared for awhile to make sure it was not a helicopter or plane and it was! not.  The objects appeared between my house and a neighbors house.  No other objects or lights in sight except for the 2 objects we saw.  The objects did not make any noises. Nor did they dart or zip away.  No wobbling. Just flew the same as a plane or helicopter would but was not either one.  What made it different was that they it hovered in place and moved slowly like they wanted us to see them.  I heard no plane sounds nor the sound of the helicopter wings when a helicopter is staying in place.  Nothing could be heard.  This was my sighting.Not sure what it was but it was  no plane or helicpter or jet I have ever seen.  I live close by to Ellington Airforce base and Hobby airport and I am use to seeing planes,jets and helicopters that is not what it was that night.  I went in as the last one was going into the distance.  Went inside to call another witness to come outside withing sec or a min.  When we came out it was gone.",

It was larger than any star or aircraft that were closer.  It seemed to float for several minutes and then got smaller like it was moving away from us and did this very quickly.   All of a sudden it was back in a different spot and did the same thing.  It appeared a third time but this time it moved up and down and then got smaller like it was moving away from us at a very rapid rate much faster than of the airplanes in the sky.

Its head was larger in the cranium, the neck spindly.  I could tell it was reading my mind and since I was pregnant, I was really afraid.  I immediately screamed and jumped out of bed, running into the living room where my husband was watching television.  I've not seen another one of those since.

It was mostly cloudy at the time.  At first the object was a whitish-yellow light like a plane with also a blinking green light.  It later changed to non-blinking green and red lights only, arranged horizontally.  We were looking due west. As experienced birdwatchers,  I got our binoculars for a better look.  It moved more quickly, complexly and unexpectedly than any aircraft I've ever seen.  It dropped and ascended vertically several times, very, very fast.  It moved back and forth horizontally very fast and made several complex turning and arching maneuvers as well.  My girlfriend suspected we might be seeing a \"toy\" remote controlled aircraft.  I didn't think so.  Who would be out on a cloudy night like this in the middle of the week in a residential neighborhood flying planes?  It made no sound.

There is this one bright light that appears in the sky every other night.  I have a feeling it is not a plane or a star because this light tends to move a lot.  It  brights up so bright, that looks like it could be the northern star.  Then all of a sudden the lights get really dim then seconds later it gets really bright, sometimes it turns blue other people have seen this.  It kind of looks like if it has lights on it turning around in circles.  I really have to idea what it could be and I am determined to find out what the bright moving light really is.  About 4 days ago approximately around 8:00 pm , above a tall tree there was this big ball of light that looked like it was falling from the sky but it looked so close.  My boyfriend was with me and as soon as I saw it I told him to look because I wanted to make sure I wasn't seeing anything.  When it appeared it looked as if it was a huge shooting star but couldn't have been because after I seen the big bright light that it flashed it disappeared that's when I told my boyfriend and when he looked up he saw it brighten up again right  when it was passing the tree that I had seen it above.  This isn't the first time I have experienced sightings of weird, strange lights in the sky.    I just really would like for others to know that theres unexplainable lights in the sky.

When I looked up I some some movement in the sky, I thought it was an aircraft since I do see many commercial jets flying over my house at all hours of the day, but there were no flashing lights and the lights were barely visible.  Normally when aircraft fly over the house they fly in a north-south pattern, these lights were moving west to east which was unusual.   The lights were in a triangular shaped formation, it looked to be about seven to nine lights flying in the sky.  The lights moved slowly across the sky, within about 7 seconds they moved behind the tree in my front yard and then disappeared from my vision. \tI was trying to locate the lights again and make sense of what I had seen when my vision again moved above the house to look at the stars in the city night sky.  I then saw another light, this one singular, move from south to north in the sky above my house.  Both of these lights were noticed in the direction of the Orion constellation.",

We noticed a glowing (silver-ish) ball that was going back and forth from one ball to two balls.  Connected like Mickey Mouse ears.  It was just above the tree line.  Hovering.  After about 45 seconds, it disappeared.   Then about 20 seconds later a blinding neon light was coming straight at us.  At first, it looked like headlights.  But it was so bright that it lit up everything like looking through infrared glasses.  It was greenish blue waves that looked hot.  Like how the highway looks on a extremely hot day- kinda wavy.  This light shot straight through my car and passed by the passenger side window.   When I turned to look, everything in the background - the field - the trees were lit up.  And then it was gone.  It happened so fast that I didn't realize I had slammed on my brakes.  An 18 wheeler must have seen it too because he was stopped dead still on the highway too. The reason I'm posting this now is due to my daughter's nightmares.  About a month ago she started having dreams about the incident.  She won't go into detail about them but she has slept with me every night since.  I'm not sure why it started 5 months after we saw this, but she is terrified.  This isn't normal behavior for her.",

The underside of the craft were illuminated by the night light pollution from the city. Altitude estimation 5-10K feet.  Cruising speed unknown, but moving much faster than typical commercial aircraft on approach to Hobby Airport. The craft were black, with a metallic underside - hence the reflection from the city lights. Due to my limited field of vision, I only had a short window to observe (5 seconds).

Behind and above that haul truck was what looked like a very large light falling from the sky.  It was a sphere in shape and very bright.  It was falling at about a 45 degree angle.   I was thinking there was gonna be a loud crash.  Maybe this was a plane or something.  It was only a short distance from the ground, maybe 100 feet.  It disappeared behind a large stockpile.  The light object was about the size of two haul trucks.  There were four other people who saw this from all sides.  The object passed over a large roadway we call tmf2.  Crossed a water area and went just over the hill.  There it disappeared.   No crash, no fire, just disappeared.  It was a solid light with no tail or anything following it and no noise of any kind.

I live on a suburb on the northwest  side of Houston known as the Bear Creek area. I was doing a little cleanup up in my back yard at about 7:30PM this evening and a bright orange light caught my attention as it was approaching from the west in a direction that I usually observe airlines as they pass overhead to land at Houston Intercontinental Airport.  It began to curve to the north and a second orange light appeared paralleling it a little further to the west. These were no ordinary craft.  They were much brighter that the landing lights that we often see on aircraft.  They were solid without any blinking or pulsing normally associated with known aircraft.  They were a color orange that was almost as intense as looking at a welding arc with almost the same sort of sharpness.  Very orange.  The first thing I thought of was all the reports of the orange fireballs that many people have been sighting lately.  These were definitely self directed. Piloted!  They were moving about as fast as a normal aircraft.  I would estimate that they were at about 3 to 4 thousand feet in altitude.  They appeared to be roughly 500 ft apart. They continued to head in a northwesterly direction at about the same altitude paralleling each other  when another one came into view trailing behind the more westerly one at roughly the same distance. They were in a rough 90 degree pattern all moving in the same direction.  All of this transpired within approximately 30 seconds.  At this time I rushed to call my wife and 18 year old son  to see this. They came out quickly to observe what I was seeing and at that time another light appeared further back and  more to the west. At  maybe 800 ft. further back. As we observed all 4 lights they continued to move in a northern direction and began to fade out one by one. They remained the same brightness till within the last 15 seconds or so when they began to fade and then totally disappear. All of this transpired within about 3 minutes before they were totally gone. They all appeared to remain at about the same altitude and speed the entire time. There was no sound heard by any of us. I attempted to bring out a camera to photograph them, however they were to far away to capture them by the time I was able to retrieve one.  I am 58 years old. My father was in the Air Force for 18 years of my life and I have lived on and around many Air Force bases in the U. S. and in Europe. I am very familiar with many different aircraft and the required lighting that they display. These were not at all \u201cnormal\u201d aircraft.  I can also state that my wife, my son and myself have all seen other unexplained craft in the sky at various times in the past, with some that were defiantly not terrestrial. These were some of the most unusual we have ever seen.",

I was driving home from my night shift at the Houston Chronicle, around 1 a.m.  I was on Interstate 10 right where it intersects 610, the night sky was clear, the Houston air disgustingly sick and muggy as usual.  Where those two highways intersect, there is an area of commerce called the Marq\u2019E. While driving, I saw a glowing light in the sky.  The light was neon-green ish in color and nothing else around it. It was more of an orb; the shape resembled a low-hanging star, but there\u2019s no way a star would appear this low.  It was hard to judge exactly how high up in the sky this orb was, and I wasn\u2019t in the position to stop my vehicle to better gauge its positioning from the highway.   Houston drives are horrible, so, all I could do was stare in awe and wonder.  The orb had a luminous glow around it, as the clear Houston sky that held it, showed some of the green rays permeating from it.  Have you ever been on your back in the grass at night just staring up at the sky and admiring the stars?  This is what this orb reminded me of, star gazing.  I gazed, while avoiding not crashing, almost making eye contact with the light.  And then, just like that in the blink of an eye, the orb shot downward, out of view disappearing.

      "story": "A report / video of 7 minutes of an orb spotted & recorded in Houston, Texas. Hello Peter Davenport,   I would like to report a red/orange orb that I recorded for approximately 7 minutes from around 2010.  I need a location to post these videos.  I have filled out numerous form on a plethora of sites with no response and I just heard your program on Jeff Rense from Friday November 20, 2015. I would like for the video to be available for your next program with Jeff & too see if those that have reported these orbs/fireballs are witnessing the same object if possible. The sky was pasty blue (would have been 'blue' if it were not for the chemtrail residue) with some large white clouds.  It was around 5:00 PM.  The winds were blowing from West to East and the orange red orb that I recorded was moving from East to West (so a Chinese lantern could be eliminated).  After moving to the West for about 2 (two) minutes, the object changed direction to North for about 5 (five) minutes. Once the orb stopped directly above me, it stay there for about 4 (minutes) at which time my neck became to sore to look straight up at. If you would like to view the videos please get back in touch with me. Thanks for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

To my left there was a narrow strip of tree lined pasture where cattle graze.  Rising above the trees was a oval shaped green orb that was about 10-15 ft. wide.  At the bottom of the orb was a small red light.  The orb was moving back and forth over the trees.  Since I was the only one traveling on that stretch of the road, I dropped my speed to about 5mph.  I also rolled down my driver side window to get a better look.  I noted that there was no sound and no blinking lights coming from the orb, which made me realize that it was not a helicopter and definitely not an airplane.

This object moved so smoothly across the sky at fast speeds, slowing down, stopping, changing direction and angle effortlessly.  It was taller from top to bottom than it was wide, no wings.  The best was to describe is it was like a fly just smoothly making all the changes in flight pattern.  I saw a commercial air craft in between me and it and could judge distances from sizes of plane and it.  Hair stood up on my neck and I was very scared for the first min when I realized this is not normal and nothing I have ever seen before.

It flew perfectly smoothly and was headed in the general direction of downtown Houston or Ellington Air Force Base about 25 miles away.  Its form was static like a plane and seemed to be gliding at a few hundred feet, or perhaps flying too high to hear.

Driving on US 90/Main st., I was approaching my exit (Hillcroft St.).  There was light rain which started at this time. Lightning flashed through the sky, North East, visually right in the sky in front of me. Before approaching the lane to exist from US 90/Main St. towards the North East direction towards Hillcroft St., the lit up sky (from the lightning) revealed a bright sky, as well as a miles wide Unidentified Aerial Phenomena /UFO hovering still seemingly over the NRG Stadium/Downtown area.  It was close to the ground. For perspective for distances / sizes:  When we see a commercial plane flying above the clothes, it looks like a small centimeter from our visual perspective on the ground typically. And we can visually see that the plane is flying through and over the clouds.  This UAP/UFO was visually hovering within the clouds directly above the NRG Stadium/Downtown area, visually being miles wide in length.  I cannot assume the exact miles but it looked like it covered at least 3 miles in length.  This object was clearly and precisely shown and revealed as the lightning lit up the sky behind the object, therefore revealing the object hovering directly in front of the light in my view.  This object was grey/black in color, perfectly shaded except for the, kind of transparent, clouds hovering around it.  This object was perfectly shaped as a short top hat. The UAP/UFO looked to be several cruise ships wide.  It was in my sight for about 2 seconds.  There was a blueish/grey haze around the object, but I'm not sure what it was coming from.",

It was the largest object that ever seen the sky and I was quite stunned it wasn't sure what I was looking at. It shot off into the West sky as fast as lightning and I tried to follow it but was too fast.  And then a brite pink color filled the sky and flashed across the whole horizon.  It seemed like I could taste or even hear the color.  Was very bizarre for my young mind and I was trying to figure it all out, when my uncle suddenly jerk me up by the arm and rushed me and my brother into the house and deadbolt the door and latch the chain and was peering out the window on the door. My uncle what it was and he sternly told me,\"Shhh! Be quiet, don't say anything!!! He then told me to go sit down in the living room and don't say anything to anybody about it. I knew what I had seen was out of the ordinary and I didn't understand exactly what it was oh, but I knew that it was something not from this planet.
