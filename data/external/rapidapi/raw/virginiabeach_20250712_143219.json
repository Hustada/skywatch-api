I was stationed there as well, but, this was before we were married.  My husband would often drive home from Virginia to his home in Louisville, Kentucky during long weekends, on a long stretch of highway (I'm not sure what the name of the highway was).   He had said that one time when he was driving home, he had looked out of his rear view mirror and he said that he saw four lights hovering above the trees that were along side of the road about thirty yards from his car.  He said that the lights were two red and two green.  He stopped the car and got out.  There were no other cars on the road at the time and it was around 5:00 p.m.  My husband said that he looked at the trees and saw no lights.  He looked in the rear view mirror again and saw the lights.  He looked in the mirror on the driver's side of the car and he saw the lights.  He looked at the tree and saw no lights.  He said that it was as if the lights were cloaked.  He said that he stood there for the longest time, about 15 minutes and then he went on.  My husband said that it was the strangest thing he'd seen.

      "story": "3rd night of Orb sighting in Larkspur area of  Virginia Beach This was the third night in a row that I had witnessed an \u201corb,\u201d passing over my house, following roughly Edwin Drive at an altitude of about 1,000 ft. The first night we witnessed the same object approximately at 7:00pm while trick or treating with my wife, my neighbor\u2019s wife and our children. All three of us witnessed the object traveling in the same direction height etc. I witnessed the object again on 11/1/05 around same time and on the third evening I was outside and it appeared again. I ran to my truck and got my Nikon D70 digital camera and quickly tried to focus it on the object, while resting the camera on the hood of my truck to steady the camera. The camera had trouble auto-focusing and I switched the auto mode to sports, and was able to get three pictures, 2 of the object and the third of nothing many seconds later. I have the RAW \u2013 NEFF pictures for anyone who wants to analyze them, however you will need Nikon Capture 4 software to view the images. My neighbor wants nothing to do with this, nor does my wife. An unknown man near to us during the Halloween sighting on 10/31/05, exclaimed, \u201cIt is a UFO!,\u201d but we don\u2019t know who he was, he was not from our neighborhood. After I did a radio interview on Coast to Coast, a Suffolk man contacted me and described seeing the objects again three nights in a row. This is not the first time I have seen orbs traveling in this direction (roughly South to North) a friend and I practically chased one in the daytime in the fall of 2000. I have since learned how to set the parameters on my camera and will be ready the next time to hopefully get better pictures. I have been told that digital pictures are not as reliable as film photos, but still a pretty good amount of detail and authenticity should be able to be gleaned from these two photos by those who know what they are doing, since I have no background or experience in this type of research.

      "story": "Bright green light \"draws\" serveral strange marks over the Atlantic Ocean I was at the Virginia Beach oceanfront with five friends on a summer night in 2003. Three of them left to go play pool. My friend and I went and sat on the beach around 80th street, a few miles down from the strip. When I first saw the green light, it looked like a dotted line being slowly drawn downward slowly in the sky. It seemed to be very wide and very high, miles out over the Atlantic Ocean. I pointed it out to my friend and we both just thought it looked cool. It stopped abruptly, but about 5 minutes later it returned, a little faster now, and it was a solid line. The light made one streak and then stopped. This line remained visible for quite awhile. My friend and I became very interested after that. I called my mother and a few friends to tell them to look for it. One of those friends was on as boat just off the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and she and her friends could see it from there. We eventually settled back down, but an hour or so later the light returned. It started the same way, making a segmented line. When it came back as a solid line it made a broad, looping stroke in the sky. It was really bright green, and reminded me off a neon sign. My friend and I started to feel uneasy after the second appearance. There were other people scattered on the stretch off sand, and they all began pointing up and acting afraid. There was a group of around ten teenagers there from the Ukraine on work visas for the summer. They approached us and asked if we knew what was happening. Some of them seemed really scared. They sat and talked with us for another hour or so (it was between midnight and 1am) and then the light returned a third time. After its dotted stroke, the light made another sold line. This time the light swooped around a few times before culminating with an incredibly bright flash. At this point I became frightened as well, and I remember thinking we were seeing some kind of unfathomable missile or bomb approaching and that we were all going to be killed. Both the lines and the shape of the flash remained visible for what seemed like an hour. My other three friends came back sometime between 1 and 2 am. We told them what happened and one of them stayed on the beach with us and the Ukrainians. As I recounted the light appearances, it struck me that the three different shapes left by the solid line resembled the numbers 1, 2, and 3, in that order. This wasn\u2019t completely true, however because the \"3\" had an extra swirl at the tail before the flash. We were all completely amazed when it came back again, making the same dotted and solid line as it had the first time. I was scared, but I was also mesmerized and couldn\u2019t tear myself away. We all just sat there watching the sky, wondering if it would keep coming back. When it did (again, about an hour later), it repeated the pattern of the second dotted and solid line. I was sure it would come back and repeat the third line and its flash, and just before dawn it did. I was still completely awed and so even as my companions went to bed, I stayed on the beach. The cycle began to repeat itself a third time as the sky grew lighter. It was still visible after sunrise. I watched as the light again formed its first and second formations, but before the third pattern could be re-drawn, I succumbed to my exhaustion and went to sleep. I remember wanting to see what the newspaper or local news would have to say about the lights, but I never heard anything about it. I assumed the stations would be flooded with calls from people in Virginia Beach and as far away as North Carolina, so I never even considered calling myself. I did do an internet search to see if there were any weird tests being done at nearby military bases, but came up empty-handed. I still tell people about it, and when I run into the friend who had been out there with me we ask each other whether we\u2019ve figured out it was.  We haven\u2019t, of course.

Upon looking at Google Earth later in I saw that the path it was taking was due east.  It was really eerie, and gave me crazy chills down my spine when it flew directly over me.  It made no sound and it looked like a giant floating pinball,  but it didn\u2019t seem be reflecting anything, it was just intensely shiny.  It looked like something you would see in a movie, except only it was real and it caught me completely off guard. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by student.  PD))",

I was watching TV late at night around 2:30 am. I looked around the window and show flashing white lights. I went up to the window and noticed some aircraft flying. My first thought was a helicopter because it was moving very weirdly. It went left and up and right and up and zig zagged a few times and it moved pretty fast. I pressed my ear tot he window but i didn't hear any sounds of a helicopter instead it was just silent. I focused hard and noticed with was triangular shaped and it had a red light on each angle. there were white lights flashing but in an irregular patern. I moved away from the window and a couple of minutes later notices white lights flashing right above my house. they stopped and a couple of minutes later they flashed again. This was not the first time I've seen this. A couple of days before for a cuple of seconds i saw some red and white lights moving in a zig zag patern out the window, again at night.

Sitting next to her, I said 'See what?' And within seconds a very large triangular shaped craft appeared within my visual through the window pane in the sky. Now we are used to jets flying at night from Oceana Air Force Base in Virginia Beach, VA, but this was no jet! The craft was very close to us, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 mile and very large in comparision to jets at that range. It was probably 1000 feet in the air, flying behind the tree lines. I watched in disbelief and quickly ran out the front door to get a better view of the lights, but the craft was lower than our next door neighbors house. I could hear engines or some sort of mechanical power grrr through the sky. I ran out back but couldn't see anything else, only the sound fading away. We quickly jumped in the car to take a ride to see if we could get another glimpse of it, but we had no luck. To describe the craft: It looked exactly like a triangle starting with 5 vertical lights, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1. They were VERY bright lights, not typical commercial flight lights. A strange thing about the lights was, the 3 vertical lights had a red light in the middle. This was the only different light, and it also was very bright red. The lights did not blink, they remained solid. I would love to know what we saw, and have looked for it from time to time ever since.

We were stopped at a left turn signal on Indian River Rd.  While we were waiting for the light to change out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright circular object, at first i thought it was the full moon, but it was not the moon.  I looked at the object and I was glowing bright white to orange to redish colors, almost as if it was on fire.  There was also a tail somewhat like a comet's tail coming of of the back of it.  The way this object moved though could not have been a comet, or a rocket.  My dad was watching it as well once I pointed it out to him.  He is a high level navy Senior Cheif and now works in a control tower for a nearby base.  The object sometimes just floated, there seemed to be no sound whatsoever, and then it would make complex movements left to right, diagnoly, straight down, up, any way it wanted.  This lasted about 2 minutes. I looked at the car in front of us and noticed the couple in the car were also pointing to the object in the sky.  Soon after the object made some more maneuvers.  Then as if having the ability to accelerate to what I believe to be the speed of light, the orb, craft, object whatever it may have been.  Shot off at an amazing speed and in a matter of 1-2 seconds completely disapeared. This image has stuck in my head ever since and I dont think I will ever get an explanation for what we saw that night.  My father contacted Langley to see if any launches were scheduled for that day and there was nothing. My father works with many top officials now that he is retired and now a civilian working on base in the control tower.  He knows what we saw that night was nothing at least in military arsenal that has been released. This area has seen many sighting since then...

After about 3 min of talk I noticed what looked like a dim, pulsating, blue star moving extremely fast to the south west and ascending.  It was moving entirely to fast to be a plane and also moving to slow to be a shooting star. It proceeded to change its course to direct west and straightened its course, then went out immediatly. After about 30 sec I noticed a much brighter and continuous white light bigger than the first (about 3 times larger.) and also much lower and closer, moving at about the same speed as the first, heading in a north west direction. It proceeded to ascend also and then abruptly faded out like a shooting star about roughly a mile from my position. This was not a shooting star. After this event about 3 min to 5 min later I noticed a 3rd light that immediately shot out of the northern sky and descended to the southern sky. It then proceeded to fade out. The 3rd light I believe was a normal shooting star (Meteorite).",

Not sure of the exact date but sometime in september of 2008 many residents of Virginia Beach saw an unidentified object in the sky.  It looked like a fire in the sky that moved very slowly and suddenly disappeared.  Many people were outside viewing it and some were videotaping it, other residents from close by areas saw it too.  It was comming from the North/East over the oceanfront maybe?  It must have hung around for at least twenty minutes or so. But thats not where the story ends.  Later that night me and my Girlfriend, ((female's name deleted)) were shopping for groceries in the local Farm Fresh located on General Booth blvd.  I noticed a strange looking man walking past.  He was tall, caucasion, dressed in casual cloths and he was by himself but there was something strange about his eyes.  They looked a little out there. Heres a photo of what the eyes kind of looked like. http://daysofourlife.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/charles-manson.jpg  I walked passed and didn't really think too much of it except \"that guy looked weird\". Then I saw another man caucasion, short, casual cloths-also alone, and he had the same eyes!  I became interested and followed him for a bit.  He walked over to the magazine section and was reading some magazine(didn't look to see which one), and I told ((woman's name deleted)) about what I had seen and she told me to go up to him and ask him for directions, so I did.  His movement was very erratic and he had his head lowered at an angle(which I also found strange). I told him that I was lost and needed to know the best way to get to the oceanfront.  He spoke in a strange accent(even though his english was perfect), the way it came out sounded very monotone and far away.  He didn't turn away from his magazine and wouldn't look me in the eyes, which I also found strange.  I will tell you this, as a person who is experianced in meditation and telepathy, the man gave off a very strange, unearthly energy that I cannot describe.  I felt hypnotized by his words.  I couldn't read anything from him except th! at I felt as if I was pulled in by his strange energy.  He told me that he wasn't from here and couldn't help me.  I felt tongue tied and couldn't bring myself to say anything else.  I walked away feeling hazy, as if the experiance had happened in a dream or something.  My hand were cold and I was shaking.  I told ((woman's name deleted)) about it and she insisted that she speak with him herself as her psychic powers are natural and mine are more developed.  By the time we had returned, he had disappeared.  I just wanted to leave, so we did.  Nothing else came out of the incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I was setting up for a duck hunt in Back Bay on December 8th 2008.  I was early and began putting out decoys and it was very very dark out.   I was faceing the opan water and out of nowhere a huge bright light the size of a small air plane came around a point off a cove it was the color of fire and extreamly bright and extrmaly fast.  It was no more than 300 yards away from me and it was moveing closer to me.  I had no lights on during this time.  As it came closer I became very scared and picked up my 2,000,000 power spotlight and pointed it at it.  As soon as i turned it on the light that was like fire went out.   Five minuites later, a dark shadowy figure which was silent, came within 50 yards of me i was so scared.  It was like it it knew it was spoted and then came to see what had made that light. and seconds latter it was gone, so i thought. I emmedittly called home to tell them what I had seen i was on the phone for about 15 minutes and while I was talking I saw the it agin and it was about .5 mile away and it was on or right above the water and in seconds it was in the sky and as high as the stars,  The whole incounter from beging to end was about 35-40 min.  Oddly before this while I paddled my duck boat out to the duck blind there was a small metor shower or some like that and then a few right after the event.  The fire like light was huge, bright, very fast, quite, and amazing.   I have never seen anything like this. terrifying but amazing.

Minutes later I saw what I thought was an aircraft flashing from blue to red to green it moved quickly left and then backwards it stopped and stayed in place about 30 to 40 minutes then I saw jets flying in the area and it disappeared. The brillant flash was seen in three states. Some saw a green fire ball I did not see that, what I saw was the flashing spheres, it may have been our location. The media first thought it was a meteorite now they are saying it may have been space junk. I doubt that as Norad keeps track of that. I believe what I saw was 2 very different ufo's. I had never see anything like this before. And I have never heard of space junk or meteorites being seen across three states either, I am convinced it was a major ufo event.",

I watched it for a minute or so, then went inside to get a camera but I left my dog outside. When I came back out,the UFO was still there, so I turned on the camera, but by the time I snapped the picture it was gone. My dog was nowhere to be found. Minnie (the dog) always stays close by, so I am convinced that the craft abducted my dog. The craft appeared to have a relatively low altitude, probably 1000ft. There were no discernible features other than the \"V\" shape and bright lights. I did not hear any abnormal sounds during the entire encounter. I have contacted VA Beach PD and they think I am just a nuisance and will not process my report. I am left with no other options. Please help me.

      "story": "@ the intersection of Priness Anne Road & Upton Drive, near Red Mill Commons... A buddy and I were heading home from grabbing a bite to eat when we stopped at a traffic light and saw three lights moving in one direction. My friend asked if I noticed that the far left light was behaving oddly; it wasn\u2019t flashing, but it would seemingly disappear from view at random intervals. I thought it looked like a plane, at first, but the light positions and behavior didn\u2019t correspond with those of typical navigation lights.  Right before the light turned green, the object seemed to stop.  I was close enough to the ground to use terrestrial objects as a reference for its position.  We then began travelling towards the object on a two lane highway, leading out to the rural part of town (I gather from the way it approached that this was where it was originally, before moving towards us).  The closer we got to it, the more we realized that it had stopped moving and was hovering over a field. It was frozen in place.  The radio was at a very minimal volume and we both had our windows down.  We were more than close enough to hear a jet turbine, prop chatter, etc. At our closest point I would imagine it was roughly 125 yards out in the field. The craft was triangular in shape, but somewhat thin from a side view.  It had three lights, one on each corner of the triangle shape, and a spotlight on the front (or in the direction was moving, rather), which was casting a fading cone shape, straight ahead.  For a brief period, I also noticed a faint blue light emanating from underneath the vessel. We pulled over in a turning lane just beyond our point of perp endicularity.  As we stopped, the car behind us pulled over in the same turning lane, just ahead of us. My friend got out of the car to catch a better look, but my view was perfect from inside the car.  Shortly after stopping, the craft began floating across the road we were travelling, not quite a quarter mile behind us.  It was directly above the street; I would wager it was about 150-200 feet above the ground.  It was travelling very slow and was heading behind the shopping center we had just left. We pulled up next to the other car and asked the driver if he saw what j! ust happened. He said he just got off the phone with his girlfriend, telling her about the hovering object.  He claimed he was a seasoned pilot and began commenting on the object's triangular shape and strange hovering.  He explained how the particular craft looked and behaved unlike anything he had ever seen. Side note:  This is a tough position to be in.  I used to mock those that reported UFOs, but now, I am one of them.  My friend and I, plus the other man in the car behind us, saw something that was simply unfathomable.  This was no faded smudge from a distance or a lightning fast stream of light; this was up close and personal.",

Approximately a week later, at approximately 5pm, I arrived back  home from a Brownie Troop meeting (my mom picked me up and drove me to the house afterwards) and my mom brought my brother in the house to start dinner. For some reason, I decided to not go in the house right away, I was on the side of the house and looked up and could not believe my eyes, I saw the same UFO I saw a week earlier, I looked up and felt paralyzed and did not move for what seemed to be approx 10-30 minutes (it was hard to tell how long it was there).  The disk had square windows that beamed white light, it was silent and quite mesmerizing. When! it left it, darted up at the sky and seemed to silently disappear at an unbelivable speed.  My mom asked me why it took so long for me to come back in the house because she was almost finished making dinner.  I didn't say anything about the UFO to her because I thought she might not believe it, anyway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I watched it for a minute or so and ended up walking away for a minute to find someone else to see.  When I came back to the window, there was a second creature sitting behind the first one and appeared to have its arms around the first one from behind.  Like hugging someone from behind.  They just sat and looked at me for enough time that I figured they wern't going anywhere soon.   So, I left to find a witness, but on my return, they were gone!  I thought it was a racoon or O'possom when I saw the first creature, but soon realised it was nothing I've ever seen.  I was raised in the mountains and have never seen an animal like this!  The best description is a kuala bear.  They were no more than 1.5 - 2 feet tall, more of a brown/black longer fur, and smaller ears.  The roof top was about ~75' from my window.

The commercial aircraft was much higher in the sky.  It was at about 60 degrees above the horizon and you could see the FAA required lights along with the shape.

On Sunday afternoon I was leaving the Walmart on Phoenix Ave near the Lynnhaven Mall in Virginia Beach, VA. This is about 1/3 of a mile west of the Oceana Naval Air Station.  It was a rainy, drizzly day but had stopped at the time.I turned northbound on Lynnhaven Parkway when I saw an unknown object in the sky.  It was indistinct in shape, as it had what appeared to be antenna or spikes extending laterally fore and aft and to some degree on the bottom. It was about the size of a nickel held at arms length.  My impression was that it was about the size of a desk several hundred feet off the ground. It was dark in color and made no noise any louder than the traffic. I drove slowly and watched it travel west by southwest in a straight line at about 10-15 mph. There were no markings or lights. It started to get behind my position and traffic compelled me to drive on. It was perfectly steady and did not appear to be a balloon of any kind. I thought it may have ! been an airborne surveillance device, but it certainly wasn't anything like the stuff you see on TV. There was no obvious means of propulsion.  Just a brief, weird thing.",

Tonight the moon and Venus are farther apart than the last two nights. As I was walking my dog tonight (in a neighborhood behind First Colonial High School in Virginia Beach), I saw an orange sphere floating approximately 50-100 feet above the street/sidewalk. It looked like a home-made see-through contraption that someone put a candle or some other heat source in to make it rise like a hot air balloon. It was only about a foot in diameter.  It seemed as if one of the neighbors had launched it from their back yard.  It floated in the air and slowly, steadily and silently rose and traveled northwestward toward Venus.  As it got farther and farther away, its course gradually became more westward.  It had no tail or exhaust or contrail, just a glowing orange sphere. It became smaller and smaller like the size of a star to the human eye and then was no longer visible. The total duration of this encounter was approximately 2-3 minutes.",

Where upon we all turned our attention to the skies to examine the object.  All of the other teens quickly agreed it was a U.F.O.. I was the only skeptic at this point trying to find an explanation. What I witnessed was a black almost disk shaped craft with a series of red lights hovering in the sky.  I tried explaining it by saying it was a blimp moving slowly at a strange angle away from us so it appeared not to be moving. We debated this for about one to two minutes when the craft nearly vanished before our eyes accelerating at a great rate of speed I cannot compare to anything I've ever seen. I immediately conceded and agreed what we witness was a U.F.O.. I have never seen anything like it since, nor have I seen anything like it in any photos I've seen of U.F.O.'s online or on television.

It was silent and was below the cloud deck, but the size was extremely large.  Giant in fact.  I've never seen something so large and distinct in our sky ever.

I momentarily turned around facing the street when out of my peripheral vision something above caught my attention.  I looked up for a second and saw a rather large bright white light, hovering.  Thinking it was a helicopter at first,  I was about to look away when it occurred to me that there was no noise. At that very instant the light went souring across the sky as if it were a shooting star.  There was no gradual acceleration, it was instantaneous. I was a little freaked out. It was almost like it was watching me and when it noticed that I saw it, took off.  I've heard of people seeing weird things like this, but this is the first time it's ever happened to me.  It appeared to be egg shaped as it traveled, but could\u2019ve just been due to the speed at which it took off that made it appear to be oblong.  I don\u2019t know. But there was second, small red light attached to the large white light when it was moving. Anyway, that\u2019s what I saw. It all lasted maybe 3-4 seconds at the most. No noise. Complete silence.

It made no sound throughout the entire encounter.  It remained like this for about 15 seconds, then started to move ESE over a suburb.  It seemed to float, effortlessly for about 10 seconds.   We took the left turn and followed as close as we could on this road, and then it paused again.  We saw the reddish halo for about 3 seconds, then it concentrated into the orange light.   After about 10 seconds, the light then seemed to change directions and move South.  This time it moved much quicker, and the movement seemed more forced.   It got smaller, and it was difficult to tell how far away it was at this point.  It then faded away and seemed to disappear into the clouds.

At approximately 0845 on December 22, 2013 I noticed a white/transparent egg shaped object in the eastern sky between 20 to 30 degrees in altitude from the horizon.  The sun was rising to the south.  The sun was very bright at that time of the day and it was hard to see the object unless you blocked the sun out from your vision.  There was intermittent cloud cover starting at 0845, but became increasingly heavier up until 0945 when the cloud cover became almost full.  At approximately 0945 when the cloud cover became almost total the object disappeared.  The object never moved and it disappeared during one of the cloud cover periods.  It was hard to see because of the distance of the object and also because of the position of it in comparison to the sun's position.

      "story": "One bright traveling light splits into two in Virginia Beach sky We were driving on the highway where the sky is completely visible with no trees.  All the way towards the right, a bright light the size of an meteor and as bright as a planet suddenly appeared.  The color was white, like an LED lightbulb.  When I saw it at first I yelled, \"Look, a shooting star!\"  Quickly, I realized it was not a star.  Most of the stars were hardly visible from light pollution from the street lights.  It didn't flicker or flash like stars, planes or towers.  It seems much closer, bigger, and brighter than any of the stars.  After about 1 second, it split into two and one light went up and one went down creating a sideways Y.  This was a perfect triangle formation.  In about 1/3 of a second it completely disappeared.  When the light divided into two they were equally as bright and big as the original one was.  They disappeared in perfect sync, down to the millisecond.  I'd estimate it was about 1/2-1 mile away.  During the event, I didn't feel anything other than amazement and awe. The two witnesses were myself and my father.  Neither of us have ever been to interested in UFOs, so it was not like we would be looking for that sort of thing.

There was mild cloud cover.  Cold and clear for the most part.  I noticed what I thought at first was a shooting star.  It was a small round white light slightly larger and a little more dull than the other stars visible.  After a few seconds, the other two lights came in to view.  From North to South, over the coastline.  They flew low just above the cloud ceiling, at a pace faster than a jet in the distance, and much slower than shooting stars.  They flew in an interesting almost chaotic pattern.  They were in a kind of formation that resembled birds, randomly moving about each other occasionally.  This lasted approximately 15 seconds before they flew south and out of sight.  They did not make any noise.  I pointed them out to my friend when as soon as I saw the first light, thinking it was a shooting star.  I followed them with my finger until they were out of view, but unfortunately she did not see them.  I was pretty speechless.",

I enjoy stargazing & frequently look up while outside at night (my back door faces east) and since the moon is only 1/2 full and low on the horizon, it was dark in the yard & I just used a flashlight.  Moving southwest to northeast in a straight line I was surprised to see what appeared to be a bright red rectangular shaped object with a bright white light in the middle.  The shape was something like a sport skydiver might use, except this rectangular object was moving lengthwise.  I know it wasn't a helicopter (saw & heard the police chopper flying earlier before & after the fireworks show), it didn't look like a plane and I never heard any sounds.   I moved to the front yard to get a longer view of it and saw my neighbor (retired military, worked on helicopters) so I called him over to look at it.  He was as surprised and puzzled as I was.  He didn't hear anything and saw the same rectangular shape and colors as it was moving away from us.  The object eventually grew dim and disappeared from out sight, the entire episode lasting 1 to 1-1/2 minutes. I checked the ISS schedule, but knew I wouldn't find it listed as flying by.  I've seen the ISS before & this object was larger/lower in the sky and I could make out a shape vs. the ISS's large all white light image.",

I was focused on the airplane that was closer, it was headed East toward the ocean, (which I live about 10 miles from) when out of  nowhere a grayish flat disk shape craft came from the south and was headed right for the airplane. I thought at first I was going to witness a mid air collision, but the craft crossed right in front of the commercial airplane and after about 2 or 3 seconds of me trying to see what it was, it simply disappeared. There was no trail left by the craft, the commercial airplane kept heading East making a trial behind it. I looked at the clock and saw that it was 7:12pm, so the event took place about 7:11pm. I am hoping the pilots of this commercial airline makes a report to confirm mine. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It had white lights running across the bottom, with a couple of red lights on both ends.  Once, my brain concluded it was not behavior of any known plane that large to hover silently that low, was not a helo, was not a drone (unless it's a million dollar drone that was as big as a commercial plane and capable of holding completely still).  As I was quickly trying to call boss and yell down to another employee to see if either of them was seeing what I was seeing, running down the ramp from 2nd floor as I kept an eye on it.  I looked away for approx. 4 seconds as I looked for the other employee or anyone to tell them to look up, it was gone.  I ran back up the ramp and asked a group of men watching the football game if they had seen a blimp or anything fly over the field.  They said they were looking downward to the game. In my 54 years I have never seen anything like it and so close that I know what it wasn't.  This same location on different nights in Oct and Nov others and I have witnessed green glowing falling stars 3 feet off the ground, and tree line yellow and white ones on other occasions.  More activity in this one location then I have seen in my entire 54 years. The large aircraft continued to bother me as I had no explanation for what I AM SURE I SAW. I don't drink nor do drugs. Thus, still wanting answers, I entered some keywords into search engine and to my surprise others across the state of VA have described the same craft at about same tree line area, silent with the lights across the bottom.

      "story": "Virginia Beach UFO. At approximately, 8:41PM on December 10, 2016, I exited my car to enter my house in Virginia Beach, VA.  I was facing east and I saw something moving across the sky in a south by southwest direction, so it was moving from my left to my right at an angle from in front of me to behind me.  It stopped me in my tracks because I had never seen anything like it in the sky before. The object appeared to be the size and shape of a Tylenol extra strength tablet. It had lights on the front and back.  The lights appeared to be fluttering like in a haze.  The object appeared to be gliding across the sky at a pretty high speed, and there was no noise that I could hear. It took me a few seconds to compute what I was looking at, and I was able to rule out many explanations in my mind.  It was not an airlines jet, it was to big in the sky and no airport in that direction.  I thought maybe it was a helicopter behind the clouds, but a quick look around and I could see many stars and constellations, so I quickly ruled out cloud cover.  The absence of noise also helped me rule out a helicopter, as well as a military jet, which do fly in our area but are very noisy.  The lights were not flashing like the normal air traffic in the sky.  The lights were dull and hazy like they were fluttering. I then got my cellphone out to video.  While trying to keep my eyes on the quick moving target I also tried to zoom.  By the time I got the camera on the object, it was far off to my right and I only was able to film the back side of the object. The entire event was less than 1 minute about 10 seconds for me to process and decide to video and the 31 seconds of footage. I had just returned from dinner with my mother.  I had not been drinking and was not under the influence of any narcotics. After the event, I went into my house and called my mother, then my sister, then my son to tell them what I had seen.",

I shined my light at several of the objects and they followed my light again as if they were playing follow the leader i.e. follows my light.  The objects, which were triangle in shape, were surrounded by a field that changed shape.  The objects moved side-to-side, up and down, also hovered, and at times were completely still, NO SOUND WAS HEARD from any of the objects.   1 year ago, I saw a triangle shaped craft up and close as it appeared motionless above a neighbor\u2019s home almost appearing as if it was observing what was going on in the home at that time.  I will write that repot in detail and post it soon.  Let me just say the object I saw up and close WAS some type of triangular craft, it could for a lack of a better word camouflage itself, blending into the sky as if it was a small cluster of stars.  It was very quick and stealth. It made no sound or had no exhaust or heat signature!!   These crafts fly above t! he VA beach sky\u2019s day and night.  There are bright triangular crafts that the military use and hide in plain sight, they appear to be stars but are some type of craft that have extremely bright lights, I have seen them up close, and personal too, I believe they are some type of very Advanced MILITARY DRONE.  Not much bigger than a vw bug but quick fast stealthy, they can move around.  Just look in to the night sky for a triangular shape that appears to move just a bit.  They are there every night and day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

While sitting in the car I pointed out the clouds overhead and told him that it looked like an alien.  We both laughed and I decided to take a picture of the clouds to show his younger brother.  It was amusing.  We went inside and then carried in the rest of our groceries.   As we sat down and looked back at the photographs (one taken right after the other), we noticed that there was an white orb in the sky and that it had moved from its location in the first picture to another location in the second frame.  They were both snapped at the same time, one right after the other with my cell phone.  Neither of us saw the orb in the sky at the time, it was not the moon -- the moon doesn't move, plus we went back outside to look up at the sky to see if we could see the object.  It was gone.  It looks like there are lights inside of the orb.  Very strange.",
