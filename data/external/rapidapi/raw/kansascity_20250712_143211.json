      "story": "parabollic bell glowing hot blue white For some time now I have observed a very bright blue-white glowing object in the sky in the southwest of downtown KC. The striking thing is to a non-astronomer at first I thought this was a twinkling star.  It is not a star. It moves sometimes slow, sometimes fast and its brightness changes. I thought at first it was some sort of surveillance aircraft, it moves not linearly, but seems to be moving about the night sky.  I bought a spotting lens 30-90x.  Tonight I was able to focus on it and was amazed.  This object changed form freqauently but had a basically tranlucent body with a dark orb at the bottom or within.   At times it appeared bell shaped with a glowing hot blue white band where the base of the bell would would be  base form was fairly smoot but appeared as though it was flowing in shape and nearly constantly changing shape. At the bottom of the bell or parabola was a dark globe like form. Not to be trite but the object looked like a taco bell logo, sort of. It's activity was similar to one of those static electriciy balls, a pulsing electric form, but with straight lines and a ring rather than truly static.  The bell or parabollic form was a hazy white which seemed to rotate about itself slowly. It seemed to have stripes running from the arch to the base around it.  It rotated its nearly continually, so as to appear as though it was floating about itself. It was of intense brightness without magnification. It seemed 5-10 degrees elevated from the horizon.  It eventually took off to the west and suddently disappeared.  I viewed it a number of diffent ways.  At less magnification it looked like a parabola which was bright and squiggling. From this perspective it was multicolored including a bright blue white, with varous colors inlcuding red continually fluctuating.  As it rotated it also gave the appearance of a cylinder with the globe portion at the end. and with stripes of brighter light running the length of its body which seemed to rotate about it.  The object always appeared translucent or nearly so. although not truly a triangle, it appeared to have an elonated parabollic triange.  It behaves as though it is conducting a survey.  It is out at night regularly.  It was of such intensity that I have eye pain from watching it. I made some drawings of it.  I figured it for  some sort of reconisance craftbeing tested out of one of the numerous bases around here, and I say this because it truly gives the appearance of beig a bright star but doesn't behave like a planet in terms of its' motion.",

The lights where bigger then the house, it was so big! We stopped got out & just stared at it for like 5min.  It was so huge I couldn\u2019t be leave what we were seeing , 1 light was bigger then the house it was behind the house blocked a tiny spot of the bottom of I think the green light, but the light was still bigger then the house & it was almost on the ground that\u2019s how low it was, it looked like it was in the back yard. We couldn\u2019t really see how big it was but from where we was standing you could normally see the highway that is very lite up & trees & the huge church & parking lot , the price chopper,plus the fountain beyond the overpass but you could tell the ! craft was beyond huge because you couldn\u2019t see any of those things, it blocked all of it & that was over 5 or more blocks that are very well lite up.We didn\u2019t hear anything but maybe a light hummmm. Then it was just gone, that fast, didn\u2019t even see it leave just gone & everything was as it always is, you could see the highway overpass & everything. We never talked about it after that night until last summer 2018 I asked my son if he remembered & I got so excited when he said yes he & his brother had been talking about it, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t report it, I figured it would be on the news in the morning but it never was. I remember it as clear as if it was yesterday! I can sit down and draw a picture of what we saw & do some Research if you are interested & write me a letter and give me a form to write each down. I can go take pictures of the street house it was behind and what you can see from the way we was standing I can take a video and explain it as I remember it and give directions facings if interested in that it\u2019s not far from where I live now. Please send a letter and I can call you back or leave a message",

In 1967 I along with several others were in a sparsley poulated area around 1:00 Am and I did observe what I would describe as a World war II airplane with no lights suspended midair.I was driving my 1967 Chevrolet and there were five occupants in the car and all I remember was the airplane first to the left of my car then to right midair facing my vehicle then above my car then facing us in front of a tree and then back again in the same position and emitted a yellowish beam from the rear of the plane and we left the area as I never remember the airplane moving only remember when it was stationary.I drove to a area where there were caves that were used for storage next to a major river close to where the  river meets another major river and driving along a gravel road observed an individual facing the road in a green panel van wearing dark black sunglasses as this was in the early morning and dark as I remember telling the others look at that nut and a red light came from behind me as it was a police vehicle county Sherriff's patrol and two deputies got out and all occupants of my vehicle got out and were questioned as to why we were out in this area at this time and I told the deputies we were out looking for UFO'S and they told us to go home after checking our ID's as I thought it was funny that they did not laugh at us or disbelieve our story as we were all teenagers. A week later as I was 19 years old and living at a rooming house  as I went to take a shower on the third floor on a Saturday afternoon as I had a date and a young man with long Blond hair and wearing a white outfit and wearing dark sunglasses walked into the restroom and came straight to the shower as I opened the door and he grabbed me by my groin and turned and left. I immediatedly got dressed and went to the lobby to report this to the desk clerk and asked him if he saw a young man with Blond hair wearing dark sunglasses come down and he said no as at that time another man came down and said a young man wearing sung! lasses o pended the shower door on the second floor and turned around and left but did not touch him as he did  me. After all this occurred I was exaimed by Doctor's and an exray clearly showed that an object which Doctor's could not identify was lodged near my femur bone as this object is still near my femur bone as I have had exray's taken over the years and as of two years ago this object still near the femur. There is more to this as I married and fathered two daughters and  divorced in 1974 and who my exwife married would be of extreme importance to your organization and all UFO investigators.

      "story": "I was on my roof last night in Kansas City's Westbottem's and I was out there for the purpose to catch a UFO on camera.  It was still early since I figured it would maybe happen, a sighting I mean, at about 3 am the witching hour.  Well to my surprise I was laying there playing guitar for about an hour straight, all alone laying on my back looking up at the almost full moon.  Well the moon was sort of in the west at this point but I sat up and put my guitar down and I saw three oval shaped craft with no light's flying in formation from south to north towards the old downtown airport. The ships looked maybe brown but really stood out, against the clear night sky about 300 or so feet above me.  They flew in such a way that it looked like one craft, and there was a jitter effect on one of the oval shaped craft like tracer but they were not moving that fast maybe 100 to 200 miles an hour.   The sighting lasted about 10 to 15 seconds enough time for me to blink a couple of times. I found it strange because to start the night of I looked at the sky and said in my head LIVE  TO LOVE AND LOVE TO LIVE LIFE which is my sort of meditation words, and as soon as I was done playing guitar they flow over, it scared the shit out of me I called my dad and he instructed me to get off the roof so I did but remained at my roof hatch for the rest of the night with camera in hand but I was to late.  I am going to make it a point to be up there every night till I get footage. Good luck on your quest I am both scared a bit excited to help you with your journey, I have always believed but now my life has changed because I know.  Thank you for doing this the world needs to wake up and see what has been hidden, I was thinking about my statistic's class in collage which I went to but It was art collage, any way the chances of me catching eye of a UFO on my first night and the fact that they flow over me very low to the ground lower then a normal helicopter even it seemed, are almost impossible.  People spend there whole life looking and never see, my only conclusion is the power of the mind is a very special thing that many do not realise or they noticed that I enjoy life or, sorry, they liked my music. About me, well I am in my mid twenty's and am trying to start a Animation Studio. I have many hobbie's and have just recently started giving thanks for life not in a religious way but sort of just an outloud way and I dont kill bugs I try and save them so I see myself as maybe being good even though I still have road rage and stuff like that.",

I don't rememebr how my attention was drawn to the sky, probably by someone else.   I looked up and observed a low flying craft approx. 1000-2000 feet up.  It was large but I only vaguely remember the outline being circular or oval in shape.  What drew my attention was a circular formation of lights underneath alternating colors.   I do not recall any other lights on the object.  Our house was just 5 miles north of Richards-Gebauer Airbase so seeing aircraft was common all times of day and night. This would have been about the time that the base was slated for closing but the military traffic continued well past from when I moved from the neighborhood several years later.   The object was moving roughly from the northwest to the south east.  I rememebr someone saying \"Looks like the UFOs are landing.\"  I totally freaked and went inside the house.   That was the last I saw and I never talked about it over the years.  I had convinced my self that it was something normal, possibly a blimp.  Just recently I contacted my brother and asked him if he remembered the event and asked about the detatils just so I coudl verify that I had not missed soemthing after I went inside.  He related that he did remember, he would have been about 12-14 at the time.  He remembered the object as silvery with lights on the bottom but no other lights.   It was low and he and other(s) (Unknown who the other kids were) went in the backyard as it went over the house.   He remembers the object turning to the North and he watched it until it was out of sight.  He distinctly remembers thinking that the object definitely was not an aircraft.   pointed out the possibility of a blimp and we both agreed that that we had never seen a blimp in the area before (Especially due to the presence of the airbase) and we were very familiar with the aircraft that frequented the base since we alsways tried to identify the aircraft by the sound they made as they approached for a landing. This object made no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

The object was almost stationary.  I watched it for a total of 45 minutes and in that time it moved extremely slowly from SW to NE and descended at an angle.  The object passed behind a tree and as it was emerging from behind the tree the lights went out and I did not see it again.  On Wednesday night I was in the kitchen at approximately 20:10 and looked out my window and saw the same lights.  I got my digital camera and tried taking pictures using the RAW format.  The object moved in an almost identical flight path as the night before but this time the lights did not go out and after an hour it disappeared below the tree line on the horizon.  The light never changed in intensity or position the whole time they were visible.  They did appear to be coming toward to some degree.  There was never any sound or apparent turns.  It moved in a straight line path from high left at sighting down at about a 30-45 degree angle until it went below the horizon at lower right.  The pictures I got only show a light and not all three.  A large tree provides a reference point to show angle of travel.  The lights were seen by two other witnesses, my wife and my neighbor who is a local fireman.  I served 8 years in the US Air Force & US Army and was a police officer for 6 years.

The object was triangular in shape, with banks of very large, bright white lights across the \"front\" two sides. There were two other colored lights, I believe red and blue, which were smaller and near the points. The triangular shape was very well defined from the bottom, and in the dark in looked to be a grayish/metallic color. I continued to watch as I drove by, and the object remained in place. \tI was so alarmed and curious that I considered calling the police, but I didn\u2019t know the name of the county I was in and dropped that idea.

      "story": "UFO sighting in Kansas City - two craft exit a larger craft I was at my mother's house staying the night with her when I awakened at 3:47 AM and had a nagging feeling to go outside and look up. I did and shortly after steeping out on the back patio I saw a white round shaped object traveling from the North East to the South West almost straight overhead - maybe 15 degrees off of vertical. The night sky was clear with a few scattered wispy clouds and stars were clearly visible.  The object appeared to be a satellite, but I thought it as a little large to be a satelling and though it might be the space station. It was traveling fast but was very high up so it took a while to move accross the sky. I first noticed it when it was approximately 45 degrees up from the horizon.  I and watched it travel along a straight line until it was approximately 30 degrees from the horizon.  The thought that it could be a UFO came into my mind and I thought \"Well, if you are something not of this world then show me a maneuver so I know for sure.\"  I really wasn't expecting it to do anything as I was still sure it was a man-made craft.  At that point I was just about to turn around and go back into the house when it started wavering, then stopped dead and immediately (one second) went back the same direction it came from. I remember thinking \"satellites don't do that.\" The object traveled a short distance then stopped. Two smaller objects came out of it and moved downwards, one to the right and one to the left in an upside down V pattern.  I kept my eyes on the larger object and watched as it faded out as if moving away from the earth out into space. It was too far away to tell exactly what it was doing.  I did not find the other objects in the sky after that and don't know where they went. The time on the clock when I returned was 4:05.  I locked the patio door and pulled the drapes but was a little ancy about going to sleep after that.",

It was 4:30am and I figured I'd try to get some sleep; upon going to the bedroom I went to the bathroom first.  Something told me to look out that window.  My eyes looked directly under the tree across the street, which I might add, I live in a development.  There I saw hovering about 3-4 feet above the ground which looked to me like sparkly bright orange atoms trying to cling together, shaped in a circular formation. Well, I thought \"hmm\" must me a UFO. I hurried to my window behind my bed to see if I could see it from a different prospective.  After running around like a crazy woman, I decided to go to the front door. This was the morning before the storm and it was quite windy, but some how I missed it getting daylight.  Seems I had missing time; anyway, I looked around and didn't see it, then my eyes were drawn upward, above my neighbors house across the street only this time it was white, and it seemed to be dancing in mid air. It definately knew that I was watching it and I knew it was watching me.  It moved left to right and right to left, upward and inward, then came to a dead stop.  It was about 2-3 houses high and hovered just by the brim of the tree tops.  Then, suddenly, it started to back upward slowly real high like a dot in the sky.  At that point I thought \"Oh, is a plane coming?\" yet there was no sound.  Then I heard a plane, and it passed over in front of it.  After it passed, guess what?  The ufo came slowly back down, right in the same exact spot in front of my house!   By this time it was a few minutes after 6am or 1800, as I ran to try to find my camera, I don't own a camcorder. Franticly, and unfortunately, I couldn't locate it.  (Later that day, I found it in the spot I was looking).   My husband was sleeping on the couch and I tried to wake him up twice, for some unknown reason I couldn't wake him.  Back down the stairs I go. It was glowing from behind it a bluish and amber color and there was a red dot to the right of it.  The neighbors were leaving for work and yet didn't see this!  Then I had the idea to see if I could play with it, because that\u2019s how close it was and I felt a connection with it.  I started bending my body in different directions at the waist, and each time the ufo would move in that direction. The feeling that overwhelmed me was a feeling of love, understanding and peace and just an abundant amount of love to the point tears started rolling down my cheeks. Then I thought, \"Stop playing with my head and show me your craft.\"  I heard a hummmmm and then it stopped, and the white ufo came even down closer below the tree line and between the roofs of my neighbors two houses and poooff, out of the white came a boomerang craft \"straight forward\" and \"flipped\" on its side (as if you were making a peace sign with your fingers).  Let me tell you, I remember it happened so quickly, that I gasped!  Then I said \"Thank you, you have a very nice craft now don't hurt yourself.\" (lol). I know it sounds crazy, but it\u2019s the gods honest truth. I used 'rule of thumb, to measure' at arms width. Then after standing on its side and me eyeballing it for a good minute or so, like it was showing me its metallic etched craft it flipped back down and went backwards and into a white light again. AMAZING. It backed up, going higher and higher in the SAME spot as it did when the plane passed over, and out of sight. Since that sighting I have seen numerous crafts and strange sightings that would knock your socks off. I'm so glad I finally found a website for Missouri sightings. Additional information: I forgot to mention something that may be of importance to document. After my sighting, my eyes were burning, inside and outside. I spoke of this to my family. That night I took my glasses off and my daughter and law let out a yell, \"Oh my God, your eyes are all pink\" I looked in the mirror and low and behold ALL around my eye lids and corners of eyes looked as if they were sun burned. My girlfriend said that the red light I saw on the craft must have been some sort of laser, and that they gave me a lasor treatment; for the next week after that I was seeing \"Colors\" HUGE blots of burgandy and black while sitting on my patio, everywhere I looked. So, I went to the eye doctor, told him of the incident. He gave me every test available and said that it was unbelievable that there was no change in my right eye which I am legally blind in, usually it disintegrates at a rapid pace. To be honest it felt like I could see better.

      "story": "1952 daylight sighting of multiple discs in formation In the early Fall of 1952, I was on the playground of my grammar school in Kansas City, MO, when I happened to glance eastward at the horizon. I saw a very large number of disc-shaped UFO's glinting in the sunlight.  As I watched in astonishment, the objects passed directly over my head and continued onward until I lost sight of them, in all an event of about 90 seconds.  I had the good sense (even as a 10-year-old) to punch a nearby playmate and point upward.  He saw them too.  After school the two of us went to my house and called Richards-Gebauer AFB to report on what we had seen.  About two or three weeks later, two Air Force officers came to my school and I was called out of class and interrogated by them.   First, they asked me how many objects there were and I said about a hundred.  They were obviously shocked and, intimidated, I said maybe there were fifty.  I have always believed the number to be closer to a hundred.  I explained that the discs flew in perfect formation, in what I would today call a chevron formation.  I also explained that they did not fly in an uninterrupted, straight-ahead motion, but displayed a yo-yo motion, almost as if they were intaking air to propel themselves, then resting momentarily before the next intake and move forward, and so on.  This they did in perfect unison.  The two officers were skeptical and asked me if I knew what ducks look like in formation.  I made a V with my fingers and refused to go along with the duck hypothesis.  Then they told me that \"these things are usually reported in two's and three's, not in large formations.\"  They asked if anyone else saw the event, and I told them the name of my playmate, who was sitting in his classroom, not 100 feet from where we were sitting.  They then said they had all the information they needed and left without interviewing the other boy. Over the years, I have read much of the published UFO literature and have found only one sighting that somewhat resembled my own--that of a U.S. soldier in the South Pacific in 1942.  He also saw a large formation of disc-like objects, which at one point made a loud rumbling sound.  In my case, there was no detectible sound.  The amazing thing is that there were at least 100 children playing on that playground, and as far as I was able to determine at the time, no one else noticed this obvious intrusion into the skies above our school.  Had I not thought to signal my playmate, even I might have concluded that I saw an optical illusion.  But it was no illusion. On a couple of other occasions, years ago, I attempted to contact other UFO organizations, but no one got back to me.   Now I am 66 years old and feel strongly that I want some permanent record of what I saw to exist after I am gone.  I would also like to explore whether the record of my Air Force interrogation still exists, though I doubt it.  I have always felt very privileged to have had this unusual sighting, at the same time frustrated by the official disinformation campaign that obviously is still going on.

Passing directly in front of the moon, was a small object (to the naked eye) moving very slowly to the north-northwest.  I grabbed my binoculars out of the car, and examined the object through the binoculars.  While the object was still quite tiny even with the binoculars, I noted a bright orange/red \"sheen\", with a small white globe near the top of the object. Could not determine if the object was metal or cloth.  It continued moving very slowly to the NW, then vanished from sight.  I immediately contacted the National Weather Service office in Kansas City (Pleasant Hill, MO) and spoke with the on-duty meteorologist.  I inquired if they had recently launched a weather balloon.  He stated weather balloons for this area are launched from Topeka, Kansas which is 60 miles west of my location.  He also stated weather balloons are only launched at 0600 and 1800 hours from Topeka.  I attempted to take a photo of this object, but even with 20x optical zoom, the object did not even show up on the screen of the digital camera.",

It looked like a series of glass globes, possible six, in tandem with an afterburner/exhaust and very unusual lights on it, although it had a blinking red light on what was the rear section. It also had three bands of marquee-like lights on the bottom. There were lights between some of the sections and internally. I have never seen this type of craft before nor read any accounts of it. (You may post this if you wish...I did not have anyway to draw then post to internet so I found a program called draw where I made a \"sketch\" of the general shape.  The smaller circle at the end represents the exhaust or afterburner; the rectangles represent the three strips of \"marquee\" like lights which were solidly on...they did not blink,,,,and the small circle the red light which was flashing on and off. I am emailing you seperately the 'drawing\"  as an jpg I made using draw online software.)   I don't know if it was of earth or beyond, but it was impressive, and much larger than a typical jet.  It sounded like a typical jet but the light patterns and shape dispelled similarity to a typical jet. It made the sound of a typical jet albeit louder than average, and it appeared much larger than typical jet, if I held my arm at full length and measured using fingers I would say it appeared four inches in length, about 1/2 inch in width against the night sky.  I would estimate it was way less than 30,000 feet --maybe 10,000 feet up. <To match drawing being mailed seperately please look for KCSHAPE in tagline of my sepearte email.>",

Weather was clear, no wind to speak of. The objects flashed, with orange light (did not blink on and off) like a strobe effect. Both were larger and brighter than stars appear. Point of observation is atop a hill about 1 mile south of MO river, situated below regular MCI and downtown airport flight paths (aircraft such as commercial jets, small planes, helicopters frequently overhead). These objects were not moving: neither to either side, nor becoming larger or smaller for several moments. I called my husband to see them. The uppermost object then moved away rapidly into the northwest sky. The lower object remained stationary for another several minutes (I had time to get my telescop! e from another part of the room and aim it at the object). The object remained where it was; a regular plane flew over the space with normal movement toward airport, but the hovering object did not move at all. Finally it very slowly moved upward (judged by power line in foreground) and then away toward the northwest(in the same direction as the one before had gone) and was quickly no longer visible. Could not tell how far away or at what altitude, but compared to the commercial jet it was (estimated) about half the size of the fuselage of the jet and at about the same altitude, but seemed more distant  \u2013 no wings were apparent. When these objects moved away they quickly became \"smaller\" to the naked eye, and then disappeared. Observer is a woman with a Master's degree, and husband is an IT specialist.",

      "story": "Possible abduction, witnessed several hovering discs from the ground   The night this happened, my husband and I were up pretty late watching a movie. It ended about 1:30 AM, and I went up to bed. My husband was crashed out in the basement, so I decided to leave him there. I climbed into my bed next to my daughter (who frequently sneaks out of her bed to sleep with me). I must have been exhausted and just crashed, which is odd for me, because it usually takes several minutes to get to sleep, even when it's late. The next morning, I woke up extremely dehydrated and recalled a very startling and vivid \u201cdream\u201d of being around aliens and UFOs. This was so startling, and unlike any other dream that I\u2019ve ever had, so I decided to explore other options, such as an actual abduction. I\u2019ve heard of the UFO/alien phenomena, but had never given it much consideration till this event. I don't recall being \"beamed up\" but I clearly remember being taken somehow to a place with a lot of hallways. Then I remember feeling like I was being instructed to urinate in a long and wide tube with strange markings on the side. I think the markings indicated measurements or something. The last thing I remember was being on the ground, outside, in what looked like a vacant/abandoned parking lot. I remember the concrete had lots of cracks in it like it was old and worn. There were evergreen trees surrounding this place. There were other people standing around me with cages of small animals, like house cats, birds, dogs, etc. I got the feeling like these people around me were going to release them. I remember feeling like it was approaching morning, but it was still dark outside. I looked up in the sky and noticed several (at least four) UFO craft very near above the ground of this parking lot, just hovering. There were three red lights coming from the bottom of them that ! blurred or blinked till they became one light beam. It's very hard to explain. These craft were larger than I\u2019d have expected for what you see on television. I guess I\u2019d always pictured them being the size of a small bus, but these were the size of a large home. I don\u2019t remember ever being inside of the craft, but being inside of a building or structure near this lot. The other people there, like me, weren't completely in reality. It was like we were in a trance. I remember standing in this lot, looking up, and seeing one UFO fly high, stop, fly a little bit to the left, stop, fly higher, stop, and then flew off and vanished. So, after looking up at these UFOs from the ground, I remember it all of a sudden clicking (like a switch had been turned on) that this wasn't normal... And I remember taking off running as fast as I could. I had just snapped back to reality. As soon as I started to run, I recall the others, which I assumed had also been taken, almost clicking too and ! scattering in all directions. The last thing I recall is some ! kind of luminescent \"beam\" of sorts encasing me as I ran. I woke up very dehydrated, a bit weak, and still tired, but I remembered this almost like it had really happened. After that night, I had a minor sore throat and occasional minor pains in my abdomen. This lasted about two weeks, off and on. Ordinarily, I would have chalked this up to just being a dream or my subconscious manifesting my fears in an odd way, but the next day, my daughter said something extremely startling to me...\"Mommy, who were those boys that came and took you when you were sleeping?\" I questioned her a little, but I didn't want to push it with her, so I sort of left it be. She didn't seem particularly worried or concerned about it, just curious. (She was just shy of 4 years old at the time.) I\u2019ve since asked her about it off and on, and she doesn\u2019t appear to recall much more than she already said. Since then, I\u2019ve started to attend MUFON meetings and I joined a group for experiencers and have been speaking with the leader, who is also a regression therapist. I haven\u2019t shared this with anybody outside of this small group about this experience. I\u2019m pretty sure my peers, family, and friends would think I\u2019m crazy, so I would like to keep this somewhat anonymous. Upon reflection of this event, I started to piece together a few of my memories from childhood, and start questioning them more. For example, I remember a period of missing time when I was about 12 years old, where there were several hours unaccounted for. I had never even thought to question the \u201cmissing time\u201d or even heard that phrase till after this last event occurred. If any of this seems relevant, please feel free to contact me, but I would appreciate my name being withheld from any public report.",

I have two different sightings at different dates and times within days of each other.  On August 16th, 2011 at 17:00 in Kansas City, I was looking out my sixth floor window, facing N.E., when I noticed an unusual object. This object was higher than most planes I see.  This rectangular object appeared as a two-story building, but on its side, not tall as a building.  I remember thinking how it was not very long.  There were evenly spaced rectangular, well-lit openings which I thought at first were windows, but later I realized since they were far away, they had to be more like doors.  Although I did not count them, it seemed there were only about 8 of these openings on the first layer, then below them there were identical openings.  This \"building\" was very still, not moving for about 15-20 seconds.  Then it moved slowly and disappeared.  This object bothered me, but I decided not to report it since I did not have a picture or video. Then on August 20th, at 21:15, I looked close to where the \u201cbuilding\u201d had been, just slightly west of there and I saw 8 orbs, almost like stars, but in a loose group together.  They were a little larger than stars, all the same size.  None of them moved at this time.  After around 10 seconds three of the orbs on the outer edge of the entire group started to move slowly as the others remained motionless.  Taking turns, the first orb of the smaller group went behind a neighboring orb and disappeared.  Of the smaller group this left two and again, an orb went behind the other and disappeared, leaving one and then it disappeared.  They did not leave, they just ceased to be in my sight.  As soon the last orb was gone, the remaining larger group of about 5 orbs moved slowly at the same time but did not go very far.  Then they all repeated the same actions of the first group, going behind each other until they were gone, although they went more than one at a time as before, disappe! aring quicker than the first group.  Wondering how these orbs disappeared, perhaps they were actually going into something that was cloaked, thus disappearing from sight.  Since there were two sightings of mine, I deemed this significant so I am reporting them, though I have no pictures or video.",

At first I thought it may be something like a stealth aircraft because the Chiefs were playing at Arrowhead on this night, but then I realized most stealth aircrafts do not make noise nor do they have flashing lights.  The strange thing about this object was that it was flying just above the tree tops and it stopped and hovered for approximately 2 to 3 minutes then it did a 180 (while it was hovering) and took off at a pretty quick speed.  When I looked to the north I saw a helicopter coming at a high rate of speed toward the aircraft (we have a police helicopter station within a mile of my house),but the aircraft just seemed to vanish leaving the helicopter to just fly in circles around my neighborhood.

It seemed to be two to three times the size of a jet liner.  Two jets did fly over and under it, but evidently didn't see it.   Its white color probably blended with any clouds that were near.  The cloud that it entered was huge, but was only 1/4 as wide as the craft which seemed maybe 1,000 ft. X 300 ft.if it was a disc, it would have to have been tilted quite a bit to have shown such an exposed face which had no shadow to speak of.  Bright white and possitively Not a baloon or derigible! I was driving to eat lunch when I noticed the thing in the sky.  When I saw that it was virtually standing still or was moving very slowly, I raced to the middle school and ran inside to get some other witnesses.  Three people came out and I said \"now somebody tell me what that is!\"  Nobody could identify it, but we all agreed that it was not a conventional aircraft.  Upon entering the cloud, the others went inside the school to go back to work.  I of course had to stay, never taking my eyes off of the cloud. In four minutes, I noticed that the cloud had moved to the right with the wind ( the object had gone from right to left) and something very bright was now moving away into the distance very fast! It soon disapeared at a slight angle upward.  Art bell was correct in stating that people only see these things when they bother looking up!  I wonder what else I've been missing all these years...oh yes, as the object slid into the cloud, and the haze slid around it, It took on a grey or metalic color. the shape was oval or cylinder.

We often focus on these things, in hopes, to one day see a UFO for ourselves.  As the light moved closer towards us from the south east, the object took a shape.  To our astonishment, the object was pyramid shaped.  The light that was on the vehicle was set at the base of the pyramid.  This light did not have beam like qualities, but it seemed to be spotting.  The craft would stop, rotate the light around the body, stop the light to observe something, then continue on it's path.  We watched as the object moved closer and closer.  After about 2 minutes the object was probably 2 miles away from us at the most.  It was BIG!  There also seemed to be some kind of &quot;Heat-wave&quot; aura around it, like heat waves you see coming off of the hot streets in the summer.  There were no sounds that we could hear from the object.  At its closest point to us, estimating about 2 miles, the object turned towards the South west.  Before the craft disappeared behind the trees, it had sort of morphed into a more oval/oblong shape.  As soon as the thing had left our sight, we dashed for the car.  We traveled down I 635 in hopes to find the path of the object.  There was no trace of this object!  One thing to note: few seconds after this had left our sight, a large commercial like plane flew pretty low in the same direction as the ufo. We find this odd because there is no major airport to the sw of us.",

Next about an hour into it there were clouds moving to the east farly fast during this period i could see a few bigger triangle shaped ships and many small ones. Once the clouds move to the east fully clearing the sky and i could see these big dimond shaped ships, it looked like they were triangle shaped ships attaching to the bigger dimond shaped ones, and had small ones moving in and out of the main ship.  saw atleast 10 bigger ships moving tword one another, and then sundly the stop and all the ship started to move at the same speed at this time they were going back to the west. While this was going on the clouds stop moving to the east and started moving to the west.i could still fully see the ships moving to the west.there was a tringle ship that disengaged from the main one and then rotated counter clock wise and took off. the small ships were still what looked like going in and out of some thing. I could see the out line of a diomond ship didnt see much of it but the outline. so about an hour and a half into it there a cloud about to cover up but then stopped and some how was kinda moving in a circle. i saw these three black dots in the sky that went behind a small cloud and the the cloud fadded away. There was one of the small red and white flashing ones that was low enough that i could see the outline of it. it was a smaller circle one but it didnt go the full 360 it kinda looked like one of the ufos off of independce day. At one point when the clouds were over us  we saw this ship that looked like a glass circle going very fast through the sky. The reson why i think that they attached to one main one is that i could see perfect tringles and there all were moving at the same speed.  We saw many ships that would just take off and couldnt see nothing but a small light moving accross the whole sky. At the start of it they were not moving at the same speed they all were scattered and moving in weird ways with smaller ones zipping every where. the whole night i could not see any of the stars that are normaly here at this time and did not see the big dipper once.",

I looked at it for a time and realized that it was making jerky movements preceded by a green flash. It was a light at high altitude, crescent shaped.   I watched it for half an hour and it moved repeatedly, then I sighted two more in the southwest sky. I also witnessed what appeared to be planes with red and white flashing strobes, and I assumed that it was military observation of the phenomenon.   Then I sighted two more in the southern sky.  After 22:00 the lights from a nearby shopping center were dimmer and I was able to see more right overhead and in the eastern sky.  I became unable to count accurately due to the number of UFOs in the skies. Until last night, November 6, 2012, election night, I have been a skeptic and now I am a believer. I phoned my sister in Syracuse, NY, who is professor emeritus SUNY, during this sighting, since she attends UFO conferences and is a staunch believer.   She questioned me and was sure that I was in fact witnessing an event.   They looked different from stars which appear as a bright light that twinkles sometimes and do not move in the manner of water bugs on surface tension on a body of water like these objects did.   I am not sure of the exact duration of the event, because the election coverage was on TV and I went inside to see who was elected. I ceased watching at 22:00 and went back out at 00:30 and they were no longer there. The constellations had changed position, but that was all I saw in the skies by that time.",

NO noise heard.  No aircraft wing, tail, or landing lights. At or near the Kansas City Metropolitan Community College Maple Woods Campus, Object seemed to be gaining elevation and still heading south.  No other lights but the consistent red-orange glow was observed.   We can observe elevation due to a consistent white glow of the city that goes about from the horizon to about 30 degrees above horizon while facing due south. At or near the final location of spotting, the item seemed to be turning due east.  Then item disappeared.   Final size was about the size of a USA 10 piece \"Dime\" that is placed 12\" from a human eye with 20/20 vision.    No shape of a craft was observed. Spotted it all most directly overhead near the initial location above.   Initial thought it was a shooting star, but after watching it for 20 seconds I realized it was not.   My father was watching the documentary about the guy who got eaten by the grizzly bears and I called him out to observe it with me.  We watched the object for about a full minute or more together as it moved across the sky.   We thought it was a burning plane about the size of a Boeing 737, but realized it was gaining height and  there was NO aircraft wing or tail lights.  Looked more like we were looking directly at the exhaust of a rocket.   No exhaust cloud was observed.",

At first I thought it might just be a very bright light on a radio tower but as I got closer I could see it was not attached to anything and was 3 or 4 times higher than the towers around it.  I parked the car and watched to see if it was moving. It was moving very slowly straight across the sky and then would stop and move the other way.  It flashed on and off just like the lights on top of the towers.  I watched it for 5 minutes and then decided to get closer underneath it, so I drove to the train yard it was up above. It stopped flashing and was just a dim orangish, red color, and I could barely see it against all the street lights when I got close to it a couple minutes later.  I drove back to the spot I parked at and couldn't see it anymore.  A white light had appeared in that direction and looked like a plane coming in for a landing just to the north of Front St. and right off the highway.  I'm not too familiar with the location but I know there is not an airport.  It is very industrial and has lots of trains and big warehouses around.  I don't know if it landed or not because it disappeared behind some warehouse building.  I told my ex about it on the phone but by the time he showed up it was all over.  I know others had to have seen it because the highway is right there, and I could see it coming down 35 and 435 from Liberty.  I could see it the whole 15 minutes I was driving down the busy highway.  I have seen fireballs before that were white and red and orange but none that blinked like this one and possibly landed.

Nothing side to side or eratic just moving forward at a speed like a plane would heading in the same direction. When I came to a complete stop the light was blocked by the roof of my car along with the stars.  My upper peripheral catches movement again as the light moves from out of the blockage of the roof and I look up.  At this point my eyes are locked onto this light, no more peripheral.  You can see movement out the side of your eye and it could be anything but when I locked eyes on the object I saw it was too high to make out a shape with no blinking lights of a plane but low enough to know it wasn't a star, and it was moving.  Any sound that the object might of had was block out by music. After maybe 3 seconds of looking at the light I seen it cut real hard and fast at an angle away from earth.  The best way I can describe how it took off is Star Trek warp speed.  It went out in space and the only thing that was missing was the blink of light at the end.

It was a round green object, sorta disk-like hovering about the height of the street lights. It had red flashing lights. Many of them. There were several and they each flashed one after the other all around the disk. Then it went to only 2 red lights but still a green disk-like hovering object. It went many feet down the strip of the road and came back. It went up and down the road and stayed at the height of the street lamps.  This object would occasionally bob higher and lower but stayed relatively the same height.  I had no one to tell so I called my mother and she told me to get inside immediately and questioned why I had been watching it for a whole hour. I turned around to head inside and heard what sounded like a very short length tornado siren only a few seconds long. It stopped and as I jumped around to see what that was the object came my direction and then went back.  It only came my direction a few seconds before deciding to stay where it was already at.  I continued heading inside when it went the opposite direction it was originally going and toward my apartment complex leading office.  As it came this way it made a sound like a plane and helicopter engine combo. I booked it inside. It went behind the leasing office and disappeared but I could still hear that sound. My mom has seen a ufo so she advised me not to play around with them.  I reported another ufo back in July that I got no responses on.

We were on a hill walking down, and we looked in the sky and at first I thought something was on fire like a small plane, but then I realized it was going way to slow.   My friend thought it was just a plane at first but not that much farther away there was a plane and trust me the very bright fireball that we saw was not any kind of plane.   It started slowly getting a little bit closer then it just starts lowering all the way to the ground like it wasn\u2019t even there.   About 10 minutes later we saw a helicopter go by.  It was really creepy.",

In the sky, directly west, was a shiny white disc-shaped craft floating slowly from south to north. It had no lights of any color, and it looked as though it was vibrating at times (briefly). I slowed to watch the object, and had it in my sight for about 8 to ten seconds, then I went under an overpass, and I emerged just in time to see it flash very  brightly two times and vanish.  The object made NO sound. There were several other vehicles and pedestrians in the area, even a car in about 25ft ahead of me driving with 2 passengers, but no one else seemed to be reacting as if they saw it.

      "story": "Strange lights that fly in unison blink out when observed. Early this morning, I got up and went out on my back deck to enjoy the beautiful morning weather and night sounds.  It was still dark and the sky was clear.  I sat down for about 2 minutes, then looked up at the stars.  I don't know the constellations, but I could clearly see several points of light without any obstructions.  Directly in front of me (facing northwest),  I could see a group of three stars immediately flanked by two other lights to my right.  At first, the two lights were stationary so I didn't really think about them.  But soon they both started to slowly move from their stationary position to my left.  I thought it odd that satellites would be still and then move in apparent unison.  With my right arm fully extended, I estimate they were a hand width apart.  Very high up but still very clearly visible.  I watched them move slowly in unison, then stop in unison, then resume moving in unison in the same direction.  They followed their motion f! or approximately a five count, then the lead light simply went out, while the second light continued to move in the same direction.  When the second light reached the point where the first light went out, it too went out.  No clouds, no obstructions at all.  I'm an avid UFO person so naturally I interpreted this as a possible sighting and said out loud \"why do you always blink out when I see you?  How do you know I'm looking at you?\"  I thought this might illicit some kind of response, but they didn't reappear.  I've been fooled by birds before, but these lights were too bright and way to high to be birds.  I ruled out airplanes because they went from stationary to moving and I didn't hear any jet-related sounds like normal when a high flying jet passes over.  Helicopters don't go that high, or I'm not sure why they would, and again no noise.  Perhaps some kind of experimental craft that can go stationary, then move with no noise.  Just seems odd to me.  I've seen! these lights before and always just as I notice them, they bl! ink out. This pattern of seeing them, then they disappear suggests to me whoever they are, they know I'm watching them.  It's happened too many times to be coincidental.",

I was sitting in my bed talking online to a friend on a laptop in front of me and had the TV running to my left. I sensed something and looked up.  A sphere that appeared to be metal and about the size of a softball was flying into my bedroom from out in the hallway (in front of me to the right).  It flew about arms length in front of me.  It did not have wings or rotors that I could see, but it flew and maneuvered as a helicopter would.  I did not hear any noise from it.  I didn\u2019t see any windows, etc., but it must have had some type of sensors.  It turned by pivoting in its space and started to fly away toward the wall in front of me.  I thought it might have been some sort of police spybot, but I had no idea how it would have entered my house or why. I wasn\u2019t dreaming.  I was wide awake with lights and noise from the TV and typing on the laptop and the light happened to be on in the hallway.  It was a completely physical experience, until it flew right through the wall of my bedroom.

In the upper left hand corner, you can see 3 faint lights in the shape of a triangle that I am 100% positive were not stars or a plane or anything like that because we didn't even see the lights with our naked eyes.  There is proof its not just a filter or smudge or anything because you can see a plane in the upper right corner of the picture.   I decided to put the picture through a few other filters on an application on my desktop and could make out a kind of rim that was connecting the lights.

      "story": "Thin cigar horizontal red pulsating light flying south over downtown Kansas City MO. I was a passenger in a car traveling westbound on I-670/70 out of downtown Kansas City, MO during the evening of December 14 at approximately 10:45 PM Central Time.  My point of view was on the Kansas side looking East towards the downtown KCMO skyline. At this time I saw a horizontal cigar-shaped, thin red light at the same approximate height of the skyline.  It appeared to be either behind or almost directly over downtown.  The width of the light was approximately the same width of many of the skyscrapers. The light would pulse uniformly on and off similar to an aircraft, but there were no other colors or pinpoints of individual lights, just one solid horizontal red light. I-670 curves to the south just outside of downtown, so during this portion of the travel I could see the craft moving south with us.  It then cleared the skyline and was flying over the shorter buildings due south of downtown, confirming it was not a strip of lights at the top of one of the skyscrapers. I lost sight of it once the road curved due West and downtown was no longer in view.  I was so mesmerized by what I was looking at that it didn\u2019t occur to try and snap a photo.",

I've lived at my location for 20 years, and have never seen a satellite because of the light pollution.  I watched it enter toward Orion's Belt for about a minute, then it stopped.  I observed it in a stopped posItion for around 3 minutes.  It was slightly brighter than any star, but was too high to be a conventional aircraft.  It looked like a star.  I went indoors to get a video camera, and when I went back outside 1 minute later, it was gone.  Nothing else in the sky in the direction it was travelling was moving.",

It was not a continuous light but retracted through the ceiling by my door.   I grabbed my flashlight which I kept by my bed to shine it on my dog to see what she was barking at, but before I can shine the light, I can already see her green eyes which meant there was a light source, so I look up in right above the tree in the backyard was a disc ovary with lights blinking counter-clockwise about 50 ft in diameter I looked at this thing and mentally something was telling me come with us, mentally I could feel myself saying no.  After what seemed like five minutes, it turned into a bright ball of white light and zoomed straight up, and within a matter of one minute, it looks like another star.   I went and woke my sister up and told her what happened.  I grabbed my BB gun and gave her my baseball bat, and we went to go check on my dog who was okay.  I did not wake my mother up because she was a school teacher.  The side of my face just kind of hurting, so I went and looked in the mirror and there was a mark on my face like I have laid on something, and look at my pillow but there was nothing there to this day that mark is still on my face.

I went and grabbed my dad but by the time he came outside you couldn't make out anything besides red lights in the distance.  As I was explaining what I had saw, a second aircraft that appeared to be the same exact design, same relative altitude, followed the first craft but at a much higher rate of speed, higher than any aircraft id ever seen flying that low, I spent hours outside after that watching but no other unusual occurences.  Both aircraft made relatively no sound for the speed and size of the aircraft.  Will provide sketch and map of where I was and exact direction of crafts if requested by an investigator",

All of the sudden I noticed a brighter than the rest light that appeared as a dot like a star but larger and brighter and completely stationary/not moving. As soon as I looked at it literally 1 second after I locked eyes onto whatever it was it streaked across the sky out of sight off into the horizon at what seemed like the speed of a shooting star. I was shook at what I had just witnessed all in 2 seconds. I kept telling myself it has to of been a shooting star but then how would it be possible for it to be stationary as it was when I had first made eye contact with it. I cannot explain what I had witnessed with a sober mind and absolutely history of seeing things that aren\u2019t there. What I have j! ust seen defies any reasonable explanation. Whatever I witnessed could be clearly differentiated from anything known.",
