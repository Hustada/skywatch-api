Two star looking dots, lined up along a North/South axis, seemed to move slowly towards the south. They were actually so slow that at first, I thought they were stars and I was just experiencing a perspective illusion. However, the gap between these two objects and the closest constellation was constantly increasing. I thought of satellites maybe. They were not travelling as fast as satellites. Then, what are the odds of two satellites travelling on the same elipse, at apparently the same speed? There was neither any jet sound, even high altitude ones, nor any port, starboard or tail lights. I rusehd inside to get binoculars, which literally took me 20 seconds, but by the time I returned, I could not locate the objects anymore. Had they been static, I could never have told them from regular stars.",

At approximately 11:30 AM. while at work, I looked up into the northern sector of the sky at about the 1:00 or 2:00 position.  Difficult to see was a small sphere like object, white in appearance and resembling a star but rounder edges. Two co-workers also saw the object.  It did not move for a period of at least 30 mins. It was very bright, sunny day, with wispy high clouds that moved fairly rapidly as it was quite windy.  My first thought that is was possibly a weather balloon.  It was difficult to spot, and the fourth person was not able to see it because of the bright sky, though the sun was behind and above us.  I took photos with my cell phone, but strangely there is the pole I used as a marker but instead of the very small object we were looking at there is an oval large bright light.  This happened in two consecutive photos. I was wondering if anyone else has reported anything like this today.  There was a tremendous amount of jet traffic and contrails in that sector of the sky. As far as I have checked there were no unusual celestial events going on either.  I thought I would go ahead and report this since we have had some ufo sightings in this area recently. ((NUFORC Note:  We just spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite credible.  She had contacted the National Weather Service, and Carlswell AFB, attempting to determine whether they might have launched weather balloons, and they both reported that they had not done so.  We do not know what the witnesses observed.   Also, the witness reported that there was quite a strong wind at ground level, and that the object appeared to the several witnesses to remain motionless for in excess of 30 minutes.  PD))",

The weather was very clear and breezy with some clouds.  The sun was beginning to go down in the west. I saw an object way off in the distance approaching from the north west.  It was quite high in the sky and moving slower than a jet plane moves. There were no clouds obscuring my view of the object.   I watched to see if I could see any lights but there were no bright lights or blinking lights. I could see no wings.  It was difficult to determine the shape but looked slightly triangular at one point.  I thought I could determine some shifting of the shape but I couldn't really tell.  It curved around to the west towards the setting sun.  It never varied in altitude, neither going up or down and the speed always remained the same.  I wondered if possibly it was a weather balloon but I have seen those before and usually the balloons relect white and this was dark brown.   I wondered about a large bird but it looked too big a bird and it wasn't a flock of birds but a solid object.  I watched this object for about ten to twelve minutes and then had to go inside because of the cold air.  It was still in sight when I went in.   Unfortunately I did not have my camera and was the only person outside at the time.   From my vantage point it was high enough in the sky to be way above the two story buildings and trees.  The size from where I was was about one eighth of an inch to a quarter of an inch.   We have alot of air traffic in the area because of DFW airport, Lockheed, and  what used to be Carswell AFB.  It looked as if it was high over the base at one point.   I am familiar with all types of aircrafts and balloons and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen.

At first, I thought it was a large bird, but there was no wing movement.  No sound, no jet trail, no lights, very black.  It stayed on a steady course from the southwest to the northwest. moving very slowly.  I saw a similar object last July 3, 2008, but the sky was slightly darker, and the object was lower.  It moved very slowly, as I was able to watch it for at least ten minutes, both times. This year, there were clouds, and they appeared high and thin.  The object was black and showed up against the sky and clouds as did the object last year.  I did file a report with the National UFO Reporting Center last year as well.  The object last year, appeared to have some indentation at the top and was very black.  This time it looked more round, but the movement was exactly the same.  There is an air base (joint command) off a! bout three miles from where I live in Fort Worth, TX. in the direction the object was moving.  Last year, when I described what I had seen with a coworker he had seen the same object. He lives close to where I live.  He described the object exactly as I did, moving from the southwest to the northwest.  Interestingly, he said one of his neighbors had their cell phone and it began to make noises and light up as the object passed.  I think possibly it might be a government experiment, but it was very strange.  No triangular shape.  Just a rounder shape.  I did take a photo of the object with my cell phone, but I am not sure I captured it as it was high.  I would be glad to foreward the photo to be analyzed.

More like how chemtrails are, a trail that swells up and gets fatter as it spreads out.I could see two of them, and yes, definatly what a dogfight would look like!  What I (we) saw earlier looked like a very large triangular shaped craft with several white lights around it and one red light. But they were blinking or rotating. The other ones were very small in comparison to those.Because it looked like they were flying right at them and then they would turn away sharply then the big craft would sort of chase it and then shoot out the opposite direction really fast.At one time we counted 6 of the large ones.  I am so glad my step-dad was there to see it too, I would of thought I was seeing things and not ever told anyone else. But I know what we saw!  (friend's name)  *************************************************************  (friend's name):  Okay, so are you telling me that it looked like a dogfight between a very large triangular U.F.O. and a bunch of smaller disc-shaped U.F.O.s?  If so, this mirrors what a few people have seen using expensive, military-style, night-vision scopes. They actually had a show on Coast-to-Coast about this several months ago, but I've never heard of anyone being able to see something like this without night-vision equipment. I know this sounds like something out of Star Trek, but the U.F.O.s must have had their cloaking systems down?  Remember how I told you recently that there are good E.T.s and others? Well, some who are supposed to be in-the-know say they have been fighting around the Earth lately because, believe it or not, and again this sounds like something out of a Sci-Fi movie, our planet supposedly is the site of the last struggle between the Light and the dark.  You, (friend's name), may have witnessed the opening salvos of the open Battle for Planet Earth.  Is this real or what?  Wow! You have witnessed history, Jeanne, and I have been able to tell the world about it. This really is something else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What else can I say? Thanks for this update, keep watching the sky, and please try to keep track of all details regarding colors, shapes, time of events, etc. Do you have a camcorder? If so, use it!  Let me know more asap.  Thanks, and may God and the Angels be with you.  I will forward your update to everyone.  Again, please keep me posted.  (my nickname)  Important Note:  I sent a follow-up email to my friend in Ft. Worth with NUFORC's phone number, a link to your online-report form, and asked my friend, if she was able and willing, to contact NUFORC directly since she was the one who actually witnessed these potentially-historic events.

I was sitting outside in the dark looking at the sky and noticed what I at first thought was a star. Then it began moving around and changing directions real fast. It was triangular shaped with white lights all around it and one red light. The lights were blinking or rotating. There appeared to be other smaller crafts darting toward it and then they would turn sharply and go in the opposite direction. And the large triangular craft would sort of chase after them. Either the smaller crafts were shooting at the larger one or vise a versa. But you could see smoke trails  all around it from what looked like missiles. I went in the house and told my step-dad and he came outside too with his binoculars. We counted at least six of the larger crafts all around the sky. We could see what looked like laser lights shooting all around it, then it looked almost like fireworks. Then I saw something out of the corner of my eye and had to take a double look. Above the trees and the house next door was a ball of fire falling slowly to the ground but it almost looked like a big balloon drifting down real slow. I yelled at my step-dad to look, we stood there watching it trying to figure out what it was. It was real close and it looked like it was landing in the back yard across the street. I tried to follow it but lost it. I know it must be in the close area.",

Fireworks had begun in the distance; however over an unpopulated area, a bright glow was evident.  Note that it was just beginning to be dark and landmarks were visible. The object was North West of my position; about 70 degrees above the horizon.  The color was bright red along the color of a road flare.  The size I estimate was close to the size of a van or small moving truck.  The object was round in shape and a constant glow that was very visible.  I do not believe it to be a firework product since no others were seen anywhere or anytime during the 4th. The object was stationary for 30 to 45 seconds and went out instantly.  No smoke was observed in the area of the sighting.  I was shocked to read about this in several publications and decided to file this report.  I cannot identify the origin of the object but I will confess it struck me oddly at the time; and to this day.   Please note I am very sincere about this happening since it occurred near a Navy Air Base.",

I was sitting on the back porch, as I do every night, and watching the stars appear.  I noticed very bright lights in the East Southeast sky that were unusually bright.  They had the appearance and bright light of a planet but I knew this could not be the case. I am not sure what planet is in the Eastern sky over Texas this time of year, but these two objects were due South of this planet and appeared just as bright.  Almost to the point where you would think there three planets in a small cluster. There were several planes in the sky at the time, so it was easy to distinguish the two objects that I was observing and determine that they were not planes.  Plus, the objects were at a such a far distance that you would not be able to spot a plane that far away. As soon as I got up out of my chair to observe further, the object closest to the South vanished very quickly.  It did not appear to move away quickly, but rather it just faded out very fast. The other object was still shining brightly, just as bright as the planet to the North, and then, it too vanished almost immediately. Although I live very near to an Air Force and observe the flight patterns all of the time, this by no means resembled any of the planes that fly by and these objects were so very, very far in the distance that I do not think a plane could fly that high.",

My double bedroom window faced the East.  I always had to go to bed at 8 PM.  As I was climbing the stairs I began to hear a faint humming sound.  As I arrived at the top of the stairs and turned left to my open bedroom door, I walked across my room to my opened windows, as the humming became easier to hear.  As I looked out my window, hovering over my neighbor\u2019s house were three small flying saucers hovering.  They were around 5 feet in diameter in a formation of a triangle, one in front and the other two behind the first.  They were roughly 5 feet below my window seal and no more then 20 feet away.  Back in the 50\u2019s we didn\u2019t have shows that were about UFO\u2019s much less thought about them at my age.  I froze in disbelieve.  For at least a minute I watch and listened.  All three were identical.  First being saucer shape with a 2-foot diameter dome no more th! en a foot high, the outer skin was like frosted glass, barley transparent.  Around the edge was a 6 inch blue ring, shaped like dominos side by side.  In the middle of the dome was a pendulum that went counter clock wise around and around. It was easy to see passing under the frosted glass shell and the blue rings.  All the time making the humming noise as it revolved.  I had to prove to myself that this was real. I turned around with my back to them, but still heard the humming sounds they were making.  I turned back facing them and watch in amusement for at least another minute.  I again turned my back to them. As soon as I did, a few seconds past and the humming sound stopped.  I turn back towards my window and they were gone. I don\u2019t expect anyone to believe me.  My parents just laughed just as anyone else would have who has never witness such an unbelievable sight.  I even don\u2019t expect whoever reads this to believe my story.  I never told a soul till a few years back to my wife of 22 years.  As I told her, I am probably just a few people on earth who ever saw a UFO up close, much less three.  Most sightings I read about are lights in the sky, not something as clear as looking at your TV set across the room. I would not mind being tested under hypnosis or any other test to make believers of what I witness when I was eight years old, but I doubt if even that would ever happen. Because of my sighting I have no doubt what so ever that there are others in our universe.  As I became older I figured the small spacecrafts were more of a surveillance craft sending images to the Mother ship.  Not occupied by small aliens.

      "story": "Red LED lite @ incredible speed, approached saw circular sheer curtain of opalecent color 6 rays glowed around circle Saturday September 17, 2011 4:31am: I went outside, was on 2nd floor balcony, which faces due south, smoking a cigarette before I went to sleep, wasn't looking into sky, and was looking straight ahead into next apartment building breezeway. A small non-flashing, red light (like a LED light or power indicator light) came into my field of vision; I wasn\u2019t looking up at the sky or anything.  It immediately captured my interest because I thought it was flying extremely low.  I then considered a logical explanation; I thought it must be a helicopter?  However we don\u2019t see many helicopters in this neighborhood unless it\u2019s the law chasing somebody & if that were the case, there would have been searchlights.  We are not close to the hospital district, downtown police helicopter landing strip, or airbases. I considered that maybe it was an airplane of some sort?  If it was, wouldn\u2019t it be flashing?  In addition, don\u2019t they have flashing white lights as well?   As it approached, I heard absolutely no sound whatsoever. The sky was clear; however it had rained for the 1st time in over four months most of the day before.  The air was humid & thick.  What I saw was moving at an extreme high rate of speed, faster than anything I've seen.  I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off it and I blinked a couple times, just in case my eyes were playing tricks on me. It remained at the same elevation, heading from my right to left diagonal path.  As it grew closer, I noticed some sort of circular type field around the red light in center.  This circle was not a sphere; it was more like a sheer curtain, flat, possibly a force field?  The circle was translucent & it was glistening/shimmering opalecant colors (pink, blue, green crystal).  It was not twinkling like Christmas lights, no blink pattern at all, it was more iridescent like abalone shell, but again it was about 40% transparency.  There was also some sort of crystal beams or rays; I think 6, surrounding the opal circle.  They were shining from the circular field, all the same length, just about the length of the circle in size. I simply couldn't take my eyes off it. I then realized I had my Android mobile in my hand, so I hit the buttons to quickly try to capture it on digital.  It took me less than 5 seconds to get it started, by then; the object was straight above me. I tried to get it in my viewfinder, but it was moving so quickly, I just couldn't keep up.  I attempted 3 shots, about 8 seconds apart, unfortunately, I've no flash & the lens was on the full zoom out level. It then was out of my view as it flew over the building.  I ran down the stairs trying to adjust the zoom in, I got to ground level and out of the breezeway.  However, my view was then blocked by the building. In retrospect, I should have run to the street, but I didn't think of it, I was so amazed!  The event lasted about two minute\u2019s total.  I felt no fear of the object; I know they didn\u2019t notice me.  I gave up & went upstairs & into the apartment.  I looked to see what I might have gotten on digital, but with no luck, just darkness.  I went to sleep.  I woke up at 10am & the first thing that went through my mind was the event.  I plan to upload the photos onto my computer & see if I can find anything by resizing them.  I have started a drawing of the object in Adobe Photoshop.  To my knowledge, no one else witnessed the event. I will send a drawing of what I saw in a future report.  Lat: 32.65, Long: -97.40 (this is the info from the camera)",

Disappeared after 20 minutes My roommate and I were having a cigarette on the back porch last night (technically this morning).  There's a wooded area just east of our house.  Over the course of about 20 minutes, a group of whitish lights began to flash Over the woods.  I would estimate that they were about  a mile away, maybe half a mile off the ground.  The lights seemed to hover in place in a vaguely pyramid shape.   My roommate tried to get a video of it on his phone, but his camera is pretty useless and wouldn't help my case at all.   After 20 minutes had passed, the lights slowly began to fade.",

It was a warm evening with good visablity. While I was playing my flute, all of a sudden I saw in the corner of my eye a bright white light coming in to my view from the southeast part of the sky. I stopped playing and watched as this bright white globe streamed across the sky from  (southeast to north), desending from right to left at about a 40 degree angle towards the ground. It was very close, not far away. I did'nt know what it could be. I really didn't have time to think about it, it happened really fast. It looked like it was just above the greenbelt behind my house. It appeared like the full moon, yet it was at least twice as large as a full moon. Also, the moon was behind me and was only partially lit, maybe a 3rd of the moon was lit. So it definitly wasn't the moon.  It almost seemed like it was just east of the house next to me, maybe a little further, maybe a 100 yards, where there is a green belt that separates our houses from the apartments that are on the top of the hill. As it streamed across the sky, after about 4 or 5 seconds it produced two little white flare like jets of fire, one on the top, and one on the bottom of the globe. The outside part  of the globe then started spinning in a clockwise motion while it was descending, the inside of the globe was stationary. This lasted about 3 or 4 seconds. Then, it fell towards the ground. When it was about to hit the ground I, stood up and screamed &quot; Oh My God &quot;, as I expected to hear a large explosion. But it went behind the trees and dissappeared with no sound. The whole time of the sighting, there was no sound coming from it. I looked at my watch and it read 10:35 PM CST. I want to repeat that this globe was large and moving slowly at a 40 degree angle downwards. It wasn't the moon, it wasn't an airplane or helicopter. I've never seen a ufo before,and I never expected I would ever see something like this. It's ! the most incredible thing I've ever seen in my life. In regard! s to my feelings, I started thinking about the events that are happening around the world. In Japan, New Zealand, and the volcanoe in Indoensia erupting. I started becoming concerned that this was a sign or a warning. I was worried that more was about to happen, but it didn't.  At least not last night.  These were just my feelings.  The experience was very intense and I still have so many questions.  That's really all I can convey at this time.",

I just read a ton about ball lightning, but I doubt ball lightning inspects people or their houses when people are sleeping. It sounds more like a monitoring tool of some sort.  I remembered watching UFO reports about balls of red light floating over houses and fields.  And I wonder if this is one of them.  Anyone else experience something like this?

It seemed to appear out of nowhere. The sky was clear. At first we thought it was some kind of flaring firework because people had been setting off fireworks in the area as the New Year began 45 minutes prior.  We were baffled that this \u201cfirework\u201d was suspended motionless in the air as we were driving past it.  It was more baffling that, upon further observation, the light appeared to be an illuminated, orange ball hovering in the sky.  It did not appear perfectly round like a sphere; but, rather, it looked more ecliptic or egg shaped.  The object was to the right, or east, of us by a perceived 200 or 300 meters away.  After looking at it for about 15 or 20 seconds as we were driving by, the object suddenly started moving!  It travelled northward.  Neither my daughter nor I heard any noise emanating from it. With my curiosity peaked, I proceeded to \u201cchase\u201d the object and turned eastbound as it continued northbound, east of us.  The object appeared to start accelerating and gaining altitude as I drove under its path of flight.  At this point, I got my phone camera rolling. I turned northbound at the next street.  However, the object was now going too fast to catch up while driving down residential roads.  I stopped my car and continued filming for a few more seconds until it was too far and faint for the camera to pick up anymore.  However, I could still see it with my eyes as it changed its heading from north to northeast.  I could tell that it changed course by using a street light as a reference point. As the object was moving, its illumination had a slow, subtle pulse to it in about 2 or 3 second intervals, from bright to dim then bright again, repeatedly.  The pulsing was very subtle and not immediately obvious. This was NO Chinese lantern!  It had started moving from its initial stationary position much too quickly. It was not windy; 5 mph at the most.  This also had too much range and speed to be a remote controlled helicopter.  If it was a drone or UAV, why would it be illuminated orange as a whole?  And why so low?  I am very curious as to what this object could have been.",

      "story": "I know the Feds know more than what they're claiming too, I've swatched from the shadows too many years. \tI was a warehouse worker, on the job, at 620 pm, at one of the factories on the Southside of Fort Worth, Texas, during the evening--shortly before sunset. \t\tI was moving stock up a ramp, in back of the main 2 story office/factory building, when I noticed a sun glint, in the sky, over a neighborhood across the street from the plant. \t\tThe gilt was around 20-30 stories high as I measure the downtown towers, I use to work around high-rise buildings for a number of years. \t\tBecause of their size, I at first mistook them for a C-130 cargo plane, climbing, as UPS and other carriers often fly over from the airport, so I was just about to look away, when I noticed an odd pale glow. I took out my pocket binoculars to look closer and saw two metallic spheres. They had deep groves along the equator, with plated skin like an air craft. They were close together as if they were magnetized \u2013 with a white vertical beam of light or gas jet that seemed to balance them \u2013 as they made see-saw and wobbling motion from the high wind gust\u2014they seemed weightless. They reminded me of a bubble head doll as they moved north by south wobbling, and this odd white beam remained fixed between them like a balancing rod. They seemed in a hurry and one seemed disabled, with the other, facing south as the tolling craft. I could tell that they were flying directly over the houses across the way on Mcart Street. I soon got concerned about that white beam pointed toward the ground, as I watched the objects move through a cloud, I lost sight of them, and became fearful they might turn my direction. That beam was at least 200 feet downward with 5 feet width or more, as far as I could guess, but I couldn\u2019t tell what kind of energy it was made of \u2013 gas or light. I quickly went inside the building. When I got the nerve to come back out, on the street side, I noticed a man walking on that sidewalk unharmed. So I quickly moved to the sidewalk on Mcart \u2013 but when I got out where I could see the sky better, the objects were gone. An airbus came from the south direction at the same altitude \u2013 so I got to compare its size, using my finger and I determined the two spheres were half as long as the airbus. That meant each had enough room for at least 50 human size passengers. The fact, I didn\u2019t see the spheres anymore \u2013 didn\u2019t surprise me, as that wasn\u2019t the first sighting of such objects, in that area and elsewhere about the city. Here\u2019s a spot for more of my background. My interest in UFO has been a on and off affair \u2013since my mother recounted a close encounter at a very young age. She the youngest girl and a uncle the youngest boy of 13, on a farm around 1934 or 5, where they came within ten feet of a glowing sphere. \u201cIt was a huge white ball with black lines running from pole to pole and it hummed like a high voltage transformer.\u201d  I asked her how close it was.   She pointed to a wall about ten feet away.   She said, \u201cWe had snuck out that night and was about to cross an open field, when this huge ball suddenly lit up in front of us!  We just watched it for a few minutes, then, the older ones grabbed {her & my uncle} and took off down the road\u2026we never saw it again.\u201d That story was verified by her siblings as much as 40 years apart \u2013 each time they initiated it. It wasn\u2019t until July 1973 when I had my first sighting. I had just arrived in Texas and was living in Dallas at that time.  I was outside reading a book, on the back lawn, when I notice a squadron of F-16 fly over.  They were moving rapidly west to east -- in formation with 5 or 6 glowing spheres that phased in and out of sight. That incident made me more aware of my surrounding, but it wasn\u2019t until a night in July 1997 that I saw a test flight of a craft that was man made; it took off along I-35w near an air strip I know of in Keller, TX. It was long and big about the size of a 727 and that was about 9 pm as I was moving north on I-35.  I saw it lift off from below the trees \u2013 it had a faint pale greenish blue glow.\t \tIt was invisible to anyone beneath a street light or anyone in downtown area. \tI just happen to be in the right spot at the right time, when it climbed to a height directly over the Bass tower in Fort Worth, and it stopped on a dime.  It remained at station keeping for several seconds; it began moving in wide circular patterns, so fast, it seemed to be two places at once. \tThat went on for almost 30 minutes, then, it returned to its landing strip.  Being a member of a large family, I had relatives in various fields \u2013 like the corps of engineers. Sometimes they went to work at the D.U.M.B. where CIA security have to supervise their handling of blueprints stored in a metal scroll like device, so only their area of work is visible. We figured down there is where the craft proto-types are stored and developed. \tSince I worked at this factory location, I\u2019ve been able to spot a number of alien objects and observed the government\u2019s reaction. It was a clear night, on a Friday, in Feb. 2008; I had just arrived for work at 11pm, when I saw a bright object drop in the southeast. I thought it was a meteorite and looked away, I continued walking north along the loading rim of the loading dock. I went up a short flight of stairs, got my clipboard and continued north, passing 3 overhead docks door. I was about to cross the space of 45ft, between buildings, when I glanced to my left, towards a long 1 story building that ran north by south and next to it was the 2 story front office building. I looked and saw that same bright yellow object still in the sky. \u201cThat\u2019s no meteorite!\u201d  I said out loud, as I watched the object make a controlled landing not more then a few blocks away from where I stood.   It looked that close.  And it was at least 30ft wide shaped like an egg \u2013 but extremely bright like the sun,  I use to work at an airport and seen hundreds of chopper landings in all weather conditions and that thing made a perfect soft vertical landing. I just took off for the front as fast as I could navigate the complex and when I got to Mcart Street \u2013 I saw no trace of it. That object was as bright as the sun.  I expected to see a fire on somebody\u2019s roof \u2013 it came down right below the roof level of our complex \u2013 and it appeared very close. I was expecting a chopper to arrive, one did, a gray one, but it was circling the wrong area.  It did so all night, leaving once to refuel and came back. Days later, I saw one odd looking black chopper fly about the area, in a search pattern, but it didn\u2019t stay long. About 2 week after that, the chemtrails started and so did larger objects appear. I\u2019ve lived and worked in this area 10 years and never seen a chemtrail.   But now, it sprayed as thick as a blanket, until the sky has an eerie look and smell. \tOne weekend I noticed a small blimp with an Insurance company logo, fly over this cluster of houses located in an isolated spot where gravel is dump and hauled. \t\tI was driving stock toward the warehouse headed west as I saw it, the blimp turned toward me.  It came directly overhead, I suddenly got sick.  My pulse started racing and I felt flushed and it lasted until the blimp moved away from me. \t\tI moved clear of the area and watched with my binoculars as the blimp just kept circling this one cluster of houses for several hours until just before sundown and then it went away headed north. \tI saw it return weeks later, from the north and circle this same group of houses, seemly all afternoon, then, it would leave the way it came.  Inside the blimp I saw one, or two people in the cabin at the flight controls \u2013 but no passengers. Shortly after that, maybe a week or more, I saw an airbus moving eastward with a huge thick trail of dark smoke behind it.  I almost thought it was in trouble, because I saw what I took for smoke move away from the cabin, but it wasn\u2019t smoke. \t\tI was wearing a pair of very dark sun glasses that enabled me to see the object clearly, as it was almost invisible to the naked eye. This object that cut across the path of this airbus was huge \u2013 it dwarfed the plane by thousands of feet. It moved toward the ground in a U shape \u2013 when it reached the ground it dissipated. \tI looked toward the south of the plane where the sky hadn\u2019t been spray-- and saw this mass of objects move from the upper atmosphere and cross paths with the plane, once again moving toward the ground. I thought they were meteorites. I could see grainy chunks moving in mass toward the ground, with a faint pale yellow green color and dissipate as they reached about 100 feet. After a moment of trying to figure out what I was seeing, I then thought it was a sun flare that had punched through the atmosphere.  But it wasn\u2019t that. I saw another object come down and cross paths with the airbus, and as I advanced closer, I could see chunks of inner mass move in long stringy formations, like a jellyfish tentacles.  \tAt that point I began to wonder, if I wasn\u2019t seeing something that was alive. Then I realized, all during this incident, the plane hadn\u2019t moved much since I first saw it.  It was still in the same place in the sky. \tThat plane was spraying a huge mass of chemicals and I was ready to stay clear of it, so I fled indoors.  \tThe black opts projects in Texas are in full gear! Since May, 30, 2008.  I\u2019ve stood below test shots of energy beams, 20  to 30 feet wide, shot from a University rooftop at clouds 60 ft above my neighborhood,  I seen metal framed jet powered drones fly overhead. \tI\u2019ve even seen our folk, or them, make a huge Jacob\u2019s ladder or escalator in the clouds for about 55 minutes. \tYou could see the moment they turned the switch off, the wind and clouds settled down, as if nothing had happened.",

      "story": "\u201cStar\u201d after sundown before stars out; instantly became brighter; white cloud like explosion; an object shot out My wife and I witnessed an event that appeared to be an explosion of a very high aircraft or even a spacecraft.  I reported to 911 as we were observing it.  The 911 operator called back about 40 minutes later advising that she reported our sighting to the FAA and suggested I submit a report to you. At 8:05 PM, about 30 minutes after sundown my wife and I were in the back yard.  The sky was clear, half moon very bright.  Light from the sun was still glowing in the western half of the sky.  No stars were visible yet. My wife pointed to a very bright star almost directly overhead.  It was a Venus type brightness.  I realized that it was too early for stars and is Venus currently visible at dawn.  I then assumed it was a satellite reflecting sunlight which we often see.  I quickly realized if it was a satellite it had to very large, like the International Space Station which we are familiar with.  The ISS is not visible for us at this time.   I immediately recognized the \u201cstar\u201d object was not a satellite because it seemed stationary almost directly overhead.  It was absolutely not moving across the mid-point of the sky at the pace we often seen evening satellites moving. Looking at the object for ten plus seconds it suddenly became several times brighter.  The new brightness lasted about five seconds and then quickly dimmed to less brightness than it was originally.   A few seconds later a white cloud appeared around the star like object.   We describe the size of the cloud as 20-30 diameters of the \u201cstar\u201d object.  I arrived at that diameter simulating the size of the \u201cstar\u201d object with an ink dot and thereby extrapolating the size of the cloud.  The cloud was semitransparent rather that a very solid white; however it was definitely white.   Suddenly a bright \u201cstar\u201d like object moved out of the cloud area at an angle to the right and from our perspective it appeared to be moving downward as if falling toward earth.  The \u201cfalling\u201d object was far less bright than the original object. I had my cell phone in hand so I dialed 911 to report the sighting in case it was some type of high altitude explosion.  The cloud and falling object were visible as I made contact with the 911 operator and gave my report.  The cloud and then the object faded from view while I was still on the phone, which I assume was about a minute. I checked the exact time of the sighting by my cell phone record of the 911 call. After the sighting faded, I looked around in the sky and because of the fading sunlight, there were no stars or planets visible.",

My wife was in the passenger seat.  I witnessed a blue meteor directly through my front windshield just to the left of my rear view mirror.  I started to point and tell my wife there was a meteor and then it stopped in place.  She asked me why I was pointing at a star and I told her it could not be a star.   The object appeared to have come from the northwest and traveled across the sky rapidly like a typical meteor only it stopped suddenly.  It stopped in the western portion of the sky about a quarter of the sky up from where the sun would set before I lost visual.  There was no fluctuation in the light at all and no tail.  There were no blinking lights only solid blue like a bright star.  I told no one about this except my wife who was with me.   The next day on Facebook a few friends mentioned seeing a blue light in the sky behaving oddly so I knew it was not just a onetime fluke.",

I was approximately 11 years old, staying overnight at a friend's house, \"camping out\" in his back yard.  My friend had fallen asleep quite suddenly, and I heard what sounded like an animal shuffling around in the grass outside of the tent.  Normally this would not have scared me, but for whatever reason, it did, just then.  I turned and looked at the screen in the tent flap and saw a head, shaped roughly like a football on its side, looking in at us in the darkness.  It realized I was looking and quickly dropped out of sight.   At this point I did what any normal person would do - I covered my head.  I looked out a couple of minutes later (so I thought) to find it was mid-morning.  My friend was still asleep, and I was thoroughly confused.   I have no idea what I saw that night, and no idea what happened in the time from covering my head to the next morning.  Again, it seemed like a couple of minutes, but was actually hours.

As I looked up at the brightly lit full moon, my eye was immediately drawn to the brilliant blue sphere.  I immediately pulled out my phone and captured a picture, time stamps on phone show the first picture taken at 20:11. At one point I ran inside to retrieve my digital camera.  I was inside for about 3 minutes.  I rushed back outside to continue taking more pictures and video.  I continued to observe the object for approximately 20 minutes.  During this time, I observed the blue sphere moving around in the night sky (screen shot of pics on my phone shows various locations).  My attention was still focused on the round blue object. I went inside and downloaded the images on to my computer to review. After spending time on my computer, I went out to the backyard to take one last look.  To my surprise, the object was still visible in the night sky.  I took another photo at 22:27 of the blue sphere. When I later viewed my pictures and video I saw other objects, what appears to be flying metallic objects.

((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the still photos that have been forwarded to our Center by the witness.  The small, blue-green object in those photos seems to us to be strongly reminiscent of lens flares, caused by pointing a camera at a bright source of light.  However, if the witness did, in fact, see the object with her normal vision, the objects are not lens flares, which are caused by reflections off the surfaces of the lens elements in the objective lens of a camera.
