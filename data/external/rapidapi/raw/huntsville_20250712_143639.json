In the sky over Huntsville or Redstone Arsenal, I noticed 2 bright yellowish lights and one blinking red light and did not hear any airplane or helicopter noise.  The yellowish lights appeared to be moving slowly, very close but in different directions.  After about 30 seconds they disappeared (not simultaneously, but separately).   It might have been some kind of a firework trail the way they faded from view, but it took a full 30 seconds for them to disappear and neither light moved downward.   After they were gone, I watched the blinking red light move toward the southwest over Redstone Arsenal toward the Huntsville Airport for an additional 30 seconds until it was obstructed from my view by a large tree.  I continued watching for 10 minutes but never saw the bright yellowish lights or the red blinking light again.  If I were to guess, I would suspect either some satellite-related event or two helicopters that turned on and off their lights too far away for me to hear them.  I suspect the red blinking light was a satellight",

Out of nowhere, a ball of white light descended, and then leveled off moving East, going away from me.  From my vantage point, I would say the object was about the size of a \u201cBB\u201d held at arm's length to the eye, for lack of a better term it was pulsating and becoming brighter, making it look somewhat larger then back to smaller.   I cannot estimate its speed or altitude, but from where it first appeared, to where it finally went out of my sight behind the other building, I would say it came from an extremely high altitude.

      "story": "large triangular object near UAH in Huntsville, Al moving very slowly with no sound I was coming home from work going down University Dr. east toward UAH when I saw in the horizon just above me in the distance two large bright lights.  The lights did not appear to be moving or moving very slowly.  My first thought was oh a airplane. But then immediantaly I said no that is not an airplane because the two lights are way to far apart to be an airplaine and there was no blinking light on it like airplanes have.  The two lights were probablly 3 times the wing span of an airplane accross.  I kept watching the lights as I went down the road and the two lights were fixed to each other and not making hardly any movement.  Then I turned off university to go to sparkman and just as I was right near uah I looked up and ther was a huge traingle shaped craft above my head.  It was grey and black in color and I could see it very clearly.  It had a red light on the bottom.  I kept traveling and as I turned north onto sparkamn I saw the lights moving to the northeast I could no longer make out the triangle shape I just saw the two widespaced huge lights.  This event caused me to call the 3 local tv stations and ask if any one had reported seeing a triangle in the sky.  The respone I got from all 3 stations was no.  They did not seem to even want to know what I had seen.  At this point I started to doubt what I had seen bec there was a lot of traffic on the road and someone else had to have seen it.  The only thing that makes me think I did not just imagine it is that I watched it for about 5 min.  before I actually was underneighth it and saw the shape of it.  My impression is that it may be some kind of exp aircraft because we live right near redstone arsenal.  The object was not making any really unsual movement except that it did not appear to move at all but hover or move very slowly and I heard absolutely no sound coming from it.

      "story": "Bell or thimble shaped object rises out of Guntersville Lake and follows pair into Huntsville. Late one evening (between 9 and 10 PM) in the winter of 1988 (possibly February), I (a high school student) was sitting on a boat dock at Guntersville Lake with one other person (a high school student) when a large bell or thimble shaped object rose from the water about  a quarter of a mile from us.  It rose straight up (higher than the tree line) and stopped. Too close for comfort, we got into our car and drove rapidly from the lake taking Hwy 72 through Scottsboro to Huntsville (a trip lasting approximately 35 minutes).  The object followed us just above the tree line rapidly moving from one side of the road to the other.  The object was bright enough to be seen through the street lights once we reached Huntsville and followed us on a twisting path through town. We stopped at my house near Redstone Arsenal and gathered up a pair of binoculars and a rifle scope to look more closely at the object that was now hovering over the neighbor\u2019s house.  We were joined by my father (a restaurant manager) and a neighbor (profession unknown), and we all watched the object for approximately ten minutes.  It was bell or thimble shaped with varying colored lights around the outside of the object in a diagonal line from the bottom to the top.  It rotated counter clockwise and was light in color.  After ten minutes or so, the object rose rapidly and sped off to the southeast. I saw several strange luminous objects in the skies over Redstone Arsenal in the spring and summer that followed- often the same objects in the same general area several nights in a row--but none came close enough for me to distinguish their shapes.

I have detect a ufo in the ground and it has been here a very long time. I have found only (1) thing that is evidence that the ufo was there. Over time what I found was that one ufo was only one of a number of them. because the metal is detect in complete shape I have to say that the metal was a alloy that was like ours  becouse any other metal would be found in pieces not complete like what was found.  I do not know why I found it but I did. becouse it is complete it is like a blueprint and you can tell how it would work . It being the large one is so large you would think that it would hold a lot of there poeple, but when you look at the print , you see that only the core of it would hold life. the outer part it like ballast tank, this allows it to go to the bottom of water. It has in the core (7) riser that lets it rise without vacum damage it. This design shows that they use all of nature to do things. What I see of there design, If they have it they use it. In march 0f 06 I saw one that was flying . It was only a cicle of light very bright< but looking at it this llght must be very cold to be this bright. becuase they donot have anything that donot use , why have the light. We donot think that they need light to see so WHY HAVE IT. I now know more about ufo,s then I need to know. but am having the same problem that most people have that has see them, Is it because we are unwilling to say that they were here and still here, I donot know but I am happly  to know that I have the luck to studies them, there is a lot to know but I understand you are not going to read it all.

The magnitude and color (white like that of a satellite) of the light of the object was constant, and there was no tail behind the object, nor trail left in the sky following the object.  The object, at first, appeared to travelling roughly parallel to the ground, but as it moved away from me, it looked as though it had changed trajectory toward the ground and that it might impact somewhere on the Redstone Arsenal.  No impact was observed.  No sound was heard.  A small aircraft was flying from north to south at the time of the sighting and the object would have been visible to the pilot through the right-hand window.  My vantage  point is high above the city (approximately 600 feet) and visibility was unlimited.  The sky was perfectly clear with good astronomical seeing conditions.  I would estimate the object to have had a constant brightness of approximately equivalent to a star magnitude of 3 to 3.4.

There was a very thin cloud layer in the sky that did NOT obscure the stars.  The object was above this layer and I attribute its hazy appearance to that fact.   The light moved rapidly from a higher to lower altitude and seemed to follow a trajectory that made an angle of about 30 degrees with the ground.  From my vantage point at approximately 1250 feet in elevation, it appeared that the object was about 5 miles, or so, distant, and located over the Redstone Arsenal.  The object covered a large arc of sky in the very short time in which I viewed it.  The object gave the impression it would impact the ground somwhere south of my location.  I can see about 40 miles due to my mountain-top location.  I waited for several minutes for a sign of impact, but saw none.  The Alabama counties in which an impact could have taken place are Morgan and Marshall.  No sound from the object was audible.  I had attributed my sighting to a meteor, until a local newspaper ran an article about a similar sounding object that was seen a day later at a much earlier time (11/28/06 at 17:28).  Search lights, flares, rockets, missiles, and aitcraft are unlikely explanations for this object.  Humidity in the air would make search light beams visible and the shape of the spot on the clouds would have changed due to the angle of the light source.  The object maintained constant shape.  The apparent altitude and angle of sky covered would likely indicate supersonic velocity and probably a sonic boom, especially if the object had to avaoid collision with the ground.  The sudden appearance and disappearance of the object, and its constant luminance would also help rule out the other possibilities I mentioned.",

      "story": "woman figure in red bodysiut with large head   Sometime during 1981 I had a dream that has not left my memory.  I now believe it was not a dream but an abduction experience.  This occurred in Huntsville, Alabama at night. I have three memories: I was placed in a seat that looked like plastic similar to fast food restaurants.  It was curved and had a high back that protruded above my head.  I was not belted in the seat but I was stuck there and could not move.  My eyes were open but unable to move so I could only see in front of me.  There was a man sitting across from me in a same type of seat, and he was not moving either.  I could see more seating behind him but with the design I could not see anyone sitting. The second memory I woke up and was on a table in the middle of a room.   I was laying with my head in the south and my feet in the north.  My eyes could not look around, but I could see part of the ceiling and part of the wall on my right.  It appeared to look rounded and somewhat reminded me of commercial office partitions, grey/silver and flat.  I did not know where I was, then my head rolled to the left and I saw a woman walking up a small ramp to a door that I heard open with a \"swish\" sound, like a hatchback car when you open it.  I could see a little of the hall way and it appeared to curve slightly. The woman was wearing a red bodysuit and seemed to be physically fit.  I saw her head was different, it was larger in the back like it was deformed and her hair was blonde and extremely thin like a chemo patient that is losing most of their hair.  She was on the west side of the room and to the left of me. She had to know I was looking at her from behind because after the door opened she quickly turned and looked at me.  I saw her in the front view before she knocked me back out apparently with her mind, she did not say anything.  Her body seemed human but I have never seen a face similar to her. She had a bigger forehead and bigger eyes than a human, her nose was extremely small, almost no cartilage and reminds me of Michael Jacksons small nose.  Her mouth was small too with very thin lips. The last memory I was in a different seat facing west looking at black windows.  I saw the seat I had been in and it was emply, I still could not look around but I saw a door to the north behind the seat I was in in the first memory.  I was next to the wall and remember the rectangle rounded windows. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date during 1981 is approximate.  PD))",

He had a trailer on the property and we needed some stuff from.  On our way to the dirt road to get to the property I noticed a big bright object below the moon.  I didn\u2019t want time seem weird but it stood out more so, but I thought it was just maybe Venus because it was normal to see Venus kind of big during this time of year.  It was brighter then Venus though and looked like it had three lights from it since it was giving off a very bright glow.  It still has my attention though and I keep my eyes on it, since it looked out of the ordinary and I was just trying to reason with myself. When we got up to the piece of property, my fianc\u00e9 got out of the car to get to the trailer.  I was still watching this object trying to figure out why it was so bright. Then it started to move side to side, up and down, even looked like circles. I was alarmed since I was trying to figure out if I was out of my mind. I tried to debunk it too, but I was seeing planes in the distance flying and I could tell it was a plane too. But I could not tell this was a plane, it started to get closer then further away and it looked like it was flying at an angle to the left and tilted. It was weird. I told my fianc\u00e9 when he came back to the car to sit in the driver passenger seat and look at this. He asked me, \u201cLook at what?\u201d and I replied, \u201cJust come look.\u201d He sits down and I point at the object and tell him to look. I asked him if I was the only one seeing this and he told me, \u201cNo, you are not. I can see it moving weirdly.\u201d He left for a second trip and I told him to hurry since I was still alarmed. The object was still moving in a weird fashion and went out further in distance. It was still in the far distance and looked like it was searching for something. But we left at about 8:30pm and it was still in the far distance, when we hit the main canyon road we could not see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD))",

      "story": "A \"parked\" 737 in the sky accompanied by an orb Yesterday morning at around 9 am when I was driving to Huntsville, I saw a stationary 747 or 737 passenger plane parked in the sky about 100 feet above a field just to the right side of the road.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me at first because the car was in motion and I was definitely driving towards the nose of the plane, but as I got closer I realized that it was truly just sitting there parked in the sky.  To its right (my left) was an orb dancing around in the sky.  It seemed to reflect the sky on all its \"sides\" and appeared perfectly round and solid.  It was no bigger than a person would be if they were curled up in a ball.  When I realized that it was indeed parked in the sky, I pulled over and snapped a photo with my digital cell phone camera.  It isn\u2019t that great but I have it if anyone wants to see it, and I will try my best to get it to sharpen in photoshop, but the actual raw photo taken at 9 am on 1-9-09 is in an email I just sent to this site.   The exact location of the craft was approximately \u00bd mile north of the Toyota plant in Huntsville on Pulaski Pike Rd.  I don\u2019t know why it chose this location because there is only a field full of llamas and alpacas, some donkeys, horses and cows.  There is also a stream near by with fish in it.  Maybe it was surveying the area or something I don\u2019t know.  But after I took the picture I was beside myself.  Back in 2000 when we lived in Texas, the whole family (kids, me, hubby) saw the exact same thing.  A large passenger plane parked in the sky, about the size of a 737 or 747, and it too was parked so low you could see every detail of its wings, engines, windows, paint job.   This one yesterday was painted with a silver grey bottom and orange on the sides (like a Northwestern Airlines plane).  It had no \"underbelly\" rocket boosters or anything, there was no way in the physical world it could have been hovering because passenger planes that are made to stay in flight while moving at 600 miles an hour simply drop to the ground if they are! motionl ess. About 30 seconds after I parked the car, it started to go away (I guess the occupants saw me?)  It went slow for about 5 seconds then disappeared going in an upwards north easterly direction very fast.  Also, the sphere that was dancing around everywhere disappeared.  Oh and the weather for the sighting was perfect, 100% clear sky, no clouds anywhere.  9 am, broad daylight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere, and quite credible.  We have looked at the photo, taken with a cell telephone, and the objects is reminiscent of a swept-wing airliner.  It is ambiguous, we believe, but the witness has volunteered to send NUFORC the same photo, after it has been \"processed\" by a photo lab.  PD))",

It was due west from our back porch.SO I came out to take a look.  It appeared to be over Huntsville Texas.   In a 2 hour period this thing hovered,went in circles horizontaly, pulsed in brightness and in size. It moved VERY quicly back and forth stood perfectly still and shot out something that shined very brightly at least twice, we both saw it happen the 2nd time.  Then the ejected object invisible, turned off its lights or burned up. As the time went on, it dropped lower than our trees.  We lost sight of itat approx 1AM.  I sat in my chair and anchored myself, because I thought maybe  My eyes were playing tricks on me.  But they were not!  This was definalty not a plane, not a helicopter, not a star, not a planet.  It appeared to have a glowing aura around it at times and I did see beams, now I dont know if that was coming from the craft or from a helicopter around it that might have been flying without its running lights.   The night was perfectly clear and it was in my sight for at least 2 hours. I hope others saw this and report it too!",

      "story": "Large orbs moving at a steady altitude and velocity We witnessed a total of four occurrences of visitor activity on the 4th of July 2010 in the Lake Forest Subdivision of Huntsville Alabama.   At 8:50 PM we saw a single large reddish orange glowing orb coming from the south moving slowing northward; it was very low, maybe 250 to 300' above the rooftops.  There was absolutely no sound being emitted from the illuminating sphere.  We watched it for about 5-10 minutes as it passed over our neighborhood and then got into our car and drove to the gas station at the corner of Martin and Zerdt roads.  We could see fireworks off in the distance so we sat in the car for about 15 minutes and watched.   As we drove home heading west on Martin Road, we saw a formation of 3 glowing orbs.  This time I really thought, hey these things are extraterrestrial and I want to make sure there not hot air balloons or helicopters.  So we slowed down to almost a complete stop, rolled down the windows to see if we could hear helicopter blades, but there was no sound at all.   And they were not hot air balloons.   We had traffic behind us, so we had to move on and we are not sure where they went, but assume they continued to move northward as did the first one.  We were sitting outside and then around 10 pm we saw one more solitary glowing orb, but at a higher altitude than the others and this one was either blinking, or something behind it was blinking and we watched it move northward as well, then the dog barked, we looked away and when we looked up again it had disappeared.   Then about 15 minutes later my boyfriend said, look at that satellite.  And I said, where?  Then I exclaimed, Wow, did you see that?   He said I sure did, wow!   We saw four distinct bright lights that looked like stars that were in a cluster which was kind of vibrating and then they formed into a line and just zip off into space on at a time very quickly.  It made warp speed seem slow, they just zipped up and off into space and where gone! in an instant.   Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before.  We believe that since the orbs were so slow moving and close to the ground there must have been a number of others who saw the same thing on that clear 4th of July night in Huntsville, Alabama. For the skeptics, I looked up sky lanterns and balloons on-line and just wanted to let you know that there was no way the first one or the second set of three that we saw were in any way sky lanterns. These illuminating things  were huge.  They moved steadily and with a purpose.  Not anything similar to a sky lantern and we were close enough to tell that they were not hot air balloons.   My boyfriend thinks they were as large as a VW bug and my estimate is a bit larger.  They did not flicker and produced an energy glow that was supernatural.   This is the first time I have ever looked at a ufo site and ever posted any such thing.   We are both of sound mind and we were not under the influence that night.   I'd like to know if anyone else has seen large orbs so closely?   Thanks.",

It was highly reflective, I tried to take picture while on my way to work- I could still see it after I got to work way in the distance because the sun was bouncing off it so brightly. When I got home and reviewed the picture I took, I noticed a cloud i had only slightly paid attention to before because it was the only cloud in the sky looked peculiar to AND--Next to the cloud in my picture there are two super bright lights with trails behind them.  My picture of the saucer is so off in the distance you can't really see it bit upon examination the other two lights that I did not see while taking the picture are far more interesting. I took a picture immediately after and the cloud is dissipating and the two bright lights are gone",

      "story": "Three yellow lights surrounding a central red light were seen on a black, presumably triangular shape flying low and silently. As I was driving home from a friend\u2019s house just after 4:00 am during the month of March in 2013, I observed an event traveling extremely low (just above the trees) and silently above my car. I proceeded to stop my car to watch the event. The location was Huntsville, Alabama on Whitesburg Drive between Byrd Spring and Four Mile Post Road. I clearly observed three yellow-white lights in a triangular formation around a central red light. They were on an object (presumably triangular, though I did not have time to discern a clear outline) that I could observe because there were no stars visible between the lights. There was absolutely no sound associated with the event, and I presume it could not have been any sort of conventional aircraft due to this fact and the altitude of flight (again, just above the trees on the corner at which I stopped). The event passed slowly overhead until it passed out of view. I exited my car to look, but I could no longer see the event or any evidence of its passing. Although I cannot estimate the size of the event too accurately, it was well over twenty feet across by my best guess. As a note, I do not tend to acknowledge the existence of extraterrestrials here on Earth, and I know of no sort of powered flight that could run so low and silently. This is why I refer to this phenomenon as an \u201cevent\u201d rather than a \u201ccraft\u201d or \u201cobject.\u201d I can provide no explanation as to the cause of this event, however. I am currently a student studying fields of natural sciences, so I tend to favor no explanation rather than one that is fantastical in my opinion. I am somewhat familiar with what I would categorize as \u201cU.F.O. lore,\u201d but I do not treat it as fact. I have never used illegal drugs, and I was neither on prescription medication nor was I intoxicated at the time of this event. This was my first and only encounter with an event of this type.",

My eyes were glued in wonder as it moved with glee across the atmosphere traveling left.  It didn't make a noise which is why i almost didn't see it.  It blended in with the sky like a 3D effect or maybe 4 or 5D.  Whatever that means.  I could not believe what i had seen.  It was like it defied gravity and that IS what it did.  It was amazing and wonderful to see.  It moved through the sky like that was what it was supposed to do.  Like nothing could tell it nothing.  As if it owned the sky!!  And there were no lights which made it even more unable to see.  It was so smooth.  IT DID NOT MAKE A SOUND!!!  I am truly amazed.  I thought I would never see this...  I always \"knew\" they were true!!  I now have my proof!!  Case is closed.  I was like, \"What is that?\"  It was moving so fast but not like super fast just gracefully fast.  I knew it couldn't be a plane or helicopter.  Birds are that that big and it did not flap.  I only saw it for maybe 5 or 6 seconds. I looked on for maybe 10 seconds more but i couldn't see it anymore though i tried. It vanished into the clouds and blended in so well.  It was gone!!  I did not want it to be. I knew it was gone.

My wife got out with her i-Phone and tried to film it, but because it was so dark, the camera would not focus.   Towards the end of the trajectory, before the stream of fiery objects went behind trees in the distance, we saw one particularly big piece light up into a huge yellow flame.  We tried calling 911 but they were too focused on their script and were no help.

I was surprised to see a V-shaped pattern of lights going from North to South.  There was one lead light and maybe 3-4 lights equally distanced down each side.  It almost appeared that the body inside the object was translucent, it seemed that I could see through it.  I heard no sound and it appeared to be effortlessly gliding across the sky.  It passed over in five to ten seconds.",

So I watched it more closely, it was definitely beginning to move. It first seemed to move towards me (west), growing brighter, but I turned north, and it continued moving in a west direction.  It got so low I could not see it through the trees any longer.  After about a minute it began to ascend and grew dimmer again until I lost visablity.",

Going to Decatur on Hwy 36, beside First Christian Church, I saw a silvery triangular ship with green lights on each corner as it darted just 100 ft. over the tree line.  Wasn't shocked;  I saw a UFO in 1995, a large star-like one that came over our car.  Deadwood, Texas.  Huge and spherical with light from circular ports under the ship.   This triangular one I followed, like cat and mouse.  No lie!  It parked itself over the church and I got out to look.  The following week I was there again, same time, and saw a larger UFO sitting on the hill beside the junk yard as you approach Memorial Pkwy.  I thought it was a new tower with wide lights.  Upon approach I saw a disk ship, almost black, with lights fanning across the front.  Both UFOs sat motionless, hanging in the sky for at least five minutes before darting off to the south.",

      "story": "Thin, gray, wing-like object moving slowly south to north While mowing the grass, I took notice of an object moving in the partly cloudy sky.  The object reminded me of a glider with a very high aspect wing ratio (I would estimate about 25:1), and was a dull gray metallic color.  What I could not discern was any sign of engines, propellers, fuselage, or tail.  It was almost like a thick line, but slightly swept.  It was moving slowly from south to north.   I observed the object for approximately 10 seconds before it went out of view behind some trees.  It was only faintly visible due to its color, but my polarized sunglasses helped me see it better.  I could not tell its altitude, but it was below the high cirrus clouds, which I estimated to be 20,000 ft based on local air traffic, but above the lower, puffy cumulus clouds.  I tried and tried to see any other features, but there were none.  If it was a glider (I have seen plenty of those) or even a predator drone (we live near the Redstone Arsenal), its fuselage would have been visible, but was not.   Based on my observation, I would place the wing span somewhere around 300 ft, tip to tip. I have attached a rendering of the object I saw to a separate email.
