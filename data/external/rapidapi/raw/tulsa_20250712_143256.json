My son and I sighted 5 objects in the night sky that were independant of each other over a 40 min. span.   We had sighted a vapor trail from an airliner moving east to west and noticed a glowing object approaching the airliner at high speed and accelerate around the airliner and disappear off in the distance. 3 times we observed this from one location.  We then drove home got out the binoculars and lawn chairs and sighted a 4th object moving at high speed east to west, we tried to get a bead on the object with the binoculars but, had a hard time getting a focus because of the velocity at which the object was traveling when all of a sudden it splits off into 3 seperate objects!  One of them appeared to bank off to a due south direction, and accelerate out of sight in seconds, looked like it jumped time. While the other two maintained there same velocity and banked off the northeast \"Stacked on top of each other.\"  We could never determine a shape or clean lines to the objects, they appeared as if they had an ullumination surrounding them that you couldn't make out a distinctness. Sky was exceptionally clear, no wind, probly 68 deg. F. Really neat sighting! Really nice machines!",

      "story": "Wedding Cake Ship Sound was heard 51st and Memorial Drive, South West corner behind what would someday be Skaggs/Albertsons but at the time was an open undeveloped field boarding my neighborhood.   It was very early in the morning, approximately 5AM.  I was awakened by a female presence from my bedroom and I had this desire to get my bicycle out of my parents garage and go riding. The sun wouldn't be up for another hour.   It was the summer.  It was in the 70's, within a month or two of the June 8th, 1974 Tornadoes which destroyed Tulsa, Oklahoma, my home town.  I was outside riding my bicycle in my neighborhood, just 300 yards from my house.  The sun was just coming up.  There was this very unusual popcorn shrimp like cloud formations in the sky.   Just thousands of clouds which were white and puffy alto cumulus like clouds which were spaced out widely in the shape of curled up popcorn shrimp.   The local media weather personality on Channel 8, Don Woods, commented on how rare this day was because Tulsa had never had this kind of weather clouds before in it's recorded history.  I am to believe that this incident may have been just before June 8th, before the T.V. stations were knocked down by the tornadoes.  I have searched and searched for the exact name of these clouds and their exact date and history has buried it.  I can't find it.  Anyway, I'm riding my bike on dark streets back and forth, back and forth, until the sun rises for one hour when I see these clouds.   Their startling clouds.  I can barely find information on the June 8th 1974 triple twister storm which almost took my life and my family's life and left us in ruin for the balance of the year of 1974.  It was truly an awful time with not running water, no gas, no electricity, no phone and no T.V.   All we had was KRMG AM radio to inform the community for quite a while.   AM radios and batteries and lots of kerosene burning Coleman products to make light and cook our food.  As I rode my bike, the sun came over the horizon and you could see all these very strange shaped clouds.   And there were no cars running nor jet aircraft landing.  It was as if Tulsa was frozen. No noise outside at all, not even birds.  And I heard this one noise growing and growing as if it was coming from an aircraft or something up in the air and I began to point my eyes to the direction of this very unique, unearthly noise.  I would hear where it was coming from and move my eyes to the noise as it moved through the skies above me yet I saw nothing.  It flew right over me I would guess at the altitude of a landing jet aircraft and proceeded off to the east.   I kept peddling my bike eastward following the sound and looking up and continued to see nothing as the sound faded away.  This whole encounter did not take just 3 minutes, it was like 25 minutes. It moved as slowly as a Goodyear blimp from the sound as the sound moved in the skies as my ears could track that sound yet I saw nothing and it didn't wake anybody up in the neighborhood. When the sound finally disappeared in the east, I was standing on the ground straddling my bike. Not 5 minutes passed and the entire neighborhood woke up and came to life.   People went out to get their paper, started mowing lawns, dogs started barking, tire sounds of cars were heard on Memorial drive, all the noise of life returned as if somebody just threw a switch.  It was really weird as a 13 year old I actually recognized this and knew major things were wrong here.....  And for some reason, I forgot about this sound.  I just shelved it in my mind and never ever thought about it again.  I never spoke with anybody about it.  Never made it a bid deal.   I also had at the time dreams of being a bird and being able to fly in my own back yard.  I used to dream somebody taught me to flap my wings and I would actually fly around up to 1000 feet high.   And this female person would talk to me then and was like my foster mother if you will. I was encouraged to fly and remember topping the chimney on my parents house and actually flying just above the cloud cover of the town and hovering there for hours at night.  It was always at night. It was a female but I never could remember her face.   But she took a liking to me as a child. And then I never heard anything more from her again.   This whole thing probably spanned just 4 months as I remember.   But I shelved the entire thing and never told anybody.  I also remembered looking into the neighborhood houses for open windows of known Rock and Roll stereo freaks who might have a stereo playing but all windows were shut that I could see and besides, the sound was from above me and slightly to the south heading west to east in direction as it moved.  It also wasn't the kind of sound which was played back from a recording with hiss or scratch sounds like a record does, it was the REAL THING SOUND.  It had the decibels of a powerful engine or something like that.   There was no stereo which could make a noise that loud which was obviously far up in the air somewhere up there.  It also gave me the feeling that somebody was looking down on me, the one kid outside with the bicycle chasing this sound and not being able to catch it and I felt this terrible, awful sorrow coming from somewhere as if a family member was either just abandoned or died or perhaps the feeling you get when your best pet dog is killed in a violent way.  A very sorrowful, sad feeling which actually made tears come to my eyes finally as the sound finally went away to the east and was never heard from again.  I had the feeling that I was just abandoned like a mom would say goodbye to here child for the last time never to see him ever again.   There was a sense of concern and fear and I remembered now, at the time I was led to believe I was going to have a very hard and challenging life.  I was 13 years of age at this time.  Lost in space had been on T.V. and the sound of that spaceship in that T.V. series was Erie but not similar to this sound.   This sound was not man made it was real.  And so I grew up, and time just buried all of this.  I never heard this sound again and forgot about all this until recently.  I'm 46 years old now.  I'm driving across country and the AM radio is on.   Coast to Coast AM is playing and George Noory.  He's interviewing Michael Horn.   Michael Horn is supposed to be the U.S. press representative of Billy Meier from Switzerland.  And I listened to this interview they did and somewhere in the middle of it they played the wedding cake ship sound.  I said to myself as soon as 10 seconds of this sound was played that I've heard this before somewhere??? And I began to ask myself which T.V. show or Movie did I hear this sound on before so I could know where these guy's ripped this sound off from.  I eventually went to the website and downloaded this sound and played it a few times and it all started coming back to me.  I was asking same question back in 1974.  I remembered that morning.  I remembered the weird bicycle ride I took that summer morning.  Asking the question is this sound was coming from a neighbors house, what T.V. show or movie  did they get it from.  Yet I knew it wasn't coming from a neighbors house or some passing car's 8 track.   This is 1974 you see, not even the cassette tape was popular then.  Microwave ovens and cable T.V. were years off.  Color T.V. was just getting popular.  FM stereo existed but not widely used in cars yet.  Cars still typically had noisy AM radio with 8 track players bolted on.    We didn't even have synthesizers in that era to manufacture a noise like this.  But I heard this damn noise.  I felt those feelings.  I had those dreams in my sleep of flying with my other mom.  I felt some love from this person.  And I have some post comments to make to this female person, whoever it was. After having done some years research on Billy Meier and the Pleiadians and finding out that these people frequent all of our media and are somewhat experts on Human current events. If what I have read and felt are indeed true, then I'm dealing with an emotional being who's not learned to separate herself from her science projects....    And I'm sorry you never had a child. And while it's sad that you people actually read the contact reports from this very website, maybe you'll read this one and remember what you did back in 74.  I know it was you and I shake my head and ask the question if you leave that much concern in a 13 year old childs mind how are your possibly going to help mankind?  It was the certain knowledge and admission that this sound was the Wedding Cake Ship. That the Wedding Cake ship was commissioned at around this time.  And I'm left with the question, why Tulsa, Oklahoma?  Was it the knowledge we were about to be greased by a large group of Tornadoes?   Was there something special about me? All I'm personally left with is she decided to adopt me as her son for a few months and perhaps study me, I guess...  I dunno....  But I did hear that Wedding Cake ship sound on that popcorn shrimp cloud day which we have never had again, ever.... ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.

      "story": "October, 1961, Tulsa Oklahoma: low altitude, slow, disk object(s); high speed turns, v. high accelleration. I was delivering newspapers at approximately 3:30 AM, October 1, 1961, (plus of minus a week), on North Braden Avenue at the corner of East Marshal Street.  It was cold (30-35F) and the sky was clear of clouds. Two circular, saucer-shaped objects flew over me in a North-East direction, generally headed toward the Tulsa airport approximately two and a half miles away.  My estimate at the time was that they were flying at about 250 feet altitude, and were about 80 feet across.  It was relatively easy to judge the distance, as the edges of the saucers were crisply in focus.  There was very faint scoring or scratching on the bottom surface of the saucers, giving a slight textured appearance, which also allowed me to judge altitude better.  They flew at approximately 15-20 MPH (very slowly), and in line (one behind the other, same altitude).  The bottom of the saucers glowed with a golden light that pulsed slowly, in about a 2-3 second cycle from dimmer to lighter and back to dimmer.  The pulsing was very distinct, but not the cycle was not \"wide,\" in that it was never particularly bright, and always a bit dim.  The saucers were completely silent.  There were no \"point\" lights, or particular light emitting locations except for the whole of the under surface. The location was very slightly hilly, and the saucers proceeded in a direction directly in line with the street.  I would watch clearly them until they had flown about a mile and a half away.  As they receded, it became apparent that the main bodies of the saucers had the appearance of two thin spherical surfaces, one above and one below, meeting at the edges.  Given the estimate that the saucers were 80 feet in diameter, I estimate that the main body of the saucers were 8 feet thick. The main body of each saucer was surmounted by a translucent (opaque) white dome, rising approximately 4 feet above the main body.  The dome was only a little brighter than the golden bottoms.  There were no \"point\" sources of light on the dome.  I do not recall that the top surface of the saucers, apart from the domes, glowed; however, it is likely that they did glow only a little dimmer than the bottoms or I would have noticed either that they were dark or that the saucer bodies were uniformly bright, top and bottom.  I do not recall that the dome lighting pulsed. It is possible that my size estimates are too small.  It is possible that the saucers were instead, 125 feet across and 12 feet thick in the main body with a 6-7 foot dome, flying up to but not exceeding 400 feet in altitude.  These sizes are an upper limit and unlikely. At the time I was skilled in aircraft recognition, having been growing up with a parent who was employed at the Tulsa Airport and who kept me well informed about airplanes and air flight mechanics.  I was also a relatively skilled hunter, with a good sense of distance for estimating bullet trajectories for high powered rifles. Naturally, I thought this to be an extraordinary incident, and so I kept my eyes on the sky for many mornings thereafter.  Subsequently, within two or three weeks I saw another saucer, which I will report here as part of the same incident. I was standing at the corner of East Pine and North Yale, approximately half a mile North of the previous sighting, and saw a saucer fly overhead in a South-West direction toward downtown Tulsa, 4 miles away.  The location was elevated sufficiently so that I could see the downtown skyline.  The saucer was the same size and shape, but this time flying silently at 750-1000 feet altitude at perhaps 200-250 MPH.  It glowed with a golden pulsing light, as had the two saucers in the previous sighting. Within perhaps 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, the saucer passed just even with or to the other side of the downtown region and turned Northward at probably the same speed.  From this distance it was a little easier to estimate the altitude, as the profile of the saucer was relatively clear, although distant and therefore a small visual object.  The saucer flew Northward for about a mile, until more or less directly East of me, then abruptly changed both direction and speed.  The saucer abruptly veered upward at about 25 degrees -- a \"point-turn\" with no curvature to it that I could detect from where I was.  It abruptly increased in speed to what I would estimate to be about 1500 MPH.  I judge this to be the speed from the prior assessment that it was going 250 MPH, and was not going 6-8 times that speed, upward at the 25 degree angle.  It seemed that the saucer accelerated from 250 to 1500 in not more than a few hundred feet, if it took even that distance.  For all I knew, it was instantaneous, since one or two saucer-body lengths in acceleration to that speed would have been indistinguishable from instantaneous.  The saucer continued upward rapidly until I could no longer see it. Within one week more, I saw something that I presumed to be a saucer, also.  From the same location at Pine and Yale, I looked into the sky Southward and a little East, and saw high into the sky (about 55-60 degrees elevation) what appeared to be a meteor entering the atmosphere -- a not uncommon sight.  However, this meteor began to glow, then streaked down at about 150-160 degrees downward Upper Left to Lower Right in my vision, then abruptly slowed and stopped in place, still glowing brightly from what I thought to be heated entry into the atmosphere.  After remaining completely still for approximately 10 seconds, it flew off horizontally to the horizon, Eastward (probably South-East from its stopped position) and disappeared into the distance.  I could not see features on this object, nor its shape.  The event was probably 8-10 miles distant, perhaps in an area 1-3 miles West of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. These three events were the only ones I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

I ran through the house to get to a better vantage point, but by that time all three objects were gone.

      "story": "A strange, changing shape UFO over Tulsa. \tOkay, it all started when I was on my rooftop.  I had my binoculars with me (if it weren\u2019t for the binoculars, I wouldn\u2019t have seen this object.)  I was viewing a large plane with them that was high in the sky (either a Boeing 767 or 777).  As I was following it, then it happened.  The time was approx. 2:50 PM. I spotted this weird looking circle craft in the sky (it looked like it was supposed to be a disk) but it was changing because the outline of the craft had wrinkles in it.  It continued to make these weird outlines by wrinkling the outline of the craft.  The craft had no sound (that\u2019s the common thing for all UFOs).  The color looked like a silver color.  The size, well, if it was on the edge of space, then it must have been something pretty massive for me to only see with my binoculars.  I checked the binoculars for debris, but none was present.  It wasn\u2019t a reflection because this \u201ccraft\u201d entered my binoculars.  I am familiar with the way weather balloons look in the sky (perfectly circle, white, going up pretty fast).  But this was no weather balloon.  It wasn\u2019t a perfect circle or completely white.  It was what I said up there.  I also know it was not a shopping bag because even a slight bit of wind could not carry it that high or keep it hovering like that.  It was way up there because when the plane passed by it, then the object was behind the plane.  It came from behind the plane (not by itself, but by the plane moving).  I took the binoculars off my eyes, and I couldn\u2019t see the object with my naked eye.  I tried to find it again, but I lost the object.  It wasn\u2019t a balloon because later, for another 10 seconds, I saw it.  A balloon wouldn\u2019t stay for another 15 minutes (I had come outside later). Later, at approx. 3:15PM (25 minutes later), I went back outside and looked in the sky with my binoculars at another, smaller airliner.  The smaller airliner was just as high as the other plane was earlier.  The object came into the screen again, only this time, much higher.  It was in the same spot as it was earlier.  It was doing pretty much the same things as it was earlier.  It looked like it was slowly but surely going up.  The sighting ended after that.  \tI never thought that I would see anything like this.  I have heard many things on the news, but I didn\u2019t believe some of them.  I did, however, see the Stephenville, Texas sightings in January on the news.  I believed it.  The only thing that made it hard to believe was when the object returned, they reported 2 noisy fighter jets chasing the noiseless, triangular craft at high speeds.  I don\u2019t know if that part is true.  I have believed in UFOs ever since I was younger.  What made me believe in them was when I heard about a case on the news or something.  I believe that some of them are either ET, angels, or something like that.  I don\u2019t know why they are here.  If this was a real craft, then this is amazing.  This is all that I have to say about this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

The lights then turned to red and blue on the side and it all of a sudden took off and was gone of sight in probly 15 seconds, the shape was unlike anything i had seen before.  Then last night technically this mornign may 15 at 12:30 am i was driving home from a friends house and spotted it in the exact same spot,  i called the friends i had been with last time told them it was back and to get a camera i picked up my first friend then got to the house with the camera, at the exact moment the object was flying over my friends house literaly 200 yards above us, we tried to pull out the camera but it was going to fast we halled through the neighboorhood and got some ok shots of it flying away.  Any way thats 2 times in 3 nights we have seen it and now have a little footage of it, it is the strangest thing i have ever seen, it is kind of a circular shape proble 3 or 4 times the size of a car not very big at all.  We are going to look for it again tonight and i will be back to post if anything else happens.",

      "story": "Light far away in sky racing away from a location & back twice to again race away and not return This sighting corresponds quite closely to a sighting reported in Salina, Kansas, on 09/20/73. I have estimated a date/year in which this occured.  I am unsure if it was indeed 1976. It could have been 1975. First off, I am a realist.  I don't fall easily into the ghost/UFO sighting scene, but I know what I saw and it was very unexplainable. I was in my bedroom at approx. 2245 hrs. and just laying in my bed looking out the window when up in the sky in a west southwest direction I observed what at first I thought was a possible satellite.  I was in Boy Scouts at the time and we would always point out a certain satellite that would bounce up and down and change colors.  This object did not change colors but was moving up,down, and back & forth.  Then it raced away towards the North completely out of sight and at an unimaginable rate of speed, but within seconds came back to the approx. area in which it first was.  It then raced off again at an incredible speed and returned again, but this time it came back from a different angle.  Again, it raced off which looked to be a diagonal direction upwards but again to the North.  It never returned. I remained at the window for at least an hour just hoping it would return. My next door neighbors were out of town visiting family in Topeka, Kansas. When they returned, I informed my friend what I had seen and overhearing me was her mother. She informed me that while they were in Topeka that some neighbors of their relatives also saw the exact same thing in the sky. I am now 43 years old and a Deputy Sheriff.  At the time, I was approx. 9-10 years old.  This sighting has always bothered me since that time.  I read all these fantastic reports and they sound really silly.  But what I saw was totally genuine and I would really like to know of similar reports of this sighting.  I can't be the only one that saw this.  If in Kansas it was also seen, then I would think many people also saw it.  I am very determined to investigate this occurance just to possibly get some answers.",

      "story": "It was maybe 500ft above me, no lights, traveling VERY slow,  and completely silent. I was 18 at the time, and a senior in high school.  I was working at a mall in Tulsa, OK.  I had just left work around 10pm to go over to my girlfriend\u2019s house for a few hours.  It was October 12, 1999, and Halloween was fast approaching.  She had decided to go as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. When I arrived at her house, she was outside gluing glitter to a pair of red heels for her costume.  I sat on her front steps with her while she did this.  When she was done, I suggested that we lie in the driveway and look at the stars.  It was relatively warm for that time of year, and the sky was as clear as can be. We got up and moved to the driveway.  As we lay there, looking at the stars and talking, I noticed something disturbing the night sky.  It was moving VERY slowly, maybe 100MPH or less.  The object was very low to the ground.  My guess is between 500ft and 750ft, but no more than that.  There were no lights, and no sound.  I could make out the silhouette of the object against the distant light pollution and the stars in the background.  It had a long fuselage with bulges to the side, kind of in the shape of lobes, where the cockpit might be, and at the back of the object.  The bulges to the side were smaller in the front than in the rear.  It had a slight glow behind it, though not like a jet.  I asked her if she was seeing what I was seeing.  She saw it as well.  We watched as the object slowly and silently moved through the night sky until it was out of sight. The fact that stood out to me was the complete lack of sound.  As a child I frequented air shows.  I was quite aware of the immense noise produced by a conventional engine, be it propeller or jet.  I had seen an F-14 perform a fly by at 100MPH once.  It was greatly pitched with a tremendous amount of thrust, and was loud enough to wake the dead.  What we saw that night was lower, slower, and not pitched at all. I don\u2019t think it was alien spacecraft, but the technology was nothing known to exist to this day.  A few weeks later I saw a show on TV about the \u201cAurora\u201d, the top secret space plane.  The supposed shape of the Aurora, according to the show, was nearly identical to what we had seen.  My guess is that we may have witnessed a test flight of this plane.  The only thing that keeps me from being sure of that is that there were no lights on it.  I know the US puts lights on all aircraft, even test planes.  We\u2019ve seen this with the F-117.  This Unidentified Flying Object is wholly worthy of the title.  Not a flying saucer.  Not cigar shaped.  Not a light that moves at break-neck speed.  It was just an unidentified, slow flying, silent object.",

We were down in an urban ravine, just hanging out and talking like friends do. I was the first one to look up and, in awe, see the unidentified flying object. I couldn't tell you how large or high up it was. All I know is that it was humongous, completely silent, and cruising slowly yet stealthily. Its luminous, phosphorescent lights made its shape out to be triangular or boomerang-like in nature, although the craft itself seemed to be cloaked. The whole spectacle lasted approximately ten to fifteen seconds until it just vanished. One of my friends later told me that he felt like he was being watched when it flew by. My other friend simply dismissed it as either a skein of geese, a weather balloon or swamp gas. But I know what I saw, and I'm sure that it wasn't either of those things, especially since another witness told me that three helicopters, \"two 'regular,' and one black,\" were scouting the area soon after the UFO had disappeared.

      "story": "Witnessed with a friend, a large, rectangular object hovering at sundown in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was about sundown on a March evening in 1989.  I forgot the exact day.  I was riding in my friend\u2019s Jeep and we were heading back to his apartment.  We were stopped at a red light at an intersection heading east.  Up in the Southeastern sky, it looked like a jet airliner was on fire heading down toward Earth.  The smoke and fire cleared after a few seconds and revealed a large, rectangle shaped, solid object.  It had dozens of white lights along the side.  I want to say they seemed to be windows, because the light seemed to be coming from inside the object, not mounted on the outside. The object seemed to be about a football field or so long.  It hovered at treetop level at a fifteen degree angle slowly drifting north about a mile away.  It made no sound. Everyone in their cars at the intersection was freaking out.  All of this took place over about a minute or so, maybe less. It had drifted pretty far North by the time the traffic light turned green.  That's when we saw and heard fighter jets (lights out) screaming toward the object from the far Southern sky.  As we hurried to try to get under it to get a better view, we lost sight of it for a few seconds because of the trees on the left side of the road.  When we got to the next intersection, the jets flew right over us, and we saw the object way down the street.  I could see the back end of it.  I would guess it was about a mile away, moving faster and much higher in the sky now.  We knew we would never catch up with it.  Almost as soon as we saw it, it quickly moved very high in the sky at an unbelievable speed, and it was gone. About an hour later, I went and told my Dad about it, and drew some sketches. We watched the ten o\u2019clock news, as they were going to have a story WITH FILM FOOTAGE of an object seen in the sky that night.  The film they showed was taken by a lady that had been at a local nearby restaurant that evening, and it had that restaurant\u2019s sign in the foreground.  But what they showed looked like a falling star, nothing more.  No word from the dozens of witnesses that saw what we saw.  No footage of the object hovering a hundred feet or so off the ground, or any of the rest of it.  They said it was a \"Russian satellite falling out of its orbit.\"   When those things happen, don't they know about when and where those things will fall?  I'm all the time hearing weathermen saying things like, \"Keep an eye in the Western sky tonight to catch a glimpse of blah blah blah.. Over the years, I've wondered how many other people saw that, and I've wanted to compare notes.  I haven't been able to find anything in any newspaper of TV. archives that even told the story. Since that night, I've questioned everything.  I truly believe the government knows much more than we even believe they do.  I hate to sound like one of those conspiracy freaks, but after seeing undisputable proof that we are not alone, it makes me uneasy to not have the whole story.  Anyway, that's my story, as best as I can remember it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

I was gazing into the sky and saw what looked like a very bright star. I knew it could not be a star because it was so close and the color of the sun. I went online to see if there were suppose to be any visible planets that night, which it said there was so I figured it was a planet. Last night July 12 2009 at 4am I was outside again and saw the same star object in the same place so I assumed again it was a planet in the eastern sky. What caught my attention this time as I was gazing at the planet/star it was moving. I was startled and confused to what I was seeing. It was the same object as I saw before a few weeks ago round bright orange and kind and a lower point to it but not exactly sure, but this time i saw it kind of swaying back and forth. This time I knew what I was seeing was not a planet or star and was not a helicopter because it was way to big to be one. My step dad was here asleep and I decided to wake him thinking maybe he should take a look at this. I woke him and had him follow me outside to show him what I was seeing and it was gone! I told myself planets do not disappear in five minutes and they do not sway back and forth. The night was a clear night, no sign of clouds and this sighting was over a highly populated city. Now that I have seen this object twice I am going to set up a video camera and hopefully will get the chance to get this object on camera.",

The blueish light was horseshoe shaped, with sharpish points.  The orange light was more circular, but not perfect.  The lights faded and came back in intensity as the clouds passed under.  The two lights were directly overhead.  The moon was visible to the northwest and a star was visible slightly northwest.  Eventually, the clouds overpowered the lights, and they disappeared.  Also worth noting, this was near downtown Tulsa so the building lights overpowered a lot of weaker star light.  These lights were far enough above any manmade structure, as well as above the clouds, to be sure that there was nothing that any of us could think of what could be causing it.",

I-75 southbound (near 96th street exit) I saw a VERY BRIGHT \"strip\" of white or bluish white light in the sky to the east. This is very close to the approach used for runways at Tulsa International (Rwy. 18L and 18R). I am use to seeing planes approaching to land at the airport in Tulsa, but this WAS NOT an airplane about to land at the airport. It appeared (as best I can tell) to be about 1/4 mile to my east (no way to reference this distance, just a best guess). It had a dark outline I could not identify well, but then lit up with a VERY BRIGHT strip of white light on it's bottom. The light looked a bit like the expensive xenon headlights used by teenagers in the import cars, as it was almost blue tinted a bit. maybe like a mercury vapor light, but MUCH brighter. It stayed on for about 3/4 of a second and went out, then back on for about 1/4 second. Then, as it was going dark, it started moving away (appeared to be eastbound, but was hard to tell). As soon as the lights went out, I lost sight of it's dark outline and the sighting was over. If i were to guess, i would say this strip of light was at least 100 feet long, but I could see no real shape except that the strip of light was a straight line below a darker craft. When i saw it I immediately got a \"fight or flight\" feeling as adrenaline surged through me and I was awestruck and scared at the same time. I continued the drive to work (no missing time on my commute) and sent this report.",

So I grabbed my binoculars and looked at the object more closely. What I saw was a white, round object made of just one white round light. The object left no trail, had no other lights around it and moved at a fairly steady rate of speed. I watched the object for about 45-60 seconds and all of the sudden, it just flat disappeared.

I watched it for a few moments before it circled back into the storm,  I knew it wasn\u2019t a plane because they can\u2019t move like that.    Right as that one went into the clouds another one shot out of the clouds and then circled right back in.   Could have been the same object, but I never saw them both at the same time out of the clouds.   So after about ten minutes of watching this I see a plane flying slowly from the east in the objects direction, as I\u2019m watching that one another plane comes in really fast from the north I would imagine to intercept the object.   As I look back to see the object it was gone just as the fast moving plane goes into the side of the storm cloud.   The lightning was really bright but it was further to the south of me, I didn\u2019t see any lightning bolt just the flashes through the clouds.

It was brownish red/amber in color and shape was oval- tear drop,hard to explain but I will draw a picture of it.It had some sort of membrane/aura or field around it. Since I already had my binoculars in my hand, I zoomed in on it up close it was squared off in the front like a bay windows yet rounded as it tapered off towards the back,it was totally silent did not make any wild manoeuvres, Stayed at constant speed, no lights or flashing lights at all, it just traveled a straight low line until I could no longer see it.No way was it a balloon, it was a dead air night no wind whatsoever.Left no smoke/com trail.When observed through binoculars the membrane was transparent, and oval in shape.I could see through membrane but the \"teardrop\" shaped craft was solid with defenent shape.I did not panic, felt no fear or anxiety, just intent on details. Plus it was traveling too fast on a horizontal heading.It was not a plane for it had no wings and as close as it was I would have heard the engines, this craft was silent.I would guess the size -30x20x5' towards the back. I honestly can say now that I have seen something in the sky that I can not explain..It was not a satellite, plane,swamp gas,hang glider, balloon,jet,dirigible,shooting star,or helicopter .I know the constellations,I have see MANY satellites and shooting stars, we live in a City with a International Airport so I have seen all kinds of aircraft including stealth military aircraft.By its description It sounds like what a friend and his father saw about the first of June 08.The one they saw was flying at tree top level at a constant speed,with some manoeuvring and in the same area of the city.It also had that weird membrane, was teardop in shape the only difference was the craft they saw was emitting a reddish light and was much lower.I realize this is only anecdotal evidence, one mans story, but I will never forget it and from now I will have a camera along with my telescope and binoculars!",

I went outside to take photos of the incoming storm clouds right before dusk.   At approximately 20:00 (I'm guessing) I took a photo facing North that turned out really nice.  I wasn't noticing any small details in the sky at the time.  I was just looking at the overall \"picture\" as I shot the photo.  A bit later I uploaded the pic onto my computer and noticed something unusual in the photo.  It does not look like an orb, a bug, or a plane, or something on my camera lens, to me.  I don't know what it is, so I will be emailing the photo to you and maybe you can decide?  I'm also sending an additional photo, though you will probably do this yourself ...

This object had no navigational lights and was flying at approximatly 2000 ft and was close enough to us that if it was an airplane we would have heard it,  my parents live pretty much right under where the planes line up to land at Tulsa International when there is a prevailing south wind I checked at work the next day and the planes had been coming in from the north the night before because of a prevailing nothern wind so no planes should have been in the area.  I have worked on planes for 10 yrs and! have never seen anything remotely like this.  The object continued to fly north at constant speed and altitude until it was out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

One was very faint to the naked eye, but i could clearly see it was blinking,  Slowly at times and rapid at times. The second white light was closer and I could make out a red and a blue light on either side of the central blinking white light. The third light was the closest to me, roughly 2 or 3 miles. This light was also blinking what looked like morse code along with the other two lights. This spacecraft, or whatever it was, was definitely a saucer like shape. I could make out the white light that came out of the craft was in a horizontal line that ran around the ship. It also seamed to have multi- colored lights that spun around the craft or center of the white light. All three of these ships sit stationary for a couple hours, this happened three nights in a row.  The first two nights they were in the same place in the sky, the third night they had moved.  But all three nights they seemed to be in a perfect triangle formation.",

      "story": "Armada of Star-like Objects Moving Across Oklahoma Night Sky At approximately 8:08 central time, my son and I were sitting in our van at the intersection of 129th and 71st in the Broken Arrow, Tulsa area waiting for the light to change.  I was driving and we were facing west in the left hand through lane.  There was a moderate cloud cover. While waiting at the stop light my son, who is 17, said something to the effect of, \"Dad, what the heck is that/are those?\"   After a few seconds of confusion in trying to locate what he was looking at in the night sky, I observed what he saw.   With due west as the 12 o\u2019clock position, I estimate that a group of objects were at about the 2 o\u2019clock position about 55 to 65 degrees in elevation from the horizon moving from north to south.  Speed was difficult to assess because we didn\u2019t know how far away the objects were - although while I was sitting at the light which couldn\u2019t have been more than 20 seconds, they had traversed from the 2 o\u2019clock position to about the 11 o\u2019clock position in the sky as observed through my windshield. When I first observed the objects I thought they might be fireworks because they seemed to be flickering or pulsing - but then I noted they were moving in unison - although not in a regular formation in the sky.  Then I thought maybe they were lighted, radio-controlled aircraft that I had observed in the past in a field near our home.  But since I knew these planes  moved in a bobbing, irregular manner that did not explain these objects. When they were at the 11 o\u2019clock position I started counting them before the light changed to green.  My recollection was I got up to about a dozen - but my perception was there were even more present - though they were faint.  I think they were at least 15 objects and maybe even up to 30 in the position we were observing them.  The sky was literally peppered with them in portions of that area of the sky.   I perceived the lights to be about the size and brightness of an easily visible star. The amount of sky they occupied would be approximately equivalent to both of one\u2019s hands - or maybe closer to a hand and a half - covering such a section.  The length of the loose formation was greater than its width from what I could see.  I perceived the color of the lights to be a light green - although  my son thought they were more like neon purple.  I thought they were pulsing or blinking in unison at a what I think was a rate of 2-3 pulses per second.  Aaron thought this effect was from them passing in and out of the cloud cover. After the light turned green I caught glimpses of the lights again - although it was difficult to focus on them because I was driving.  Aaron saw them more clearly but we were moving so visual confirmation was difficult to maintain for him as well.  Light pollution didn\u2019t help either.  About a quarter of mile down the road, we turned in behind a school to see if we could still observe the phenomenon but they had apparently disappeared behind the cloud cover or moved too far distant for us to observe them further. I would estimate the total time of the incident to be about one to two minutes from beginning to end of the observation. My son is a student at the local high school and an interested skeptic in such phenomenon.  I am a 49 year old  27 year teacher who has an admittedly avid interest in the topic of UFOs and although I\u2019ve seen some unusual lights in the sky?  None I can\u2019t explain as conventional artificial, meteorological, biological, or astronomical objects - until now.  The only conventional explanation I can think of for these object would be a formation of military helicopters.  They were definitely not airplanes or jets (moving too slowly), birds (unless pigeons have suddenly evolved luminescence in Oklahoma!), balloons, or meteors.",

As I came outside, and walked to the end of our driveway and looked due south, she said look at that.. it looked like two strobe lights in the sky the lower left and upper right lights were intermittently flashing, red, blue, red, red, blue, white, and the flashing pattern was in sync for about 10 seconds my wife said.  She walked to the house called me, I came out and saw them stationary with NO sound.  The objects were at least a few miles in the air about 40degrees up from our vantage point at the end of the driveway.  I came outside saw them stationary... then they two objects started spreading apart... I immediately ran back inside to get my video camera and my $5K Canon 5DMark II digital slr camera! , and tried to take a video... as I got back outside (while my wife kept them in sight), they started moving to the east, south east at about 70-80 miles per hour, and I tried to setup my video camera to catch them... however couldn't focus on anything... I got my SLR camera out and changed lenses to my 70-200... and tried to get a 1080P hd movie going... but couldn't focus on anything... by the time I had the video going... they were at least 6-8 miles away... in less than 2-3 minutes. I had to walk south down our street to view them through the tree line.. and could still make out the blue, red, blue, red, white, blue, red, alternating flashing....  my wife was videoing and trying to see anything while I continued to try to take some time delayed stills to see if I could amplify the ambient light but couldn't.  I was outside watching the flashing until My eyes could barely make out a faint white flashing of 2-3 objects... in the far distance.  This all occurred within abo! ut 6 minutes!!

So I stepped out of my front door that face's west and started to look at the moon as it was setting. Oddly my attention was pulled to the N.W. I saw a red light going toward the airport. I naturally thought it was a plane. Then I noticed there were no flashing lights.  I said aloud, \"Okay... Now I'm watching you..\" Once I had said that it changed from heading East to S.E. then to South.  It was heading towards me.  I stepped further out into the front yard to get a better look as it went above my house.  I quickly ran in woke up my father and grabbed a camera.   By the time I got back outside it was gone nowhere to be seen even from the roof.  Later a plane went by higher up then it was I could see the flashing lights on it and hear the sound as it passed.

The craft was very clear I could see every detail on it.  It had green, yellow and red lights rotating in one direction and the craft itself rotated in the opposite direction of the lights.    As I started panicking and telling my kids to get out of the car and go towards the house I kept my eye on the object and felt as I was been watched by whoever or whatever was inside the craft.  The craft than changed its position from facing straight down to angle view (front part of the saucer facing towards the ground and back facing to the sky) and then it just shot up in the sky and to the side as if I blinked and nothing was ever there.   My kids saw the craft from the car.  The metal of the craft was not ordinary it almost looked as it was see through some kind of liquid metal not of this earth.

At 24:40, Wednesday, April 23rd 2014, I was driving in neighborhood from pharmacy.  I was traveling west on 75th Avenue when I noticed two very bright lights.  I thought it was just another car traveling because the two bright lights moved fluently and very smoothly much like a car with its brights on over the hills.  With so many hills in our neighborhood I thought nothing of it. I quickly realized I was wrong.  The two lights were not coming from a car but from a craft in the sky.  I realized it was a UFO.  The bright lights continued from west to east, fluently, over the trees and then made a right turn.  This turn  i would guess to be a 45 degree turn,  which allowed me to see two sides forming a v-shape.  It was moving at a steady rate of traffic so I would guess it was flying 45 to 50 mph. I turned the corner, heading north on Jamestown, as the UFO was directly past.  I turned the corner and decided to follow.   I was able to keep my eyes on it the entire time as I headed North on Harvard.  I immediately turned left. I could now make out the pyramid shape of the object from radiating off the golf course and also told me the craft  was now at 65th street between Harvard and Lewis.    At Lewis, the craft continued on till Riverside Drive then headed north following the interstate.   I got held up at the light and was unable to see it about a minute later when the five cars ahead of me had turned.   I am certain others had to have seen this UFO in Tulsa and I am guessing it was the same craft that was identified in Kansas. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD))",

So I sat there and waited for it to get closer.  It was low flying, barely above tree top level.  It came about as fast as an airplane taking off would.  When it got close I could see 3 really large Round Bright Green Lights that were not blinking.  It was going South.   When it got to my fence line it stopped and hovered. It was real loud like a lawnmower in the sky. It was so steady hovering there.  I sat there wondering what the heck this thing is? I could not open my door to get a better look, or my Alarm would have went off.  I sat there watching it.  I heard a noise like a transmission would make and those 3 Green Lights rotated counter clockwise and was now Facing East instead of South like they were facing. That was an incredible sight.  The lights literally twirled around fast.  When it turned I now saw a R! ed Flashing Light on the back of this thing and could see about one inch of the Green light lens on one of the lights on the side near me, I knew the lights were still there but now they were facing East.  The craft took slowly off going East now.  This thing had to be black or a dark color cause It was so dark that morning, I could not make out shape of it.  I could not tell what it was. It was not our Police Helicopter or an airplane.  It was not a toy either.  It was too large.  The lights were huge. I live on the flight path of the airport and am used to seeing all kinds of airplanes and helicopters.  Never saw lights like that or a sound like that.  I have spent hours now researching every plane, drone and helicopter I can find and can\u2019t find anything that has 3 Green lights on it that are that large and round and don\u2019t blink.  So wish I knew what it was.   One thing for sure, I saw first hand how these flying crafts change direction so fast.  Apparently they must push a button or a gear and can go from going South to going East real quick.  It must be a new craft too, not many reports of 3 Green lights that are solid and not flashing.  I will never forget what I saw.  It all happened so fast and me being slow at walking, I could not get my camera to take a picture or I would have missed it!",

The sighting was right over the crossing of pole cat creek. up in the sky was a craft with three wings and three sets of wings. The wings were almost like a capital L with another hook on it.   The aircraft was just hovering about 200 feet up.  It was a cylinder type of craft with a sharp front.  The wings of the set of three were aprox 1/3 of the length of the craft.  The wings were almost like frozen.  There was no activity other then the hovering.   At the end was almost like a jet engine but a lot bigger and move developed.  There was also nothing else coming out of this engine no streaks. almost like when you see fumes coming out of an exhaust.  More layers then a regular engine.  The color was almost like a black silk kind of color.  It was somewhat shiny, but still dull.   By the time i got off the exit it was already gone.   There is a lot of plane activity which that is what i thought at first but it was running east to west, instead of running north to south, which the Jenks Airport does.  It was also moving to slow and to low to the ground to be a aircraft.   I'm really not doing this for attention.  I just want to know if anyone else saw what I did, last night.",

At the 4 o'clock  position, it made a severe 90 degree turn south with no indication of banking or change in shape.

The blinking was intriguing, so I grabbed my binoculars. I braced the binoculars against a door to get a steady focus.  The object appeared to be a string of horizontal lights, with red lights blinking somewhere along the middle and another on the left end.  Figured it was a very distant jet, and the sighting was occluded by atmospheric conditions. Over the space of about 45 minutes, the apparent direction of travel was to the east and it may have been moving with the earth's rotation.  Thinking it was a planet (unlikely, as it was well to the north), I double checked with \"in-the-sky.org.\"  All of the planets were eliminated as an explanation. After a total of about 90 minutes, I went back to look again and the object had moved well north and slightly west of its previous position.

I was sitting with my 78-year-old mother and 13 year old son on our back porch. I was looking to the southeast and two green glowing orbs appeared from behind a neighbor\u2019s roofline.  From my prospective, they appeared to be glowing green orbs with a barely noticeable silver edge around one edge of the green glowing circle; as if a sliver of the side of the object was observable.  The silver part seemed solid like it was metal. It is clear that they were several miles away.  They were also very high up.  It was a hot hazy day with hazy clouds high in the sky.  The objects were clearly observed being obscured by the clouds at times.  The two orbs stayed the same distance from each other throughout the observation.  They moved much quicker than an airplane but the movement was steady; not jerking around like perhaps a laser pointer might look. The orbs were heading towards us and the closer they got, the more obvious the details became.  It also was more obvious that the objects were very high up.  Once overhead, my perception was that they were not very big, maybe the size of a car.  At no time did we hear any sound coming from them. A middle aged couple was out for a walk and noticed my family looking at the sky.  They turned around and I asked them to look for the lights.  They saw them too.  We all stood and watched the lights move quickly but steadily towards us and over the house until we could not see them anymore.  My son said that right before they disappeared from our view, they circled each other.  This is the only observation that they broke the formation that we observed throughout.  My son is the only one who saw them circle each other.",

A blue hue appeared behind it around the orange and a whistle sound could now be heard.  The blue diminished and the orange sparks started to lessen.  Front point had turned into what appeared to be a growing glowing white round light which at first was a small circle of light but dark in the center and progressed into being all white light as the Sparks continue to diminish.  By now the whistle turned into a hum that sounded similar to a small aircraft not in distress.  When the orange sparks disappeared the hum continued and all that was left was a blueish or green light and a small gold/white/gold/white light and only for a moment a red light.   From there it proceeded out of sight, trees were blocking my view, looking and sounding like a small aircraft but moving much faster than any plane that I've ever known of and the hum diminished respectively with the sight of it.  It first appeared moving South and barely East from my location as it appeared to drop down and made almost a 90 degrees curve to head East but a little North.  About 1/8 of the way towards North from due East.I don't know latitudes and longitudes.  It did only travel in two straight very distinctive lines.  The turn was maneuvered at the point where the orange sparks were brightest and largest immeditely after the turn is when the blue hue appeared and sparks right after that started to diminish and as the sparks start to diminish is when the whistle turn into a hum.   After the Sparks diminished that's when it turned into the bluish light the flashing light which went dark and the red light which only blinked once left only a bluish-green light.  White circle appeared just barely before the blue hue was completely gone, the white circle was! gone when the lights started appearing in the other colors at! the fro nt point.  The colored lights were in the form of a small triangle with unequal sides when the red light blinked but the white and gold appeared in different relations to the bluish green light. I heard the whistle for about one-and-a-half seconds and about 75% of that time was before the curve and about 25% after.  The curve was made instantly. Same amount of time it would take a second hand on a clock to go to the next second after it started to move but before it hit the next second, that's how long it took the curve to be accomplished. If a possible altitude is necessary I can only guess and that would be it appeared from nowhere to begin to fall from the sky and after the curve would be below the average cloud level. It occurred during a clear night, no clouds and could see stars.  Please reply to this message?  I know I can't leave personal info in a message, but I would like to know what that was or at least that someone has looked into it.  And especially for any questions ! or comments that you might have.  Thank you.",

They all looked see through and like large circles of clouds or white smoke as if they were possibly trying to cloak within the clouds. They literally appeared to be large cloud like circles moving different directions and quickly...we saw about 8 total over 30 minutes. I absolutely believe this to be a UFO and a very strange one at that. They almost looked more organic in nature than like a metal made machine. No lights were seen on or around th! em...they were more just translucent. Three people in my family also saw these and agree they were not only incredibly strange but not of this earth.  This occurred within the city of Tulsa Oklahoma.  I did see a older video post on the UK Mirror that looked very much like the craft saw. These in this post were seen during the day and looked like smoke circles as well.
