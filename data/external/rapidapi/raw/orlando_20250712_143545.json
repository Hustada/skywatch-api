      "story": "Military or other? While serving as an Army officer, I stepped out to my car.  As I was opening the door, a hugh aircraft came overhead.  Probably at least a football field in length.  It passed overhead and out of sight within a second or two and made no sound.  I thought it was just me, but my neighbor across the street had walked outside at the same time I did. We looked at each other and I asked \"did you see that\" and the said very loudly a resounding \"yes.\"   What was also odd was that it made no sound, gave no vapor or other trail.  I've served as a paratrooper jumping out of prop and jet aircraft, been involved in military aviation activities, served as an Army Aviation Brigade Headquarters Company Commander, and also been a student pilot flying in various prop aircraft.  While stationed and living in Orlando, my family and I watched 13 or 14 NASA rocket lift offs from Patrick AFB (1) and from our yard (remaining 12 or so).  Nothing, nothing comes close to the speed and size of this craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date in 2000.  PD))",

I was on a training flight tonight with my instructor just having entered Orlando\u2019s airspace (we were about 15 miles due west of KMCO and just inside their class bravo airspace, when we saw several multicolored flashing lights about 10 miles off the noise of our aircraft.  We Both asked each what the heck is that, the object just hovered at about 4000 ft for about 15 seconds then turned away from us(the lights resembled that of aircraft turning) so I assumed it turned, and within .5 of a second the object warped out I mean It literally went from a hover to light speed we watched as it disappeared (basically the lights just got smaller till it finally disappeared into space.   It is important to note this object went from a hover to out of sight in .5 of a second.   At which point it did that my instructor and me just looked at each other like did you just see that?   I then contacted Orlando approach to ask if there had been any aircraft off our 12 o clock within 20 miles within the past 2 minutes and they replied no we haven\u2019t had anyone on radar.   Obviously this was some sort of stealth aircraft (ufo).   Since I\u2019ve been flying I have never seen anything like this and thought that it would be worth noting",

About 1 am i looked toward the south towards Osceola/St.cloud County I noticed 5 very bright formations. They almost looked like they were stacked upon one another,yet staggered in a corkscrew 45degree angle.  The formation apeared to be one solid object standing still in the distance. The lights on the object were a bright yellow. Each light at some point faded in and out and had reappeared in the formation very slowly but very bright as it reappeared. As I watched this for a good 10mins, the four bottom lights slowly disappeared one by one. The very top light was left it stood alone in the same spot for about 20 seconds. Then like the rest it faded away. Ive never witnessed anything like this and im sure there will be other reports on this U.F.O",

I know we have an airport nearby but this is just like no track once I see it I can't find again in the clear skies.  But yesterday, at 18:30, I witnessed it want wanted to let you guys know.  It's like an airplane size oval shape light that disappears after a few seconds.  Sometimes I keep looking thinking there is a cloud it goes into because that's the sensation that it goes into something in the sky but it just disappears.  I've seen this incident a couple of times this month.   I also noticed this around  17:00  in the Central Florida Parkway maybe a few months ago zip code 32821 facing north same exact shape bright, light shows and in a few seconds disappears as if it was going to a cloud but there is none.  In a way looks like a bigger version to what you ! will experience if you are having a huge migraine the little dots of light you see flashing but bigger like airplanes and only one that goes away in a few seconds by disappearing in the sky. It has been only one single light each time I see it.  I am always observing when I can and I spend 1 to 2 hours driving for commuting so I am aware of my surroundings and look up as well.  No rainy days on daylight all these occasions.  The sun is always to the right when I'm driving from I-4 Close to Conroy Road towards Daytona area.",

It was extremely high, moving extremely fast (we physically had to turn our heads to keep up with it), and flying out of sight within a few seconds.  There was no noise accompanying it whatsoever.  There were also no trails behind the object. I am someone who is skeptical of sightings but this has convinced me.  There could be no other explanation.  Far too high up to be a bird or plane, and it was flying faster than any plane i\u2019ve ever seen.

Me and the 2 other guys I was with shooting pool walked outside to the parking lot but failed to see anything and went back inside. We talked to Randy ( person who called us ) again after going back inside and he said they were more of them apearing and that some of them were hovering in the south. I was so anxious to see this that I jumped on my motorcycle without even paying my bar tab. When I got home I was finally able to see the bright orange balls in the sky. I ran inside to wake the rest of the family up and they too witnessed the orange balls of light. We must have witnessed up to 5 of the objects in the sky at once, sometimes they appeared to be hovering and then would move slowly from the west to the east coast ( cocoa beach florida )up to 20 of them were witnessed. The new ones would come as if someone turned on a light in the sky and once they got far on the east coast out of are atmosphere they apeared to turn light blue almost like a star but continued to fly in mysterious patterns. I called the police to see if there were any other reports of strange orange balls of light in the sky or if the military was testing and they had no answer but yet after talking to my friend Randy that called me he said before I got home from the pub he and his wife and kid witnessed military jets chasing the balls of light. My friend was able to get a couple still frame photos and are in possetion right now. I am really lost for words I have never seen anything like that in my life and I am even a pyrotechnic.

She told us to look and proceeded to pull over.  My mother, siblings and I got out of the car and watched this strange phenomenon.  It appeared that these 17 lights were playing, flying toward each other and away at unbelievable speeds.  Other people coming out of the shopping center looked up to see what we were looking at. Everyone freaked out. Since I was an 11 year old, I remember telling my mother that I thought they were angels playing tag.  It was unbelievable. The lights appeared the same as stars but were much large.  I would say they measured about 90-100 feet across flying at 7000 feet. My mother was so excited that she telephoned my father and told him to come to where we were to see it but they soon flew abruptly upward after pulling into a tight circular formation.",

My mother, her best friend and myself witnessed this craft in its silence hovering so close to the homes roof tops. We were directly across the street from its massive frame. The craft simulated that of a fat boomerang with not pointed edges, and huge in width. We watched this craft for several minutes before having to continue our travel. No writing on the aircraft, my father having been a Mustang Pilot, I was familiar with decals and or writing on wings and body of most aircraft. Undoubtedly, we were all completely startled as this craft and its silence just sat so closely above these homes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

It was 11:45  and I was laying down and watching the stars when I saw it. It was a perfect V shaped set of red lights going right overhead. I believe there were 6 lights on each of the two sides. There was no noise and no strobes. The lights did not change position to each other and the object went across the sky at a moderate speed. This object was quite large, about the size of two full moons. So either it was a very large object at a very high altitude or still a large object at a lower altitude. Either way I did not see any strobes or hear any noise. I have jets fly over my house all the time and it\u2019s quite easy to tell them apart even at night time and this did not look nothing like one. In fact I watch a jet fly over about 10 minutes later and not only could I hear it and see its strobe lights, it was much, much smaller is size. I have seen blimps to and it did not look like them.

From my vantage point, it did not appear quite as bright as seen in the videos on YouTube. As for size...at about a 75 degree angle in the sky, it is hard to say, but was substantial enough to be seen clearly. It was clear enough that I commented to my neighbor across the street as to what the heck it could be, and how did it get so close to the rocket when there is very definitely a \"no fly zone\" in place during launches. We are quite fortunate living near KSC, and can watch launches from our driveway...and while I don't have the close proximity as someone closer to the Cape, the lift-offs are very clear.

As I looked due South, at about 35 degrees above the horizon, I noticed a very odd light.  It didn't \"twinkle\"...it didn't \"pulse\"...it didn't \"flash\"...it wasn't a \"strobe\". It was more of an irregular \"flicker\", much like a fluorescent bulb when it is getting ready to burn out.  It was not regular in shape, but seemed to be extending out from a slightly brighter center point in a somewhat irregular form or pattern. Each illuminating flicker had a bit of a difference to the shape. And the color was odd, not a single shade but a blend of shades.  The size was larger than a medium-sized star, but that included the emitted light form.  It never went completely dark until the last quivery flicker.  About 2 or 3 seconds later it was in the SSE sky, at just slightly above the original degree point...seemed to be same size and description.  (Locations would have gone like this...Original sighting was as if I extended my arm straight out in front of me...Second appearance was as if I extended my arm mid-way between straight in front and straight to the side...hope this makes sense.)  It did its behavior for about another 10 seconds or so and was gone...nothing more.  I scanned the sky for the next 20 minutes while we walked, and it never appeared again.

I had been playing a ballgame with Barry F., Scott K., and Denny W.  It was lunch time and those three went to their respective houses to eat lunch.  I usually did not eat lunch so I waited in the open carport of Scott's house.  It was approximately noon, it has been a long time so I am estimating the approximately month, day, and year.  It was near the intersection of Showalter Court and Seabridge Drive in the Laurel Park Subdivision in Orlando, Florida.  Barry's house was on the southeast corner, Denny's house was on the northeast corner, and Scott's house was one house to the east of Barry's house.  I sat in the carport of Scott's house facing north.  I observed a white or silver in color craft which looked like a rocket sideways, a cylinder with a pointed top.  But the rocket looking craft was not flying upwards like a rocket launch, the craft was flying sideways in a counterclockwise motion from north to the west to the south very slowly.  The craft did not have wings.  I lived not too far from what is today the Orlando International Airport, but then it was not an International Airport.  And I had lived near McCoy Airforce Base before that house, so I had seen plenty of airplanes and jets.  When I saw the craft I immediately began yelling for the occupants inside Scott's house to come out.  I was even banging on the door. Finally, Scott's older sisters which were in high school came out.  But the craft had flown to the west out of sight.  I was very nervous trying to explain to them what I saw, but it was not there when they came out.  I then ran home as fast as I could.  I began explaining to my mom and grabbed her by the hand to come outside and look at the strange craft.  But two story apartments were built to the south of our home and the apartments blocked the view of the craft as it flew from the west to the south still in a circular counterclockwise motion.  I had not talked about the incident for almost 23 years when I had a great aunt on my maternal side come visit and have dinner.  During the night she mentioned about actual encounters with alien beings which included time loss, implantation of a device (which she states her doctor removed from her abdomen), and several follow up visits by aliens.  I had not said a thing to her when she confronted me about seeing an unidentified craft.  Her words I cannot recall totally were something to the effect of \"And you know because you have seen one haven't you?\"  I could only explain this confrontation as strange.  I never said a word to her about the incident.  I did not know a sight like this existed.  I am currently a field grade military officer in the Army Reserves.  I am also a sworn law enforcement officer working as a detective.  I cannot explain what I saw on that summer day, but it continues to be unexplained and unknown to me what the craft was that I observed.

There are two stars in the east-southeast sky, at about 45 degrees above the horizon, that I find myself always looking at, and happened to be checking them out, when I noticed a third \"star\" next to them, on the south side. Looking more closely, I saw that it wasn't round, but oval in shape...more like a longer oval, but not cigar-shaped. And the quality of the light from it was different, being more of a glow as opposed to reflected light or \"light bulb\" type light. It was very white, with a blue tinge. It also slightly pulsed.  And that \"star\" just stayed there, not moving...and NOT like the way the headlights of a plane can seem to not move when coming directly towards you...it simply DID NOT move.  After a couple of minutes, it began to move very slowly towards the southeast, in what appeared to be a straight path. Suddenly, as I watched it, it went from being at a 45 degree angle in the sky, to about a 55-60 degree angle...and when it did this, the position of the craft did not change...no pointing upward or aiming...it was just suddenly \"up\". From that angle, it continued southeast for a minute or so, then, as suddenly as it was \"up\", it was back down at the 45 degree level, moving at the same steady rate of speed. I watched it until it was out of sight.  During its movement, the pulsing and color tone never changed, nor did the flight angle of the craft. Its size was approximately that of a BB pellet held at arm's length, slightly larger than the two stars I regularly see at that point in the sky.  I will send you a sketch of this event later today.

At about 80 degrees up in the sky, I immediately noticed a \"star\", medium in size, glowing blue...a shade or 2 darker than a \"robin's egg\" hue. I use the term \"glowing\" because the quality of the light it gave off was not reflected, nor was it incandescent...it was not \"twinkly\". It was a glow. It stood out to me because of the quality of light and the unusual color. As I watched it, it moved slightly in a very minimal southerly direction. The it stopped, and after a couple of seconds it did something that truly took my breath. It dropped, straight down, in a dead fall, at quite a fast speed. Of course, it was so high up that it never did have a great deal of detail in its appearance, remaining a glowing blue medium star size object...but it dropped from about 80 degrees up, to approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. And then it stopped...sat seemingly motionless for a few seconds at that 30 degree level...then took off at an incredible speed, heading due north. The whole event lasted approximately 30 seconds or so.",

In fact, that was the only way to see them in that they blotted out the stars and the clouds above then. There were no lights at all. There was no sound at all. I have seen stealth aircraft several times (even at night) and they do not look perfectly triangular. These were, equal sides with no \"Flaps\" or appendages. They flew quickly accross the sky, zig-zagging and speeding up/slowing down in an unusual way. Then they sped off at a great rate of speed and were gone from sight. This was right over the intersection of I-4 and International Drive, in the toutist district. We thought that it was pretty bold of \"whosever\" they were to fly over the city. But, in truth, unless you were looking right at them you would not see them. Later, it appeared to us that some jets flew accross the sky in the same direction, perhaps in pursuit?

I was at a local gas station talking to some friends and saw what I first thought were two (2) planes on nearly converging vectors. #1 was coming from South to North & the other (#2) from West to East. There was likely less than 1,000 feet of distance between them at the nearest point. At the \"cross-over point\" the #1 craft (ufo?) was seen to only have RED lights...whereas the #2 craft was a normally appearing/sounding plane. At this point the plane veered swiftly left as if to \"chase\" the #1 object. The #1 (ufo?) proceeded into a left (West) turn and was closely followed by the #2 craft (plane). The plane was never able to \"catch\" the #1 object but seemed to stay in trail by perhaps a distance of 1,000 feet. They continued in a West-Northwest direction till out of sight. I observed the objects with a small pair of binoculars and could readily ID the #2 craft as a light plane, but could NOT do so with the #1 object. All I saw on the #1 craft was RED lights EXCEPT for one instant when I observed a WHITE light at the rear as it was moving West away from me.

All of a sudden, the girls started screaming and pointing at the sky.  Looking up, I observed a disk shaped UFO with two rows of blinking light panels located on the bottom and around the perimeter of the disk.  I distinctly remember that as an inner panel glowed an outer panel was illuminated and vice versa.  The panels turned on and off in a checkerboard pattern continuously and almost appeared flourescent.  I say \"almost\" because no \"bulb\" was observed, either directly or as if hidden behind an opaque or transparent cover--the entire panel glowed evenly with no observable concentration of light.  The craft traveled from south to north no more than 50-60 feet above our heads.  It moved very slowly, in complete silence, and then disappeared behind dense trees (what is now the area immediately south of North Lane in Pine Hills).  The Orlando International Airport was a SAC strategic bomber base at the time and, as an adult, I now believe that the craft was somehow connected with the base.  I have no evidence to back that supposition.  I find it interesting to note that a 1966 report and a 1976 report on this site also note glowing light panels.

I continued looking out the window wondering why these two helicopters were following. after about 10 minutes on a road called colonial the copters moved in closer to the road so i started slowing my car down to get a closer look at these helicopters, when it happened. A white-blue electrical pulsating on and off in no particular pattern flew directly over my car and towards the helicopter that was on my left hand side. The object then headed towards the helicopter, flew right up to it stopped still in the air, dropped straight down and then began flying along a treeline on the side of the road, at this point both helicopters then began following it. What is the craziest about this is that the object was so low to the ground only about 150 yards high when it passed over my vehicle, the only noise i heard was from the helicopters. The object would not have been visible if it didnt begin the pulsating. it was almost as if it was teasing the helicoptors. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous.  PD))",

      "story": "Brilliant white \"square\" stationary in the sky above west Orange County / Lake County Florida. On 15 August 2008, from approximately 6:25pm to 6:30pm, I observed an unusual object in the sky while I was driving home from work.  I had just merged onto SR429 from the Florida Turnpike, heading north toward Apopka, Florida.  The weather was partly cloudy, but it was not raining, and visibility was good.  Looking out my driver\u2019s side window (toward the west), something in the sky caught my attention. An incredibly bright, white object appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky at what I would estimate to be 700ft to 800ft in altitude.  My initial reaction was that the object was probably an airplane reflecting sunlight while banking, but after continuing to observe it, I quickly realized that was not the case. The object appeared to be perfectly square in shape, not a cube, but a flat, square shape.  It was smooth, with very clearly defined perimeter lines and corners, and was a very brilliant color of white;  incredibly bright, but in a different manner than the brightness of the sun (very comfortable to look at, no glare associated with it, and its brightness did not obscure its shape at all; there was no  \"halo\" or other glow surrounding it in spite of its brightness).  It seemed to be illuminated from inside of the object, even though the object was so flat that it appeared to be almost two dimensional.  The object was located well below the cloud cover, and stuck out like a sore thumb against the overcast, grey sky. I would estimate my distance from the object to be at least one mile.  I\u2019m not sure I can accurately estimate the size of the object, but my impression was that it was fairly large given that I could clearly see the outline of its shape at that distance.  The best description I can give regarding its size is that if you held your thumb up at arm\u2019s length, the object would appear to be slightly smaller than your thumbnail. The object was absolutely stationary in the sky; no movement whatsoever for the entire period that I observed it (at least 5 minutes).  While observing the object, I noticed a small, round flashing light that appeared to be further west of the object, but moving toward it.  When the flashing light had almost reached the bright, square object, they both disappeared.  I spent several minutes trying to spot them again, but they never reappeared.",

Looking up at the stars, as I usually do, I noticed one moving. It had a blue glow, and did not sparkle like stars usually do...it was definitely a glow. As I watched it, it was in the sky at about 80 degrees from the horizon, and was traveling from North to South. Its flight was more like a glide, very smooth. It was different from the way planes and jets move through the sky. And while \"glide\" seems to be a bit inadequate, I am not sure how else to describe its motion other than with that word. After a minute and a half or so, 2 other objects joined it in flight...they had the same blue glow. All continued to head South. From my vantage point, I could not really tell if they were in any kind of flight formation or not. One thing that struck me was the flight path. Usually when I notice planes going overhead, they tend to follow the curve of the Earth, getting closer to the horizon as they move further away. These 3 objects did not seem to do that. As they proceeded South, they did not get lower on the horizon, but continued into the darkness of the sky, like they were going away from Earth.

As we were heading back to the house from the end of our walk, I noticed that the object began to glow with very clear blue color, a couple of shades darker than robin's egg blue, the metallic quality no longer visible.  As it got brighter, it also began to slowly pulsate.  The pulsation grew faster, and the glow grew brighter. Suddenly, as it was about as bright as it seemed it could get, and pulsing as fast as a strobe, it took off in a N direction...in motion and out of sight in about 2! seconds.

Both were, to my ears, completely silent. The blue one blinked out and re-appeared slightly further east in the sky, and was at a complete stop...no motion that I could detect. The white one seemed to slow down and did a little zigzag in the sky, at what seemed to be the same altitude as the blue one. While the white one did its maneuvers, the blue one blinked out of view a couple more times, and after each would re-appear in a slightly different part of the sky, at a complete stop, but still within the area of the white one and its zigzag movement. After about a minute (60 seconds) of this, they both took off, the blue one slightly ahead of the white one, at what seemed to be the same altitude, in a due south direction. Needless to say, I was quite mesmerized by the performance I witnessed. I have provided contact information on the Report Form.",

Last saturday at about 8pm, I saw a black triangle go over my house, I could barely see it, but then it went between me and clouds, I could see it clearly for just a second or two.  It was a black triangle, it was approximately 4-7000ft, it made no sound and was moving faster than any commercial aircraft I had ever seen.  The whole sighting lasted about 7-10 seconds.  I shrugged it off thinking that it was a commercial aircraft because I live close to MCO airport and it caught me by suprise and I didnt get time to focus and think. Tonight at approximately 11:35, I was in the back yard, and I looked up and saw three lights in the shape of a triangle. Tonight, it looked as if it was three lights in the shape of a triangle, but I couldnt make out the shape like I could before.  There was a very very slight overcast, but it was definately there, I followed it from almost righ above me to about 22.5 degrees and it disappeared into thin air.  The sky was hazy, but I could still see the stars through it.  The lights made no sound, they moved very quickly, and just disappeared.  I thoufht that I was crazy the first time I saw it, or maybe because I saw it by suprise and didnt get enough time to actually focus on it and thought it was a plane.  Tonight I was able to fully watch it, and I know it wasn't a commercial aircraft. It disappeared right in front of my eyes.  It almost looked like three symetrical spotlights pointed at the sky then moved across and turned off.  I have never seen anything like this before.",

October 28, 2008  Last night at approximately 8:40 pm I was driving North on Dunhill Drive in Orlando preparing to make a Westerly left turn on to Jepson drive.  The sky was dark when suddenly I noticed what looked to me like a single bright round white light in the sky moving at a very high rate of speed, faster than anything I have ever seen, in a North West direction.  It was difficult to tell the altitude because it happened so quickly, but because I was able to tell it was a high rate of speed, I had the sense that it was between one thousand and two thousand feet.  My first thought was that it was the afterburner of a jet aircraft but I could not see any trail and the light was traveling parallel to the ground, not moving either up or down. Also seemed strange to see something like this in an area of relatively high commercial aircraft traffic to both OIA and Orlando Executive Airport. My location at the time was approximately eighteen miles NE of OIA, and approximately nine miles due East of OEA. ((initials deleted))  Orlando, FL",

Upon finishing my meal I was just looking up at the sky at the partial moon in the blue sky.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  When I saw a red dot.  As my eyes focused in, I noticed there was a mixture of dots.  Three appeared to be red, four white and one semi green. These dots seemed to be very high in the sky.  They moved around in different directions.  Passing between each other going in different directions and forming straight lines and triangles. Towards the end of the experience they all totally disappeared at the same time.  Then after some scouring of the sky 4 or 5 reappeared  northwest of the original location. There is no way this could have been balloons, satellites or planes. They held the same location besides moving around each other for more than 10 minutes. This is the first time we have ever seen anything like this.  Whatever we saw seemed to have control of some kind, to be moving backwards and forwards and up and down. There is no way this could be weather related. My Wife Googled to see how we could tell someone about experience, because we felt compelled to let someone, because it was really weird.   While Googling we stumbled on a site that had a video on April 8 in Arizona which looked very similar to what we saw.   But theirs was at night and ours was during the day.  And you could distinctively see the three different colors. White, Green and Red.   Even with the sun going down we have never seen anything that appeared to be that high with such color. Just thought you needed to know.  We are glad we found your site to report this.  We feel in our selves that we saw something very special tonight.  It is not B.s..",

The object was a dull silver, with light from the sun reflecting off of it. It was shaped like a compressed pill.  A cylinder with a dome on the top and bottom.  In the place where the dome forms from the straight side of the object, there was a line that goes straight across the object to the other side. This applied to the lower half of the object as well. After 45 sec or so of staring at the object, I decide to look away to see if it was an illusion in my eyes.  I look back less than 5 sec later, and the object is gone.

There was a large Orange fire ball over South Orlando that was not an airplane nor a helicopter and couldn't have been a flare because there was never a tail and it was traveling from East to West without falling for quite some distance.  At one point there were very large sparks coming off one side that appeared to go up and out in an arc for the most part.  Many of us were on the porch of a restaurant in Celebration FL and we all witnessed it.  It didn't act or appear as falling space debris would either.   After traveling for a couple of miles straight from East to West is when it appeared to stop in mid air and the sparks came out.  It sat there for some time after that before it finally just disappeared in that same spot...without falling.  It also changed color to a greenish then white color then back to the orange glow.  It was too far from us to tell if there was sound or what shape it may have been.  There were other aircraft in the vicinity and this loo! ked completely different than those.   What was that?",

The small lights were below the object \"pearled together\" at an angular slope of about 45 degrees.  Once they blinked in, they began rapidly pulsating, one after the other, consecutively.  Then, the big ball began shrinking slowly, and while it shrank, the little lights blinked out a few seconds later, again, consecutively.  Then, the big ball faded out of sight, as well, right on the spot where it had been.  Because the object was not moving, and hovering low, at t! he time it faded out, we thought it had cloaked itself.  After that I made a report to MUFON.   I am now reporting it here, as well.

Two lights were yellow, the other was red, and the light in the middle was rapidly pulsing.  At first I thought it was a plane, but then I noticed that it was not moving constantly like a plane does at night.  It was just there hovering in the sky. I looked closer to see if it was a tower with lights on it like an antannae but there was no tower attatched to the object.  At that point I was pretty certain it was a UFO.  I dashed back into my house, grabbed my camera, ran to a nearby neighborhood to get a better view, and began to film the object as it hovered there in the sky for about another 5-10 minutes.   After a while I noticed that the object was emanating a sound from it that sounded a lot like helicopter blades.  So I paused filming and began to look at the footage to see if was a helicopter.!   But when I looked back into the sky, the three lights had now transformed into an object with just one bright light, it flew higher into the sky, and then began to fly off. I filmed again for a few minutes as the object flew off.  There was no doubt in my mind at that point that what I saw was a UFO.",

This object looked like it could have been as far away as downtown (7 miles).  It was definitely below the cloud ceiling, maybe 10,000 ft, best guess.  So I wasn't really that close to it. When I first saw this oval, amber light, I thought it could be a meteorite, but what it did next nullified that explanation. It was moving from south to north, left to right from my vantage, and it was moving up and down as well, much like a sine wave. The size was almost as large as a full moon. And the light was bright, but not shining.  It was just a steady orange glow. It didn't move unusually slow or fast, maybe a little faster than the speed of an aircraft. Then, it either shot due west, away from me really fast, or it slowly dimmed to a small point of light.  I believe it moved away, because it seemed to get lower in the sky.  The light disappeared, and a few seconds later reappeared as a dim light.  It did that twice, and that was the last I saw of it.",

A separate, similar sized light was leading the triangle at an unknown distance.  Shortly after the triangle passed overhead, a 5 and 6thth amber light came into view following the triangle.  In total, there were 6 lights.  The height and distance between the individual orbs was difficult to estimate because I have never seen anything that moved like them.  They moved in sync and had none of the characteristics of traditional, well known aircraft.  I have always been a UFO skeptic but this changed my perception.

      "story": "Three small white orbs flying erratically extremely high in a perfectly blue sky during broad daylight. I was laying down on the back of my truck, looking at the clouds.  It was a beautiful day, the sky was bright blue. I was watching birds flying by and then I began looking at the vast blue of the sky.  As my eyes adjusted to changing depths, an object caught my eye. It was a very small white orb. It appeared to be either emitting its own light, or reflecting the Sun's.  This is because it kept a constant color. At first I thought it might be a star or planet, since I'm quite unexperienced with object of the sky. However, the longer I watched it, the more I realized how high in the sky it actually was.  This was in contrast to passing planes, which looked very small from my perspective, and were still obviously lower than the object.  I know this because at one point, the object moved behind some clouds that were passing by.  At this point I really noticed how erratic its movement was; it slowed down and sped up; it was also moving in different directions. As I was! watching this first object, I saw another one very close to it.  This one was moving much faster in the same direction as the first one, and there was yet another one following that one at the same speed.  It appeared as if the third one was chasing the second one, as they were moving erratically. After around 8 minutes, they were all completely covered by a passing cloud, and by the time it passed and I could see the blue background again-  I had lost all sight of the orbs. Keep in mind all of this was occurring at a very high altitude and in a very small zone of the sky, as the objects looked extremely small from ground level. Although the objects were moving extremely fast (much faster than any airplane that was passing by AND they were farther up), they were not making a scene. I myself have near perfect vision and unless I was concentrating perfectly on the level of altitude they were in, they would blur away and disappear. It happened a few times if I looked in another direction, finding them again was a matter of focusing on very small spots on the sky and looking for motion in the peripherals. This leads me to believe that UFOs are more common than we think during the day, yet they are so difficult to spot. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

She was outside for about 3 mins and then she brought something to my attention.  She has a puzzled confused look on her face as she pointed up into the night sky and questioned what are those orange reddish glowing balls.  I then took a good look and came to a conclusion that they weren\u2019t several things.  Such as candles, air planes, dragon fly\u2019s.  I knew that they were something odd.  I had already had my camera with me at the time and I soon then called my parents out to determine what they were.  My dad gazed up into the sky to further examine what they were.  At the time all of this was taking place there was a sudden stop of air traffic.  I live right by an air port so planes are coming in and out at all hours.  I notice that there were only two dots side by side heading towards the clouds going east to west.  During this time I soon began to capture everything on camera because I knew you would ha! ve to see it to believe it.  And then a swarm of 5 or 6 followed it in the same path after it disappeared.  After that 1 more came right along in the same direction I closely examined it through my camera lens and I noticed that the orange light started to dim and right in the center was a orange reddish dot.  I took a closer look of the whole thing and I saw a clear  3D outline of what looked like the whole thing.  The best way I am can describe them is floating orange jelly fish.

I wanted my father to see it so we went on again and I looked in the direction again and it was gone and there was a big thing of smoke that looked like a space shuttle took off in place of it. It couln't be fireworks because the lights were moving to the right they werent going up. They also lasted like 7 seconds and fireworks last for about 3 seconds. They were not flashing and were very close. Airplanes can't do that. Also airplanes don't dissapear or travel the whole horizon in 5 minutes.

      "story": "Reddish orange glowing orbs flying in formation  in Orlando at about 9:30 PM April 29, 2012 At about 9:30 pm, My family and I were on our way home after dinner at Tibby's in Winter Park. \u00a0We had gone to Winter Park to shop at the Whole Foods supermarket there. Right after passing the intersection of Lake Underhill and Econlockhatchee Road, travelling South on Econlockhatchee Rd., heading to home in Orlando, Florida , we saw a car in front of us pulled ooff the road on the right with its lights still on, door open and 2 young men outside the car. I was looking to see what they had pulled off for, and as we passed I saw that one person had either a camera or phone pointed up at about a 45-50 degree angle in front of him. It was odd because it was dark and all that was in front of him at that angle would be either a fence, a house's rooftop or the sky. So I was \"rubbernecking\", then some\u00a0lights caught my attention in the dark sky, in the direction where he was pointing his camera/phone at (West of us). I saw a line of a number of glowing reddish orange glowing orbs, lighter and bright at the center, lined up in an arc formation moving from left to right and up, in the sky. I shouted out to my family to look, look, look, a line of strange reddish lights. I realized why the people had pulled off and what they must have been taking pictures of. My husband who was driving, also saw the lights I was shouting about and pulled off the road too. We were now ahead of the other car, with their headlights facing us. My husband and I got out of the car and watched, calling our daughter to come look. She did, but seemed scared and hesitant. None of us recognized what they could be, orb shaped, with that reddish orange glow, brighter and lighter in the center. It was obvious to us that they were not planes from how they looked, moved, lined up and disappeared. There was also a plane flying in the opposite direction toward them off to the right, likely intending to land at the airport in that general area.. They were moving up and rig! ht and were disappearing one by one as they moved to the far r! ight. Th e largest was about the size of a pea the distance. My daughter couldnt get her iphone camera to work properly as she frantically tried to get a shot, she says it froze but managed to get a picture, though thee photo looks very red in color.\u00a0  The lowest one was largest and as they moved up to the right they were either smaller or farther, then disappeared one at a time. There were about 3 lower down and 2 up to the right. I don ' t know if there were more or not before we saw them since they were fisappearing. The people in the orher car had left. I only indicated 3 who saw this, counting only my family though I know at least 2 other strangers saw it as well. I wondered if the people in the plane did also. Eventually all disappeared. We went home, somewhat in shock and a little scared. I figure I would be the last person at this site reporting this but it just happened and we all saw it, though I am still having trouble processing what we saw, and wondering what people will think when or if I tell them.",

Therefore, I was watching the sky up, but facing North-Northeast (Ursa Major) direction to be more precise.\u00a0   That's when I noticed a single flying object crossing the sky in the same direction (Ursa Major) and disappearing behind the club house.  Time was between 5:30-5:45pm EST.   Sighting took about 3 seconds, it almost looked like a shooting star (but a bit slower) and the most intriguing part was its shape and rate of speed. It looked like an F-22, but more star shaped (7 points), grayish/light blue almost blending with the sky color, traveling between 20,000-30,000ft altitude, extremely fast I would estimate over 3,000mph given its height and the sighting duration but no sound, no trail, nor lights.  Measured 2/16 inches (squared). And given my background in the space program I can certainly say I have never seeing something like that before.

While watching it seemed to just float,slowly headed northeast,it changed shape an very couple seconds reflected a huge Sun Glare.  I got one shot at 200mm of a flare then it disappeared! The jet was closer by couple miles (shot with same 500mm an cropped same as the enlarged shots) so i est. the size the UFO to be at least the size of a passenger plane jet engine. Wasn't a Plane,not Venus,Not a Satellite, I'm left with weather balloon or theme park balloon  or parachute tour wind checker (but it was in air traffic lanes) or UFO. this is the second one of this shape an type i caught, First was 1-8-12. I have all the original shots but there huge an hard to upload.What do you think ! it is?",

I reached for my phone in my pocket to get ready to film and I observed a tracer or tail emit from the object about 15 feet out same color. It went another 20ft in that shape and imploded emitting 2 or 3 small balls from it almost like a roman candle and then just disappeared. Almost as if it exploded or hit something. It never changed it's flight pattern or height so it's hard for me to believe it was a shooting star. Specifically because of its size and color.

It was completely silent which is not conducive to low flying aircraft or helicopters here in Orlando being somewhat near the airports.  This ball had a burning glow effect and it was traveling medium slow.   As a star gazer for years growing up in a very rural area and now after living in Orlando for 5 years, I've never seen anything like it.  I almost wonder if it was some sort of a meteorite.   The night sky was very cloudy and the globe, or rather fireball, was very visible as it was flying beneath the clouds. It also did not blink, twinkle, or make any erratic movements.  I thought I saw a smoke like trail behind it, but I couldn't see that part of it as well, so I'm not certain.",

It was traveling in what appeared to be a southerly direction along the coastal region. Thinking that I should get some kind of point of reference regarding size and such,  I held out my hand at arm's length. The UFO was gliding along very slowly, in a straight path, taking about 2 minutes to travel what measured at arm's length to be between 10 and 12 inches.  The size of the craft, using my thumbnail at arm's length, was about 1/2 an inch. And it was a medium to medium dark RASPBERRY RED...not the tone of red like on emergency vehicle lights, or on traditional aviation lights...and it pulsated slowly. The lighting of the craft seemed to come from within the object, and not from an external! light source.  It continued along its flight path at what appeared to be the same altitude and direction for the entire 2 minutes that I was able to see it.  When it was no longer visible, I came inside, marked this event on my calendar, told my husband that I just saw a UFO and that I had to report it to NUFORC.

First thoughts: I looked for the tell-tale signs of airplane lights, but there were no wing lights, gear lights or any typical airplane lights whatsoever.  Being a trained pilot, I knew this was not a blimp or airplane.  I knew within seconds that this was something different, and ran outside my patio to take some pictures. Description:  The UFO was a spherical/elliptal shape of flashing pulsating reddish/raspberry light.  There was no pattern to the flashing, and seemed random.  It was moving slowly from East to West, perhaps SE to NW, or thereabouts.   An airliner passed above it, coming from MCO... typically airliners at this point are probably 8000-10000 feet up, and seemed to cross its path, so it was lower than that, and would estimate it was around 3000-5000'. Feelings:  Excitement.  I have only seen 1 other UFO several years ago, and was excited to see another one.  I immediately ran outside my screen to take some zoomed in pictures on my cellphone before it disappeared\u2026  I was able to get 3 in, as it traveled to the W/NW.

As I was looking up into the sky, which I regularly do when dog-walking, I noticed a &quot;star&quot; that was as bright as Venus, but in a different location. Venus, at that time of night, is almost directly due East. This \"light\" was on a south-southwest path in the sky...looking up, it was also about 70-75 degrees above the horizon. At first I thought it was coming towards me, and that the \"big light\" was the headlights of a jet.  Then I realized that it was going AWAY from me, and that the quality of the light coming from it was different to that of a jet headlight...more like it was lit from within.  With this understanding, the dog and I stopped in our front yard...I watched. As I looked on, the \"light object\" dimmed a bit, then, SPLIT INTO 3 separate smaller objects. Each one, though not as bright as the original, was also a \"ball of light.\" As soon as they were clearly separated from one another, they took off in 3 different directions...1 took a more southerly route, 1 went straight forward for a second then shot straight UP, and the third one banked sharply to the right (my right) and headed on a north-northwest trajectory.  The time that elapsed between separation and all 3 being no longer visible was about 15-20 seconds.

I live in Eastern Orange County, Fl, approx 12 miles east of the Orlando Intl Airport (OIA) in a rural type area.  The objects appeared in a somewhat vertical line but were staggered behind each other at different altitudes and fairly low on the horizon.  It appeared as if the objects were floating or traveling slowly to the north.  These objects appeared to be lower than the air traffic in the area that was departing from OIA.   The air traffic appeared to be initially departing to the south and then turning crosswind to the east and then turning toward a north departure from the Orlando area.  It was very apparent that the orange glowing objects were not aircraft.  I watched the objects for approx 1 min and the ran into the house to get my wife and son.  Upon returning to the front yard, we saw 3 remaining orange glowing objects in the sky.  Apparently the other! 2 or 3 objects had disappeared.  Two of the three remaining glowing objects faded quickly while heading in a easterly direction.  The last object continued to glow but slowly faded as it traveled in an easterly direction and it appeared to gain altitude until it was out of sight.",

      "story": "Orange sphere's in sky over Orlando, Florida that seemed interested in the planes nearby On May 26, 2013 at approximately 20:55 I had just arrived at my parents\u2019 home in southeast Orange County, Florida.   As I was walking to the front door I looked to the North and saw orange lights in the sky.  It had been dark only for a little while but the lights were easily distinguishable and I knew that what I was seeing was out of the ordinary.  At first there were only four of them each following the same path as the one in front of it?   I immediately opened my front door and yelled for my mother to come out to see what was going on knowing that this was something never seen before.  I asked her to grab her phone so I could record what I was seeing.  My parents have lived in this home for something like 40 years and I grew up there.  They\u2019re home is near the McCoy International Airport so there are planes coming and going in the eastern sky (literally) at all times.  I know what a plane looks and sounds like and these orange lights were moving much faster than ! any plane I have ever seen.  The orange light did not appear to be a beacon on the aircraft but it seemed to be the aircraft.  At one point one of the orange lights moved toward a plane traveling west from McCoy and came right up next to it, to what looked like a stone\u2019s throw from it.  I don\u2019t believe that any passenger plane would allow another plane to come that close or even a military plane over a civilian population.   As I was recording the strange lights they started to change direction from the north to south path to a direction due west and then one of them just disappeared, shortly after this another disappeared and then another until there was only one left.  The last orange light just kept heading west until I could not see it any longer and just as I stopped the recording another orange light appeared from the same spot as the other four.  It followed the same path as the previous four heading south until almost over top of me and then turning west until I could not see it any longer. I am not a UFO enthusiast, I don\u2019t watch the skies for anomalies, and I have never seen anything like this before.  I was totally surprised at what I was seeing but I can tell you this, I knew right away that what I was seeing was something that had never occurred here before.  My words and even the video I took do not do justice for what I saw, it was quite amazing.",

At approx 0300 hrs on the morning of May 28, 2013, while at work, I received a phone call from a co-worker (we both work at a local theme park) urging me and my other co-worker to meet them at their location as he was witnessing a flashing light in the sky.   We packed up our tools and hurried over to their location.when we arrived there,both the co-worker who had called me and his co-worker were both staring straight up at the sky.  I then, along with my co-worker, looked up in the same area of the sky and witnessed a flashing light that appeared to be clouded in mist.   There were no clouds in the sky and we could see the moon and the stars.  The object appeared to be about the size of the moon at times, had an amber color to the flash and at times appeared to have a blue color as well.  The flash continued for approximately 45 mins getting progressively faint until it was no longer visible. I must note that there are large search lights stationed at the entrance to the theme park which remain on all night.At 1st we thought that perhaps the lights were illuminating something in the sky as they scanned that region (where the lights seemed to converge) but then we noticed that the flashing did not really follow the same timing as the search lights. At times the object appeared to be football shaped. It also appeared to me as if it were a beacon flashing in mist. Being that this object was directly above us,we ruled out any radio antennas. There was no other clearly definable shapes over head such as a blimp or helicopter.The object did not make any sound.We also pointed a laser pen at it's location.When we did this it appeared to move as the flash would emanate from a different location thatn before. In total there were 4 witnesses to this event. I did call a friend of mine who was in another location of the theme park and asked her to go outside and see if she could see it.She said that she only saw the flash once.",

I was walking my dogs just before dawn this morning, 05/06/2013 at 5:30 a.m. when I looked up at the starless, gray sky and crescent moon.  I noticed movement from the east; a pin point of light moving quickly across the sky that I believed was a satellite until I noticed it was trailed by three more pin points of light in a perfect V formation that never wavered, changed distance, sped up, or slowed down.   We had cloud cover this morning, so I lost them after about 10 seconds when they flew over the clouds in the western sky (judging the cloud height is how I perceived initially that they were as high as a satellite, along with the speed and consistency). I had the impression of a formation of crafts as opposed to it being one craft or even two with one being the small lead craft and the second consisting of a triangle shaped craft.  If either of these were the case, it would have been enormous in scale.  If they were single crafts, the distance between them would have been vast \u2013 enough to see inconsistencies in either speed or distance between the crafts.  I have just never seen anything like it. The distance between the \u201clead\u201d light and the \u201ctop\u201d of the triangle was exactly (or appeared to me to be) the same distance from the \u201ctop\u201d of the triangle to the bottom left and bottom right corners, as illustrated.  \t\t. \t.\t \t\t.

I heard what I thought was a whirring sound of a helicopter and saw lights and assumed it was a helicopter landing at the nearby hospital.  It began to fly directly over me and hovered, when I looked up, I realized (gulp) that it looked nothing like a helicopter and looked like a small version of a  stealth jet, which of course cannot hover.  It had very bright lights emanating from it all around the sides and at least one shining down from the bottom of the craft.  I looked over to my dog and she was looking up at it and was mesmerized, but not barking, which she would normally do at loud big things.   I looked back up at the object, which was about 40 to 50 feet above us, and it suddenly moved sideways for about 200 feet, then went up into space at an incredible speed that within 30 seconds, it was up so high it looked like a star.  I had never seen anything move that fast ever.  My father was an air force pilot, so I am familiar with planes and jets.

Over the last month or so, I have contacted Patrick Air Force Base...NASA...a tech person who works for a local gas company...the 2 local airports...NONE of these folks had an explanation for the sound.  However, the NASA person said that I was the 3rd or 4th person to call NASA about a \"loud, deep humming sound and some weird explosions\".

So, far, other than finding stories of folks in other areas who have heard similar mysterious sounds, nothing yet...

      "story": "single and silent yellowish light, traveling southwest to northeast below cloud cover, seen in northwest Orlando, Florida At approximate 20:05 on December 10, 2013, just as I exited my work place, I looked up at the sky, generally towards the northeast and probably at an angle of about 70 degrees above the horizon, and saw a yellowish light, smaller than the current apparent size of Jupiter but bigger than most star, traveling at a steady speed, somewhat like a typical satellite but a bit faster, heading from the southwest towards the northeast below what appeared to be a relatively-low cloud overcast. I immediately attempted to confirm that it was an airplane, but no other lights or a structure was visible.  And if I recall correctly, the light did not appear to have the typical brilliance of aircraft lights, nor did it appear to be a craft just within the cloud layer, with its main light source diffused, and perhaps the other lights obscured, by the clouds, thereby giving it the appearance of a single light object; it did appeared as one object, i.e., an object of light, and I am quite certain it was below the clouds and not passing through, or thinly veiled by, them; so it was probably not the International Space Station.  It may have been a plane, but it seemed too close, below an overcast that was reflecting some of the ground-based lighting, for it not to have been discernible.  I did not perceive any sound emanating from it, either; from the beginning of the observation, I felt uneasy as I intently watched this light/object and sensed I was possibly witnessing somet! hing not man-made.  The quality of the round or oval light brought to mind the descriptions of plasma radiating UFOs.  I kept a constant watch to note if it stopped and/or changed directions, or perhaps pulsed, but it simply continued on its steady pace, becoming dimmer as it became more distant until it finally disappeared below the tree line to the northeast.  The observation probably lasted less than a minute. I estimate the line of travel to have been a line passing through the Tampa Bay area, across the northern Orlando area, which is where I was, and on out to the Atlantic Ocean somewhere between the Kennedy Space Center and Daytona Beach.  Was it generally following the Interstate 4 corridor?",

It was last Saturday, 10/19/2013 at approximately 8:45 PM, I was leaving my mom's home in north east Orlando area (College Park).  I was facing her reminding her to lock up when I turned to walk down the driveway to my car, I saw 2 boxes of orange/reddish light looking like fire coming toward me.  They were coming from the north east sky between the two homes across the street.  They appeared to be almost floating toward me with no sound, and no movement other than straight forward movement when the first object began heading south west and the second object appeared to reach the same point and follow it.    I was telling my mom what I saw, and when I turned to point out where I saw them first, there appeared another orange box coming from the same area with another seen following it.   They both changed direction at the same place the first two did and moved south west.  I watched them until they got smaller and smaller and when I turned back to where they had come from, there was another headed toward me, with one behind it.  Again they moved to approximately the same area and turned toward the south west.   I got into my car and moved to the end of the road and watched 2 more boxes of fire looking light moving across the sky towards the south west following the others.  I saw, in approximately 10-15 minutes of time, 4 groups of orange/red boxes in sets of 2... all originating from the same area and moving off to the south west toward the city of Orlando. To my naked eye, they appeared to be boxes of fire, they did not glow, but seemed to radiate color, almost iridescent looking.  My first thought when I saw them was perhaps hot air balloons, but it was night, I saw nothing above the boxes, and they made no sound.  I then thought perhaps paper lanterns, but they each followed the first one, and appeared to move in the same pattern.  They also were in groups of two.   As I saw the first one come toward me, I could see another smaller following it, and when the first one headed in the south west direction, the following one was still coming forward and getting bigger until it headed south west and followed the first.  Then about 2-3 minutes later another group of 2 was seen.  Prior to this sighting at approx 7:30 PM, I had heard several deep booms like fireworks being set off somewhere.  I went out at that time and saw nothing, it was partially cloudy that night and I figured the cloud cover had accentuated the fireworks from the Disney area and that was what I heard.   I am not sure that this had anything to do with this sighting or not, but thought it should be mentioned.",

They started appearing one at a time and took a kind of formation as they rose into the sky, first there were three in a triangle formation a space then four in a rectangle formation, they three more until twenty three appeared and moved gently across the sky and disappeared into the night sky.  They moved at the same rate of speed and in the same direction, while they disappeared at varying spots across the sky.   During this time I noted we could see the stars clearly in the sky, an airplane traveling from the South East to North West through and passed the red lights.  The interesting part was the red lights never blinked like the lights on the airplane and we noted that while the airplane was moving away from us we could still see it in the distance while the red lights completely disappeared at various points of the sky.  I did try to take a picture of the lights \u2013 un! successfully \u2013 the lights did not show up on my I-phone and subsequently did not show up on the pictures I took.  I suspect the lights were too small and too far away.  I am not sure if this is an actual UFO siting but thought it to be rather interesting and unusual experience for me and my friend.   There were two other people watching as the red lights cross the sky and multiple walkers in the park noticing the lights as we watched.

Instead, it stopped behind a building in the distance and climbed in a completely vertical approximately 200-300 feet, then it stopped and made and IMMEDIATE right turn to the North/Northwest. In my experience, there is no fixed wing or rotorcraft that can possibly move at the speeds this object moved or execute the maneuvers of this object.

It looked like a UFO craft,  So I started waving and it just continue to go down like if it was landing on earth.",

They were traveling from west of West North West to East east south east. The lights traveled from horizon to horizon in approximately 15 seconds. The formation of lights was 1 followed by 2 offset from each other and then another 2 parallel to each other. They flew above an airliner so I know that they were at a very very high altitude and were not Satellites. They maintained their trajectory and heading. for the altitude that they were at they were travelling excessively fast.  Does anyone know if we bombed someone in the Central African region?  They appeared to be something like final stage rocket reentry vehicles of some sort.  There were no sounds or vibrations associated with the over-flight.  And, no vapor trails associated with them.  So, they were either traveling in near earth or upper ionosphere.  There was also no change in appearance or fading of their glow and maintained relative distance from one another. Neither they nor the aircraft that they passed over seemed to pay any attention to the other or deviate from their course for fear of collision. normally, if I see satellites they are singular but also behave in the same way.  But the glow was more like a planet then a satellite. Possibly like a Mars type appearance but traveling.",

It was practically invisible.  The night before at dusk I saw a yellowish, orangish round object flying parallel and just above the tops of the trees at high speeds, heading south.   Last month at 7:30 pm my daughter and I saw a very bright, white object hovering for 4 seconds and then flew away at very high speeds without a sound.  One week prior at 7:30 pm I saw a white, bright object in the sky moving very slow, then it turned red, then a flash of light and a illuminated cloud or smoke appeared in front of it and it disappeared.  Six years ago I went outside my house at 7:00 am and saw in the eastern sky 3 black bowling shapes in a triangle pattern hovering for about 10 seconds then flew away heading south at very high speeds without sound.

I was walking my dog on a plot near my house.  I live a few miles from Orlando International Airport, hence I see a lot of planes taking- off, landing and taxiing mainly.   A ball of light was sighted flying at a considerably lower altitude (above me) and had no aerial taxiway lights (since it was at altitude for landing).  At the same time I called my sister and asked her to leave the house to see also..  At that time I was running back home with my dog along to see my sister, since I needed another witness (was not the first ball of light that I see here in Orlando-Fl.)   Are looking at the ball together and the ball of light was flying at a constant speed and then the more strange happens, it begins to rise slowly..  We were able to see the ball of light getting farther up the point we saw the light gradually decrease until disappearing in the sky (remember that was not a cloud in the sky)   at the end of it, I was super excited to have been able to show someone more, and happier still to have been my sister (she's 21 )  I'm lover of planes, helicopters, RC\u2019s planes/Helicopters and virtually everything that flies from when I was a child, so I know exactly what I saw was not any type of aircraft.

A deep, droning sound...more than just a HUM...and with a \u201cmechanical\u201d quality to it. I listened to it for a couple minutes, then got up to go to the bathroom...giggled to myself, thinking I was just hearing my bladder rumble. No, that wasn't it... I could hear it in the bathroom... And all throughout the house !!  After leaving the loo, I went into every room, and looked out the windows, and UP. But the sky was very overcast, and I couldn't see anything. As much as I wanted to go outside and look, there was \u201csomething\u201d that told me not to do so...this morning was not a cool time to do so...and I have to admit, the sound was a bit eerie. The most intense aspect of it was NOT just the noise itself...but HOW it seemed to be... The best way I can described it would be that it seemed to \u201cencapsulate\u201d our house...as if a bowl had been put over us, upside down. And yes, to me, this noise was LOUD...quite a bit louder than the HUM I regularly hear when I really listen. So I went back to bed, and lay still and listened. All the while this was happening, the cats were glued to me. Not freaking out and running around the house, but trying to stay as close to me as they could. And when I came back to bed, and lay on my right side, 3 of them lay on the top of my left side...3 more lay right next to me as close as they could get...and several more were on the dressers  After about 45 minutes more, it stopped...as if someone had flipped a switch. It didn't \u201cfade away\u201d...it was just suddenly GONE. The silence was very intense...made the hairs on my arms and neck stand on end... Several of the cats came slowly over to the bedroom window to look out...and yes, they looked UP. And for the life of me, I could NOT get back to sleep. My husband, ((name deleted)), woke up to go to the bathroom around 8AM, and I asked him if he had any weird dreams or such...he said NO, but felt that the house was creepily quiet. And no, I did NOT wake him up during the NOISE... I had wanted to, but couldn't figure out HOW to do so without planting the suggestion of \u201chearing something weird\u201d in his head...THAT would have affected his experience. So now I must investigate this, to see if anyone has reported such an experience to MUFON and NUFORC. Everything I learn, I will write down, for my own records. ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone in the Orlando area was witness to the sound, we would like to invite them to submit a written report, to supplement the report above.  PD))",

It traveled at a high rate of speed (from just above \"horizon\" to past and beyond the buildings to south in 15 or so seconds).  It could have been traveling up and then went south or might have been further away and seem to be rising first.  I estimate that is 3.5 miles in 15 seconds or 840mph.   It also preceded a southward moving storm and traveling in the center of the airport landing flight paths. The object had no details or irregularities--just a plain sphere.  I thought it might be the bulb of a helicopter at first, but it flew directly above me in clear sky and had no tail or rotor.  It started white (almost bright as it seemed to be ascending) and turned grey as it passed overhead, like moving to the shadow side of a sphere but the sun was west and low at 6:30pm. I didn't have my camera ready (doh!) and my wife dismissed it as a helicopter at range and then walked away. Ultimately it is only my witness testimony\u2026",

I stared at it, then seen a pin point of white light at about the 7 o'clock position from the larger object as I watched it it appeared another pinpoint of white light came near the other smaller light and then blinked out.   While watching these objects I looked to the lower right of the larger object at about the 4 O'clock position and noted another pin point of light.  At this point I was observing one larger object and the 2 pinpoints of light.  Occasionally the 4th would blink on by the one at the 7 O'clock position. I started to doubt what I was seeing thinking perhaps I was just looking a some debris's on the screening.  I got out of the pool and walked outside of the screen room and the objects were still there.  I went back into my seating spot in the pool and continued to watch for close to 25 minutes.   All of a sudden they all vanished in the blink of an eye.  I sat there for a while still looking up at the sky and then saw what I assumed to be the larger object higher in the sky but did not see the smaller objects. I will try an give some idea as to where the objects were using a structural beam of my screen room.  The beam is parallel to my patio approximately 10 feet off the deck.  I was sitting in my pool on a seat approximately 18 inches below the deck.  The large object appeared about 12 to 14 inches above this beam and appeared to be 3/8 of an inch long.   The object at the 7 o'clock position appeared to be about 3 inches below the larger object. The object at the 4 o'clock position was about 6 to 7 inches from the larger object.   I have watched shuttle and rocket launches at the cape from my backyard and the larger object seemed to be in that proximity.

In front of me to the North above FL-528 (Beachline).  It was moving to slow and low to be a meteor. Estimated size approximately 15-20 ft. In diameter.   Behind the object there seemed to be a disturbance in the atmosphere maybe 30 ft. long, and appeared to have a heat shimmer effect.  I don't believe it was ball lighting because there were no storms in the area and even humidity was relatively low for Orlando, this time of year. An interesting couple of notes to this sighting. This 'ball of plasma?' appeared at the exact moment in which I thought of a UFO sighting witnessed by a friend of mine that occurred in a neighborhood less than 2 miles from this one.

So, I grabbed my dog and proceeded out the front door of my house, and no sooner did step out and looked up at the night sky that had some slight overcast, did I notice to the south/east sky some sort of slow descending craft with four extremely bright round white lights.  It momentarily stopped and all of a sudden the four white lights began to randomly blink. Needless to say, at that point, I'm starting to freak out, looking for anyone that I could find to witness what was going on, while still keeping my eyes on the craft.   Then all of a sudden the craft while stationary makes a quarter turn to the right clockwise and there were four more lights the same size but these were all red in color emanating the same brightness, and they began a random blinking as well. From my left peripheral view I caught sight a commercial air liner descending and approaching in on its flight path for a landing into Orlando International Airport (MCO) which is approximately four miles south from this location.  That was when the craft started descending straight down at this time and it felt as if it was avoiding the airliners pathway. It slowly descended out of my view behind some tree tops and houses and I would guess about maybe three to five blocks away at most.  That was when I made a dash into the house for my point & shoot digital camera, phone and car keys and decided to search out what exactly this craft was.  My first thought was, it was some sort of expensive really big hovering drone and surely I would be able to track who ever was flying it while they were packing it away, but I found nothing so I extended my search even further out than I anticipated and still nothing.  I drove back to the main road SR 436 hoping to catch some people perhaps gathered talking about the lights but there also I found no one... Approach and descent of craft:  From the S/E sky, heading S/W.   Speed:  Slow.   Approximate size:  Ten feet plus in diameter.   Shape:  disk like.   Lights:  Four per quarter side (but could only see two sides of craft)  Color of craft:  N/A  Sound or Humming:  None (and it was a really quiet night)  Height in the sky of craft:  Just below the over cast at the time of descent. Side notes:  There was also a smaller solid blue light off to the bottom side of the craft. ((name deleted)) Orlando, FL.",

I was walking a dog in a neighborhood in Central Florida around 8:20pm.  I looked up and saw a light in the sky.  I almost dismissed it as an airplane, but looked again and realized there were several lights all very near to each other.  When I later counted there were nine in the photos and video.  The lights were reddish/orange and did not change.  There was no noise that would usually be associated with aircraft and they were moving very slowly.  They were only visible for a couple minutes before disappearing behind clouds.  I did not see them reappear after that. I was able to get two photos and a short video of the lights. Having spent several years in the USAF, I have personally witnessed aircraft that is capable of hovering and flying at very slow speeds, but I\u2019ve never seen this many flying so close together in this kind of formation.  I am aware of a government facility of some kind nearby that is not on maps.  My husband and I made a wrong turn shortly after moving to the area and came upon a guarded gate.  We were told to turn around immediately or risk arrest, but when I looked on the map on my phone, the facility was not there. I\u2019m not sure if these lights could somehow be connected to the government facility we stumbled across, but these certainly did not appear to be normal airplanes.",

Drove the truck back up to the other end of property.  After I got out I noticed a bright light.  Didn't think anything of it at first as I am only about 3 miles north of the international airport.  I stood and watched a moment.  I immediately noticed that it was barely moving---  way slower than a jetliner would be going......  it also appeared very bright and large as well.   I had binoculars just inside the door of my shop.  I grabbed them and watched the object.  (7x50)    It showed to be perfectly spherical and a bright white light evenly distributed over the surface.  The light was a pure white-- not the red-orange that is reflected off satellites just after dark.  It seemed to be moving very slowly across the sky.  Jupiter (or Saturn) was just setting in the western sky--- and the object was was about 1 to 2 times the diameter of the planet.   The objects speed seemed to vary from very slow to all most stopped. Judging by the very slow speed --- a satellite at that slow speed would have to be several thousand miles out to go that slowly----  and to have THAT angular diameter at that distance---  it would have had to be many miles across. However I don't believe it was a satellite- as it was the wrong color and the brightness did not decrease as it went off zenith towards the far horizon as a satellite would have.  I watched it from just north of zenith at about a  020 compass heading------ and  ended at about 150 degrees near the tops of the far pine trees. I estimate I watched it through about 60 degree arc ------ and  for about 2 to 2.5 minutes through that arc.   I watched it move very slowly along the above path.  as it approached the top of the trees to the south-east----  it slowed to nearly a stop---- and then it changed direction to going straight down and behind the trees.  I did not see much decrease in brightness except that would be consistent with the object getting farther away gradually.  It did not \"wink-out\" like satellites do ( which they do long before they get near the tree line)  I am a physicist by degree and have piloted airpcraft.  The object had NO navigation lights of any kind and no tail beacon.  The light did not have the look of a bulb ( a tiny point) either a nav light or a landing light. I compared its color to several passing airliners which were about 10-20 miles away. The aircraft's white lights were more orange than the object.   It was a bright white sphere with the illumination evenly distributed across the whole surface. there seemed no way to estimate how high it could have been.   I don't believe it was any normal aircraft or man made satellite. My location was about 4 miles e-ne of the Orlando international airport.",

My first reaction was, \"Are we getting attacked?\"  However, I didn't hear anything.  Then, the objects slowed down.  They were circular and surrounded by lights, which looked like magenta.  Then, one by one, groups of them made a turn and disappeared.  The picture I finally took are what I call \"the stragglers.\"  By the time I took a picture, there were only a few left.  There were cars on the road.  I put the window down and pointed to the sky.  Not sure if anyone really looked up.  I can only surmise that I am not the only one who saw the objects.  They really were not that high in the sky. The following is what I submitted via website to Orlando International Airport in April 9, 2012:  I was at Lake Buena Vista last night (Saturday, April 7).

It was completely still and had spot lights on the bottom of the craft.  It had some sort of symbols on the bottom of the spacecraft. It was hovering over a neighborhood above houses also.  The symbols were very distinctive.  Almost like two lightning bolts crossed, or swastikas of some sort.  That's the only thing I can compare it to. I turned around and it had disappeared.  It was incredibly large and very low.  It seemed to be right above the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD)",

I was driving North on the 429 heading to Orlando at 2:16 AM, when I saw 5 lights in a straight line shining through the clouds.  They were as big as the moon, but I could not see any objects because they were shining behind clouds.  They were spaced equally, one object being able to fill the gap between the other.  I figured they were spotlights from Disney, but I realized Disney was behind me and there was nothing else that would shine spotlights at 2 AM.  I kept an eye on them, but they suddenly zoomed out as fast as a meteorite travels across the sky.  I couldn't see where they went the first time as I was driving. A few moments later they zoomed back to their original formation. I put my hazards on and pulled off the road.  I tried getting it on video, but it was too dark.  They traveled in a straight line, but in slightly different angles so they were spaced evenly, but farther separated from each other when I looked behind me.  I sat there watching them for about 10 minutes, but they finally zoomed out of view and never came back.  They zoomed out and in probably 2 times in a span of 5 minutes.  They mostly hovered.  They disappeared for about a few minutes, but they came back and zoomed in and out for maybe another 2 or 3 times in a period of 5 minutes.  I ruled out spotlights since they flew out of range that a spotlight has.  It was apparent that they were behind the clouds, and not light being projected onto them.",

      "story": "Very bright white light following a southern trajectory seen 5 minutes prior to Falcon-9 launch from Cape Canaveral I was heading out to my front porch, here in East Orlando, about 5 minutes prior to a Space-X Falcon-9 launch of the Intelsat 35e.  I am about 37-miles west of the Space X complex at Cape Canaveral, and can see the rockets quite clearly when they launch.  As I went out the door, facing east, I noticed a very bright light to the northeast rising upward, about a third of the way off the horizon, initially almost exactly the same speed and curved trajectory a rocket launch would follow to the southeast.  I was upset because I thought I had missed the initial launch.  I tried to shoot a digital movie of the bright light, but it did not come out as far as I can see.  I visually followed the light as it climbed and got smaller and smaller, finally vanishing at high altitude.  I was puzzled because the light was an intense white color, and usually rockets at low altitude display a bright orange flame, as I was thinking I had been watching the Falcon-9 launch, and I\u2019ve seen many launches from the Cape over the last 10-years, and what I thought was the launch just didn\u2019t add up.   A few minutes later, a 7:37 pm (1937 hours) I saw the bright orange flame of the Falcon-9 booster appear just to the southwest, as it climbed and started to leave a contrail as it went into the upper atmosphere.  What really puzzled me, is that I had the impression that the bright light seen a few minutes earlier had been moving a whole lot faster than the rocket after it gained some altitude, I\u2019d say about 4-times faster.  I know they prohibit aircraft in the immediate launch area, and the bright light flew directly through it only a few minutes prior to the actual launch.  I thought maybe an Air Force jet had left the skid strip on afterburner or something, but I was in the Air Force and never saw an afterburner as bright as that.  It was odd, because I really thought I had been watching the launch, and only after I saw the actual launch did I find the whole episode strange.",

On the night of September 9, 2017, around the evening hours of 8-9, I went to take a photo of an eerie moon peaking and hiding behind clouds.  It was a calm breezy evening, basically the calm before the storm.  When I took the photo, it was the night before the great hurricane Irma.  Central Florida (East Orlando) where the photo took place was forecasted to be hit pretty bad by the hurricane on September 10, 2017, in the am hours into Monday morning September 11, 2017.  The photo I took the evening of September 9 showed an eerie moon and a bright light right above the moon in the sky.  When I took a picture of the moon with my cell phone camera I noticed the bright light above the moon. Living North of OIA Orlando International Airport, I see actual planes or helicopters all the time and this image did not look like anything I could identify in normalcy.  As you zoom into the picture the bright light has almost a mushroom shape on top. Interestingly, the area of Central Florida where I live was supposed to be pummeled by the storm, but fortunately my neighborhood and the adjacent neighborhood had minimal damage.  Some downed trees and general debris from wind.  It almost seemed that what I saw that evening in the picture (possible UFO), contributed some how to lessened damage within the radius of where the object could be seen in relation to the hurricane.  I will attach the image with this statement. I'm a Psychology Graduate, and my husband is an Electrical Engineer.",

      "story": "Tonight I was outside watching a gator.  And I noticed these lights behind a tree and I didn't have my glasses on so I didn't think nothing of it.  They sat there for about 5 minutes or so until something clicked in my head.  That thing's been sitting there a long time planes  Do not sit in one spot. it appeared to be closed yet the object was pretty decent size in the sky.  Relative to the tree I was looking at a few hundred yards away it appeared to be not to be much higher than the trees and guessing their relative size of a medium-sized plane. I'm voice typing.  When I realized that thing was acting odd by not moving and the shape of it was hard to explain since I have stigmatism I want know if it's correct.  Anyways when I started filming it it started to move slow and it moved behind a tree not level with the tree.  I don't know how to explain this I did video tape it but couldn't get it to clear up and show everything I was seeing. I thought maybe it was a large drone or a military crafts.  But then I read a guy named Sosa's on here and what he seen pretty much describes what I seen.  It's slowly passing the head and acted sort of like a helicopter but it didn't look like one.  I'm not really certain but I do have videotape.  I hope you guys can read this.  Maybe it's a military crafts and they're waiting to see what kind of reports they get on i   It had one bright light and then a few lights behind it that were smaller one was blinking.  I really can't explain what I seen I've not seen it before.  Because I was standing near my central air and heat I couldn't hear the motor.",

      "story": "Rapidly changing coloured light extremely dissimilar to aircraft lighting seen at airport. \tI work at a major airport in the state of Florida as an airfield electrician.  I am used to, at this point, the general visual characteristics of aircraft lighting as it approaches and departs the airfield, especially since my job depends on being able to get out of the way for landing and taxiing aircraft. \tOn 6/8/2018 at approximately 22:20 local, I stopped in one of our lighting vaults to use the facilities and wished to have a cigarette before going onto the field for the night's work.  This lighting vault is located on a less populated side of the field in a section of airport property that has not yet been developed.  As I stood there and observed various aircraft flying many miles from the field, my eyes were drawn to one light that was behaving EXTREMELY out of character for the lights of an aircraft.  It was rapidly changing colour between red, green, white, yellow and blue.  My first thought was that it looked similar to police lights at night with its rapidly changing colours.  Its approximate position was perhaps 3-5nm to my Northeast and it appeared to be slowly moving in my general direction, displaying inappropriate characteristics of motion for an aircraft.  I do not believe the changes in colour to be due to atmospheric effects because other aircraft were appearing normally as just a white point of light with the occasional strobe, even in the same general region of the sky.  After appearing to slowly move towards me, the object appeared to remain stationary in the air for some seconds before retreating in the distance and then appearing to dim and fade out rather than disappear below the horizon.  I made an attempt to photograph the object, however I only had a cell phone camera and was unable to see the point of light in any photographs taken. \tI work the night shift and have for the past year become well used to the appearance of large and small aircraft navigational lighting in positions from 20nm to 20 feet, furthermore I have become well used to the normal movement of aircraft on approach and departure and am well aware of the visual effects produced by their movement in relation to stars and other aircraft.  At the time of my encounter, I did not have an airband capable radio on my person, but as I returned to my truck about the time the object began to \"fade away\", for lack of a better term, I did not hear any chatter in relation to it on the local control frequency; though I admit I did not check with the various approach/departure frequencies. \tI am not sure what I saw, but I am sure that it displayed characteristics extremely dissimilar to aircraft lighting. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) I'll look for it...though I own an LG 450 flip phone, by design. I am resisting the smartphone push until I cannot avoid it anymore. This was seen visually and I am usually aware about these things. The only mental explanation I can come up with is a rotocraft with amber and blue stroboscopic lights. I could be very wrong, but this is my explanation. ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) I checked out the same place at the same time and saw no object. All I can imagine it to be would be: 1-an aircraft with led approach lights passing through an atmospheric phenomenon causing it to twinkle 2-a rotorcraft with non standard blue and yellow lighting 3-an object that defies conventional explanation.

      "story": "2 craft - in trail formation - both- INGULFED IN FIRE- no sound. Friady evening about 8:15 eastern time. Orlando fl. about 4 miles due north of Orlando international airport. They sky was 100% overcast-- looked to be 6 or 8,000 feet up--- as the departing jetliners at probably 4 and 5,000 were below it. I was outside making prepirations for the the approaching hurricane Dora (sic.  Dorian). Just at begining of twilight.  Stepped out of my shop to look at a virgin atlantic 747 departing for europe.  (Reckegnised it by its sound.) As I watched it go by south to north- I was facing east and it was passing above my eastern horizon and tree line in the distance.  It was about 5 miles away so I turned go inside and my eyes caught a light just over the trees as I was facing due east. At first I assumed it was some kind of plane because the sky was full of departing and approaching - both near and far.  Immediately I noticed that whatever it was appeared to be on fire.   And it was headed my way with some speed.   I thought -- if thats a plane-- he wont be flying much longer with THAT MUCH fire.  whatever it was -- it appeared to be engulfed in fire from every part of it.   I could see flames blowing out of it from all sides. I briefly thought of running away as it seemed to be heading right for me-- at least in its heading.  It seemed to be holding its altitude--- not descinding at all.  I ran to my shop door- about 20 feet away where I often keep binoculars hanging on a cabinet door-- but they were gone. I got my cheap flip phone and put it on video--- tried to center it in the screen--- and them tried to zoom it while keeping the object in the screen. By that time it was about directly overhead . I could hear NO NOISE at all.  So I rulled out a plane or a drone.  I could still see flames blowing out of it on every side - like it was a fire that was being actively fed---- I could also see NO smoke trail like a plane might have made (especially a jet- if it had burning jet fuel- which would have been very smokey---)  i believe after the video ends--- I continued to watch it untill it disappeared behind the western tree line. My mind was kind of overwhelmed trying to figure out what I had just seen-----  I stood there a moment-- and turned around and saw another one of the same thing above the easter tree line---- exactly like the first. I tried to get another video but only got a few sec. of this one.   I also watched this one approach the western tree like like the first one did.   It seemed to be engulfed in fire just like the first one.  just brfore it got down to the tree line--- I saw what appeared to be a halo appear which looked like a half sphere. It lasted about 2 or 3 sec.   ( reminded me of the umbrella shaped plume when a rocket's 2-nd stage lights at the edge of space--) It looked like I was looking at the back end of this thing- and the halo was symetrical around it--- After about 2 or 3 sec. of this halo---- all the fire abruptly ended----- I strained to look--- and I could see a distinct outline of some kind of dark object with sharply defined edges. The sky still has a little diffuse light and I could see it highlighted against it.  with only having my naked eye--- I  couldnt quite tell if its shape was square or cylindrical ro what geeometrical shape it looked like-- just that I could see sharp well defined edges---- and the fact that it seemed to be very large. Just before the fire ceased--- its position merged with that of a jetliner about 4 miles away (departing the furthet of the 4 runways) and its angular size appeared about 4 times bigger than the distant plane.  Of coarse I have no distance information-- all I know is that it was below the cloud deck.  Since the clouds were 100% -- if it had been above them I never could seen it at all.  The distant jetliners were probably 6 or 8,000 feet I woul dguess and they were below the cloud deck too.  So it had to be below that.   My first impression upon seeing the first one was that it was maybe 3000 or 4000 feet (when I thought it was a plane on fire---)  The time between the first one and 2-nd one was maybe 30 sec.  I would guess they may have taken 1 min to go from tree line to tree line.  I truely can not guess what this could have been.  It did NOT seem to resemble any UFO report I have ever heard. I checked the wind about a half an hour later.  It was out of the NE and the objects were going very close to from east to west.   The only thing I could think of was some of those rigs that people some times release that have a white paper bag with a candle below---like a hot air baloon.  However it didnt seem to be following the wind-- and if it was a paper bag that had caught on fire --THAT would have burned up within a few sec. as well as loosing its ability to remain aloft.  It would have droped like a rock.  At one point when I was watching the first object coming towards me---- I all most thought I could see a tiny faint steady point of light on each side of the fire-- like just near the outer edges of the fire. All most like a very faint wing tip light.  The only other thing I might immagine it could be ---- was some kind of upper atmosphere-near space plasma or electric discharge powered plane.  That might explain the appearance of a billowing fire--- the halo---- no noise--- an another thing.  The course these things were on -- was just about exactly the path I used to see air force planes commuting from Patric AFB (near port canaveral) to McDill AFB (Tampa).  I wonder if that --- and the fact there was a 2-nd one in trail behind the first one--- is a hint that maybe the air force was involved ????? That was what I saw !  It was very odd !",
