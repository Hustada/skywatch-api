There were no markings visible are lights on \"craft,\" the craft itself was very dark colored. A very scary experience. Saw by four people, and they were all quite terified. It suddenly shot upwards, and disappeared or vanished just above tree line. Left behind something similiar to a vapor trail.

They had no lights at all and were sillouetted against a bridge in the distance. They seemed to be even lower than a helicopter would fly. I drew a picture of these 3 cigar shapes when I got home and only have reported this now as I read about identical descriptions. I saw them for maybe 20 seconds before they passed.

      "story": "My boyfriend, our friend, and I were sitting on our second floor front deck that looks out towards the Peter's Hill section of the The Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain (an area of Boston proper) having dinner. Our house is up on a hill so we can see well over the few rooftops below us that look to the South West sky towards Needham and Route 128/95 - it's all tree tops from the park looking towards the horizon. As we were eating I looked up to speak to my BF and a very bright light in the sky behind him caught my eye - it wasn't there a minute before. No other stars were out since the horizon was a pale yellow and the sky above shades of blue - it was just starting dusk - but not nearly dark yet and a very clear night. I pointed out the light and the two people saw it and agreed it was really bright  - and stationary in the sky. They were puzzled by it as was I. I said it's probably a planet but I'll watch it and see if it moves across the sky. I would estimate it was 20-30 degrees above the horizon. I observed it for about eight minutes without it moving in the slightest. I then went inside to grab something from the kitchen (maybe 15 seconds) and when I returned it was nowhere in sight... and it couldn't have possibly moved behind something since we were so high up and could see for miles around it - nothing would have obstructed the view. It just vanished. We didn't see it again. Other aircraft were visible and easily identifiable and nowhere near this light. No sound was heard but that's not surprising seeing how we felt it was miles away.  We are all professional men and women. Ph.d., Actuary and an I.T. Director. None of us were inebriated.",

We got lost and I looked up into the sky and noticed a giant bright white star.  To my eyes, it appeared diamond shaped. I watched it as we drove towards it and noticed it did not change directions or even move.  It stayed perfectly still. My friend thought it was a star until we noticed clouds moving behind it.  We had no idea what it could of been. As we turned around to try and find our way through the city on search of the club we were going to. We moved away from the giant star like object.  I could no longer keep it in my eye of view. But for 5 whole minutes during that time of driving towards it, I watched it from the car window.  Did not take my eye off of it.  I wanted to make sure it wasn't a plane or something more explainable. We ended up getting lost again until we were right back where the giant white reflective star was and I saw it again.  This time it had moved towards the west side and again was sitting perfectly in the sky that had no stars in it.  Since Boston is very bright, you normally don't see stars. We ignored the object and drove away to find our destination.  At 2:30am after we got out of the club, I looked for it again on our drive home and did not see it. Description:  This object seemed large, diamond or circular shaped.  It was silent.  Stayed perfectly still. All electronic devices in our car were working (cellphone and other gadgets)  If it did move, it moved very slowly then paused.  Moved up and down behind the clouds then back out again to where you could noticed the clouds behind it.  Very bright and color was off white.  It was Glowing.

After about 3 min of observing it, it gained a tremendous amount of speed and jumped or flew off the building. I than observed it.

I am a US Navy veteran, and was with a friend of mine, who is a US Army veteran, on the evening of 23AUG2012 at approx. 2030Hrs, when we both noticed a unique light array approaching us from the north.  We were both sitting on the open plaza at Boston City Hall Plaza this night.  This light array resembled nothing we had ever seen before, as we are closely familiar with military, commercial, and private aircraft, as well as blimps, dirigibles, hot air balloons, and ultralight craft. As this light array got closer, we noticed that there were NO red & green (port & starboard) lights, NO wing lights, nor were there any type of landing (approach) lights seen anywhere on this craft.  Also very noticeable was the fact that there was absolutely NO sound whatsoever associated with this craft. Less than 5-10 minutes before we noticed this light array, there was an airplane on its approach to Boston's Logan Airport, and this light array did NOT resemble any other known craft. I estimate the approximate speed of this craft to be between 25-35MPH, which gave me sufficient time to get a detailed look at it, and later to sketch out the details that I saw. Sketch to follow in a separate mailing, as I have no current access to a scanner to electronically email it out to NUFORC. As this light array passed directly overhead, we both noticed that it was definitely triangular in shape, the outer body being a very black color, with an inner structure a light black or dark gray color. There were 3 white lights on each corner (rimmed in a gold/yellowish color), with a very large bright white light in the direct center of this craft, also rimmed in the same gold/yellowish color, and at the stern of this craft were 2 red lights, near the rear points of this triangle shape, equidistant apart from one another. This craft did NOT cast any shadow or reflected light to the ground, had NO sound even as it passed overhead, and continued directly south until it disappeared behind some tall buildings. Less than 5 minutes later, a twin-engine airplane passed overhead, going from east to west, and this craft we witnessed was nothing like the plane we saw moments later. Being military veterans, we both discussed what exactly we witnessed that evening, ruling out all known aircraft very familiar to us, and have no answers to this unique UAP/UFO sighting. But we know exactly what we DID see that night, and this triangular craft is something not of our current military, as we do not have this type of current technology at this time.",

I walked onto the Common from the NW corner and immediately saw a bright orange light in the sky. At  first, through the trees, I thought it might be a planet and marked its position so I could check on it again when I got to open space. When I did, it had moved and was closer. Being near Logan Airport, I first thought plan or helicopter but there were no blinking lights and it receded to the South South East. At this time I was out on open ground and the first light was out of sight, I saw another single orange light approach from the SW (from my perspective, approaching from the left side of the Hancock tower). It approached at speed, hovered for a minute or two, and then receded to the SSE. At this point there were other people walking through the Common and also looking up, seeing the bright orange light and remarking at it. After the second light was out of sight a third fo! llowed the exact same trajectory in, hovered and receded to the SSE. I decided to go inside, proceeded to tell my wife about the lights and looked out the window to see if there was another out there and there was. I grabbed my binoculars and what I thought I could see was the bright orange light and 2/3rds of whitish eggish shape to the bottom.  This light, like the others, receded to the SSE. I periodically checked out the window the remainder of the evening and saw no other lights.  A couple of other notes: While I was out on the Common, I saw 2 large jetliners take off from Logan and come relatively close to these lights. One of those two times, I thought it was dangerously close,  but it allowed to give a guess at the altitude of the lights, which I would say was between 1,000-2,000 feet.  Also, while I could clearly hear the sound that the jets taking off we're making, and a helicopter to the North, these lights made no sound that I could hear. While I am aware of Chinese Lanterns, these lights each approached at what I would call \"aircraft speeds\", hovered and receded at 90 degree angle from origin at a similar speed.",

      "story": "White circular UFO outside Boston disappears--then reappears atop neon orange vertical-ellipse-shaped cloud & witnessed to Hartford CT. Immediately after emerging from the Boston tunnels, headed Westbound on I-90, I saw a constant stationary illumination, circular and white, directly ahead of us.  Too large and too early in the day to be a star, I pointed it out to my husband, who was driving.  We joked about it, but I kept watching.  Heading due-west, I realized it was moving North and South, but there was no smoke trail.  As soon as I opened my mouth to mention it to my husband, he exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s moving!\u201d  Very soon after, it seemed to stop moving North-South, but the light got smaller and smaller until it disappeared from sight. Minutes later, we were passing over a body of water by a Framingham exit.  The reflection looked orange, so I looked up, expecting to see sunset starting.  Instead, the sky was bright blue and clear of clouds, except for one, which was directly ahead of us.  It was neon orange in color, a vertical ellipse in shape, about 40 azimuth from the horizon, about 10 azimuth in height.  I joked in less technical terms that it looked like female genitalia. I do a lot of sky gazing, I\u2019ve never seen a cloud like this, my jaw was in my chest, eyes trained on it.  I remarked that it looked like it was glowing brighter, and the constantly white UFO reappeared at the very top of the elliptical cloud, growing from pinpoint in size to the same size as we had originally seen it.  The cloud dissipated within seconds, from the top down, looking more purple as it dissipated.  There was a bright white flash at the very top of the UFO, and a few seconds later it seemed to momentarily change from white to a faint green, but I don\u2019t remember if this was before or after the cloud dissipated. It was difficult to gauge if the UFO was moving or hovering after that, due to the winding roads. It fell out of sight a few times when we dropped in altitude, (particularly Westbound on I/84). The diameter of the illumination was consistent until we neared the Hartford, Connecticut area, when it seemed to grow larger, and appeared to be hovering South of Hartford. We lost sight of it when we exited in New Britain, Connecticut, and we couldn\u2019t see it at our final destination.",

It was after I had lost the first three that I looked back to the South and saw more lights in no particular formation, but on the same heading and altitude, about 15-20 went by in total.  By the time these showed up, 5 other witnesses had spotted them from below my vantage and confirmed what I had seen.  On the level I was, there had been another witness as well.  Also, of note was a cruise ship that had departed and been in the channel fairly close by at the time. There were no clouds, but I could not make out any stars prior to or during the event; winds minimal and temperature mild. The lights moved at a steady speed, approximately 50-70 knots, a steady altitude, and in full unison towards the North. No sounds could be heard emanating from them, or other lights.  Shape and exact size could not be determined. The lights/what they were attached to were clearly under intelligent control whether it is ours or not I can not say. I was able to get two cell phone videos but they did not catch very well the extent of what I saw. I did notice that after all of the lights had passed, a helicopter had followed close behind and proceeded towards the North, but avoiding Logan airspace-it did not appear military and was plainly visible.  It should be noted that these lights continued through Logan airspace without regard to it. Of note is that a line of landing airplanes could be seen coming from the North and landing at Logan-very close together and I had not seen them do this for the two months I had been here-once the objects passed, some planes had refrained from touching down and began to gain altitude to continue their flights.",
