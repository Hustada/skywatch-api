      "story": "Enormous UFO Arlington, Texas Although I have given the date of my sighting as December of 1993, I am unsure of the exact date.  I was driving East on Arkansas Lane in Arlington Texas in early afternoon.  As I topped the hill and approached the intersection of Park Springs and Arkansas Lane I saw an enormous oval shaped disk that appeared to be made of highly polished silver, hovering over the City of Grand Prairie, Texas, which is the City to East of Arlington and about 10 miles from the intersection I was approaching.  It seemed to me to be about the width of a football field or two and was much larger on the horizon than the Dalworthington Gardens Water tower that came into view as I approached the next traffic light at the corner of Spanish Trail and Arkansas Lane.  The strange thing about this sighting is that the UFO appeared to be appearing and disappearing as it sort of wobbled while sitting there in the sky.  Although I did not see any airliners at that time, The UFO seemed to be sitting well above the trees that were visible to me and just under a landing flight path to DFW Airport that I generally always see a plane or two making a final approach when I travel East on Arkansas Lane.  Sometime before this sighting, I remember hearing about some one or some group trying to project a picture of Christ in the skyline above New York City and at first I thought that because the UFO was appearing and disappearing that perhaps that was happening here also.  However, this was in broad daylight.  I looked to my left, intending to honk at the white pick up truck to my left and call the driver's attention to what ever this was.  However when I looked at the driver, I could see that the gentleman driving the truck had his mouth open and was looking at the same sight I was seeing.  I continued down Arkinsas Lane and the UFO continued to hover and appear and disappear until I reached the intersection of Bowen Rd. and Arkansas Lane.  Then the UFO disappeared and never appeared again.  The next day, I was again in my car listening to either the local Classical or Oldies but Goodies Radio station, when the announcer made the following addition to a short news break, \"All you people in Arlington, who called in to report what you thought was a UFO yesterday were actually seeing a weather baloon.\"  I was not one of those people who called in, but I do know that what I saw was no weather baloon.  At the time of my sighting, I did not have a computer.  Two years later when I did purchase one, I began a search that continues today for someone, anyone who saw this same UFO  I am unsure of the date and even the exact year, but I know that others must have seen it and either called the authorities or a radio a station to report it.",

We could see the moon to the East South East,  and it was big but not yet full. It was bright. The sky was dark blue. There were no stars visable yet ,due to the still illuminated sky.  At 8:57 I stared at the moon again, this time to see a bright star to the Right of it ( as seen in the video).  It was so bright I thought it was a planet. Not knowing my stars, I just wondered.  As I spent  a minute looking\u2026it started to travel to the Right (south) about the same distance it was from the moon. It only took 5 seconds to cover that distance. Then it dead stopped.  It really caught my eye. My husband was now watching it. Then it moved Left , back to the original position. ( Video was taken after the movement) We decided to move inside the house at that point. At 10:25 pm we thought we could find some other stars to look at. We grabbed a white painters cloth and laid it in the backyard , I brought my strong flashlight with me. The sky was black with many stars . Within 1 minute, we again saw a bright star (among many that were visible that night) We were facing the West on a slight incline in the yard. Our heads were higher than our feet on this slope. We were facing Ball Mountain. Within a minute , we found a bright star traveling from right to left.(north to south) Then it stopped.  At this point I teased my husband and said,\u201d hey lets call it over, maybe it can see us.\u201d I waved the flashlight up and down and left and right about 5 times, immediately  this star started moving in our direction  (now it headed East).  It traveled quickly and directly towards our part of the sky. When it got close , it stopped. We were really frightened. I was sorry I flashed the light at it. We picked up the cloth and ran into the house. We did not go back outside. We did not speak about it. We do not know what we saw. We don\u2019t want to know. \u2013 I do not think satellites change course like that. I don\u2019t know if spy drones fly at night. I am unable to research this to my satisfaction. These flying stars were the brightness and size of a night time star. ( no trails, no other colors) If anyone can explain, we would be grateful.",

      "story": "My wife and I witnessed a dark shadow moving down our sidewalk when nothing was there to make a shadow for an entire block. After moving into my wife's house in Arlington Washington, near Arlington airport back in 2004 we witnessed something extraordinary while clearing and plowing a new garden in our backyard. Our cat suddenly started to act odd and was making strange yowling noises. She then suddenly jumped over our wood fence into the front yard in a run. That struck me as very odd. So I looked through the slits between the fence boards to see where she was going.  As I peered through the slits between the boards of the fence I saw a shadow moving down the sidewalk outside our house. At first I didn't think much of it. But then the alarms went off when I realized that shadow was showing up on the ground under the shade of a very large tree we have in our front yard. How can there be a shadow inside a very shaded area? That is when I looked again, but closer. Then I saw it. a thick very black shadow on the ground that was moving from 176th PL NE on 39th Dr NE in a south direction on the sidewalk past our house. I then noticed not only was our cat following this shadow on the ground, but a few other cats from our neighborhood were also following it. Ever seen a cat go after a laser pointer? That is exactly what all the cats were doing. Like they were trying to catch it. I know it wasn't just the shadow that attracted them because of the way our cat sensed it from the other side of the fence in our backyard. It was really weird.  Then I pulled my head over the fence to look straight at it. This thing was invisible when you looked at it straight on, you couldn't see it at all. You could only see it when looking through the small gaps between the boards of our fence. It was moving slowly. To me it looked like the shape of a guy in a space suit pulling a kids wagon. I called my wife over to look. It took her a while to see it, and it didn't register with her that it was something unusual. I had to point it out to her. I said \"It's a shadow in the shade\"! Then she got it and her eyes got big. We watched it until it moved too far down the street for us to see it anymore. The last thing we could see were the cats following it because the street turns sharply just a few houses down and changes name to 175th PL NE. We decided whatever it was we didn't want to mess with it or investigate further. Especially since we couldn't see it looking straight at it.  Another caveat to this story is we had a child's wading pool full of water in our front yard. It had no leaks. I say this because it would hold water all day long. But all this same week leading up to this anomaly (shadow thing), at night the kid wading pool would get completely drained. As if something or someone was siphoning out all the water. I kept filling it back up and testing it for leaks. It would hold all day everyday, but be empty in the morning.  A few days after all this happened someone from Snohomish water conservation came to offer us \"free rain barrels making class\". She seemed very interested in striking up conversation. She was cute, blond, late 20s to early 30s. But she just stood there not saying anything after introducing herself and handing me the pamphlet about the class. But she was waiting for me to say something. It was REALLY strange and awkward. I got the distinct intuition that it was related to the shadow we witnessed and the disappearing water. Whatever that thing was, they knew about it and wanted to help us put water out for it. They knew it was taking water off of our property and they were trying to get us to provide water at that location for it. We went to the class and I did set up that rain-barrel. But I put cameras on it. Nothing ever showed up and I never noticed water missing from that rain barrel. I still get newsletters from that group at Snohomish water conservation to this! day. I never posted anything because I didn't know where to post it! And the whole thing seemed too far fetched to tell people about. Seems appropriate here among all the glowing lights people report. http://snohomishcd.org/rain-barrel-program/",

      "story": "Close Call with Huge Triangular Craft I was driving home at approximately 2:30-3:00 a.m., heading north on I-5 from Everett to Arlington. It was a clear night. As I approached the Smokey Point Exit, I noticed a very bright white light (the size of a bright star) traveling from the east to west. It was several miles north of my location. At first, I thought it was a shooting star. But it wasn\u2019t moving as quickly, and it was blinking at the rate of about once per second as it moved across the sky. I watched it for several seconds, and thought perhaps it was a satellite. As soon as that idea crossed my mind, the light suddenly shot back the way that it came, zipped up, zipped north, and then shot east again...and disappeared. It startled me quite badly, and I felt nervous as I continued off I-5 at the Smokey Point (#206) exit. I kept searching the sky, looking for the mysterious light, thinking it might reappear near the place that it had disappeared.  As I turned east and came to stop at the light at Smokey Point Boulevard, I glanced around and looked directly up. I was terrified to see an extremely large triangular object hovering directly above the intersection. It was so low that the streetlights shined on its underside, highlighting large rectangular shaped panels and what appeared to be rivets that were spaced very far apart.  I can\u2019t describe the size of the craft, because it extended beyond my scope of vision lengthwise, and I could see clusters of small white lights that indicated the shape. Could it be that they saw my headlights, and traveled to the intersection where I was heading toward? It HAD to be more than a coincidence.  I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I looked around for other people who might see what I was seeing, but there were no other cars around, and no people to be seen at the 7-11 store on the corner.  Even after all I\u2019d witnessed, I really hoped that my imagination was playing tricks on me, so I looked up and expected that \"it\" would be gone. But, it was still there.  I then noticed that it made no noise and created no turbulence in the air. I got SO frightened that I ran the red light, turning north onto Smokey Pt. Boulevard and drove as fast as I could all the way home. I never heard any other reports of this.  It has bothered me ever since, and I am uncomfortable to this day about looking skyward.

I recently started looking through NUFORC.com in hopes of finding a similar sighting, which my father and I saw together. I was startled to find that someone had posted a sighting of the very object we saw and even stranger that the UFO was in the same town, on the same date, at the same time, and moving in the same direction - West to East.  We were just oustide my new home in Arlington, TX, when the object caught our attention. We both looked up and saw a rather large black trianglular object moving very slowy and seemingly very low, directly above us. The object was pitch black, against the night sky, with several large circular, but very dim, lights underneath. No other deatails could be made out and it seemed to glide accross the sky, in complete silence, and then it just dissappeared, soon after it passed overhead. The whole incident lasting only a minute.  The report I found of this sighting in NUFORC.com was seen from a different angle than myself, and the other viewer was able to see some more detail than I remember, however, I was able to see the lights underneath in more detail than what the other report describes. There were at least 5 perfectly round lights that were evenly dim, I was able to see them, but they did not give off any rays of light.  There is no stranger feeling in this world than experiencing a UFO, especially when it comes so close. It is gratifying to know someone else saw the same object. But even stranger it would be over 30 years before I would find that out.",

Something made me look up at the sky to the east where I saw the ending of an explosion of a giant ball of white/golden light. It faded entirely and then what remained a little off to the side of where the light had been was a vibrant, yet misty purple/blue/yellow haze which faded slowly and then disappeared completely, returning the sky to blackness. I likened the purplish haze to that of a nebula \u2013 the colors, patterns and shape of the mist resembled photos of nebulae I have seen. Unfortunately, my mother was inside the house and I was the only one to witness the whole thing. I posted the story on a couple of UFO websites, hoping to find someone who had witnessed the event as well yet received no response. The entire event happened very quickly, but still after all this time, it still leaves me unsettled and baffled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I heard what I thought was a lifeline (hospital), helicopter hovering over the nearby hospital. However the engines were too loud for a smaller search and rescue type helicopter. So my attention was drawn to see what was evidently on a path that would bring it very close to my house. As I looked to see what kind of helicopter it was, suddenly I noticed two bright lights traveling together in a straight path approximately a hundred feet apart. They were moving at least three hundred to four hundred miles an hour approximately a hundred and fifty feet in front of the helicopter. All three aircraft were traveling at only around three hundred feet in altitude. Directly in pursuit of the two lights was a very large, single rotor, obviously military helicopter with all of its flashing lights. The two lights made no noise, and had no other flashing or strobe lights- (proximity lights), just two \"star-like\" lights. I did not realize what I was watching until after the event. The two lights were traveling in a very straight path almost as if they were trying to elude the military helicopter, or possibly the helicopter was escorting them. The whole event only lasted for aproximately 30 seconds. It took three seconds for all aircraft to cross the night sky over my head. I could not make out any shape around each of the two unidentified lights I am not sure what I had just witnessed, but this was very unusual. I have been an Airworthiness Inspector for over twenty years and in aircraft for thirty, and I have never seen anything like this.

I had one of my skeptical work mates look at it, and all she could say was that it had to be tethered to something.  It was raining here this morning with a slight breeze.

The loud booms and lights in the sky were fireworks from a nearby racetrack in Kennedale, Tx. at 10:30pm to 12:30 am. It turns out the emergency vehicles in the parking lot of the supposed crash were part of a candlelight vigil for a skateboarder killed the night before on the access road of I-20 at that location. The two incidents were separated by 3 hours, and the military convoy just happened to pass by at the time of the vigil, around 9:30 pm, and there were entrance ramps to the freeway at that location blocked for the passing of the oversized load.",

As I contunued to watch the object travel towards the East I noticed it splitting into two objects. One object headed North and the other kept traveling towards the East. I was able to watch both objects for a couple of minutes until they disapeared into the night. The weather was clear and breezey with a slight haze covering the sky. The objects were identical - both round and reddish - moving fast and erratically. I've worked near the airport for almost 12 years and Ive never witnessed anything like that before.",

I noticed the light and advised my entire family to come out and observe as I noticed it was moving South slowly and was a color light I have never seen on an aircraft before.  As we watched, it started moving faster to the South, only to be amazed that a helicopter was following the blue light.  This struck fear as we continued to watch, when suddenly, the light shot back in the direction it was going, and immediately dropped below the house line. I ran into the house and grabbed my video camera.  The light returned and in a similar, but not exactly the same pattern, flew the same path running at very wild speeds. I was able to capture the light but due to how dark it was, kept having to zoom in and out to get a clear example of the brightness of the blue. It finally dropped again and was never seen again.  The sky was dark and very clear so this was by no means a spotligh! t as most of us were thinking.  I have the video but am not sure who to share it with for fear or rejection, but 5 of the most honest people I know watched this light move back and forth with no idea what it was we were watching.",

My parents witnessed this with me and no explanation.   Well on Sunday night, the object returned, only this time, we were closer to the object.  I noticed it while at the bank, it appeared as 2 bright blue lights, a electric blue in which no other plane I have ever seen has had.   I called my wife who was around the corner getting yogurt, and then also saw the object. I took care of bank business as I watched the object move east and I thought it was going to disappear.  When I met with my wife a moment later, we clearly saw the object almost directly above us, and thought it was a helicopter until it completed a roll move and was clearly 3 bright blue lights in the shape of a triangle with red and white lights on the belly. In the few minutes seen, the object would roll back and forth showing the triangle s! hape, but then rolling back and appear as just 2 lights.  My wife, my mother in law, and I all stood in awe as we watched the object slowly lower itself as if about to land, I ran to grab a better camera as the shots and video taken on my iphone were unclear due to the night sky, to truly make out the triangle, but the color of the light was captured.  Before I could get back, my wife yelled that it had suddenly dropped at a high rate a speed behind our view.  There are softball fields where this would have landed, but upon driving to the area, the only thing I found were the end of the softball league games, and several police officers in the parking lot.  I assumed they were there for softball boozers, not space invaders.",

I am 47 years old and worked in Law Enforcement for 6 years.  I was driving home to Portage, Wisconsin from Madison, Wisconsin. I was driving north on State Highway 51 approaching Johnson Auto Sales (N1255 US Highway 51, Arlington, WI). My Son (14 years old) was in the front passenger seat, my wife was in the back seat. I saw an extremely low flying aircraft in the sky just northwest of Johnson sales.  The object appeared to be moving very slowly to the south, toward my vehicle.  Hwy 51 was busy with traffic, vehicles were northbound behind me and in front of me.  There were also several vehicles passing me southbound. I pointed to the aircraft and asked my son what he thought it was.  My son said he thought it might be a helicopter.  My wife, a Nurse, said that maybe it was a med-flight helicopter. The aircraft continued to move southeast and began hovering just west of my car, right over the Johnson Sales retail store. I slowed way down and could immediately see that the aircraft was not a helicopter or a conventional airplane.  It was hovering approximately 1000 ft above Johnson sales.   My son and I both saw that the aircraft had two distinct white headlamps.  The headlamps had approximately 20 feet of separation.   We also saw a third white headlamp toward the rear of the aircraft... and all three headlamps formed a triangle).  There were two blue lights on the right triangular wing, and two red lights on the left triangular wing.  The body shape of the aircraft closely resembled that of a thin triangular spur. I rolled my window down expecting to hear an aircraft engine or rotor blades, but the aircraft was completely silent. I pulled into the Johnson Sales parking lot.  The aircraft immediately moved silently and slowly to the south, almost as though it knew we were trying to observe it more closely.  My wife was afraid and asked me not to try to follow it.   The aircraft continued to move south and I drove my family home.  My son, 14 years old, drew a sketch of the aircraft and we just can't seem to stop talking and thinking about this remarkable event.  There were many vehicles on Hwy 51 at the time, and I was just wondering if anyone else may have reported seeing this strange aircraft.  If so, I would be interested to know.",

I was walking home around 10:30 at night in Arlington, Virginia, just a few miles from Washington, DC.  Suddenly I saw a dazzling white, oval-shaped light fall from the sky at a constant rate and disappear over buildings on the horizon.  There was no sound.  The light was bright enough that it cast shadows around me. The oval was an even and pure white light.  I was bigger than a full moon.  I have no idea how far away it was, but didn't seem more than a few miles if that. I am an aviation enthusiast and have fulfilled all requirements for my private pilots license.  I cannot explain what I saw.  It was not a meteor because it seemed too large and had no tail.  It was not an aircraft.  The light was pure white and dazzling. The next day my carpool mate picked me up.  I was only a few hundred feet from his house when I saw the light.  He had been watching TV in his living room which faced the same direction I had been walking.  He told me that the room had filled with a bright white light at the same time I saw the object.  So I had independent corroboration. I called the Arlington police the next day to report it.  No one had seen anything.  I think the woman at the police station thought I was a nut. My carpool mate similarly thought I was nuts for reporting it. I still can't explain what I saw.  Anyone ever see something similar?

It was by far the brightest object in the sky, and was heading in the northeastern direction. I watched it for about 20 seconds, and then it just faded away.  I would say it was an orb shape, and was reddish-orange in color. It was not the ISS or a satellite or a shooting star. I have actually seen a number of these in the past few years now.",

      "story": "Low rumble revealed sparkling lights, resolved into dark Triangular craft with lighting at two leading edges. As I sat in my studio, I was beginning to get ready for bed.  I emptied my pockets onto my desk and thought that I should go out side before my shower.  As this was the second time in a few minutes that I had thought about going outside, I stopped what I was doing, lit a smoke,  and walked to the back door, opened it, and walked onto the patio.  I noticed that there was a distant rumbling sound that seemed loud, loud  enough that I wondered why I had not heard it inside my house.  The sound was much like the sound of a jet engine, without the usual high pitched whine.  Just the low frequency component of the sound like an Atlas rocket at a distance, or maybe a Harrier jet.  I am a professional audio engineer, and have very good hearing. I'll also point out that I grew up in the Land Surveying business, working many years in that field before my mid 20's.  Since the security lighting had activated when I went onto the patio, I reached my hand back inside the door and turned off the light to get a better look at the sky.  Still hearing the rumble, I looked up to see what it could be. Above me about 60 degrees above the horizon, and due west, I saw an odd haze that would sparkle light, mostly white, with red and blue green. My first thought was that it was too low to be an airplane, and that it did not appear to be moving fast enough for flight.  The sound was incorrect for it to be a helicopter.  The lights seemed to twist and turn, with no discernible shape.  As the sky was otherwise clear, this confused me.  I noticed that there was an occasional brighter flash in red and then blue green.  The object continued to morph, and as I watched, it solidified into a shape.  It became an equilateral triangle with one end pointed directly south.  The object seemed dangerously close to the ground and just hanging there. With my right hand outstretched to 30 inches, the object was about 9 -12 inches on each side, and about \u00bd to \u00be inches thick. The lights appeared along the perimeter of the two leading edges, with the brightest areas at the middle of each of those two edges.  I noticed that the southern most tip of the triangle had a soft white glow, and that the remainder of the bottom was a dull dark matt finish. The light area did not appear to be illuminated, only contrasted to the rest of the surface.   Much to my surprise, the bottom was not flat.  There appeared to be two large rectangular areas, one on each side of the center line, and while one was along the axis of (very slow) travel, the other was at 90 degrees to it.  The rectangular boxes had rounded edges.  I remember thinking, that this was not a good aerodynamic shape. Another incongruity. Once the position of the object stabilized, the lighted edges were barely visible from my perspective, but the occasional brightening of the nearest mid-side light was red.  I thought, maybe they were FAA lights, so I waited for the next flash.  The flashing did not have consistent timing.  The next time it was green, and still hazy in a digital sort of way.  Checking the far side lights, I realized that they were also inconsistently colored also..  It was more like the lights were displayed as camouflage, something that would appear correct to the casual observer. Wanting to take a photo, I realized that I did not have a camera on me, and that in order to get a photo I would have to get back into the studio, grab my phone off the desk and turn it on.  By this time, the object was already 45 degrees south of my position and I realized that I did not have time to get to the camera, and I decided to just continue watching.  The object continued south and within a few seconds had moved to the horizon, the sparkle growing ever smaller and less distinct. I have some surveillance cameras located around my house, and I later checked to footage.  I left the studio at 11:15 pm CDT to go outside, and the event lasted barely 2 minutes.  I saved the recordings from the system and looked at it later, hoping that some more information could come from it.  The studio camera has an audio channel, but the camera over the patio does not.  I could not detect any low frequency information from the sound track, as the noise floor on such systems is rather high.",

I stood still to see if it was moving or not, and sure enough it was. I stepped out my sliding back door right next to my kitchen, and watched it.  I could now notice some stars, but there were some clouds out as well.  I kept my eye on this orb, as it seemed to move from north to south.  Then all of the sudden, it slowly faded away in about 4-5 seconds. I watched this orb for about one minute. I kept watching the skies after that to see if it would come back.  I noticed a fairly close group of stars in the northern sky, when one of the \u201cstars\u201d that had been motionless for the past couple of minutes, started moving northeast and then faded away in about 4-5 seconds just like the last object I witnessed.

I thought it was unusual for a plane that might normally approach from this direction.   As it approached 2 other similar reddish lights appeared on the northeast horizon.   It appeared they were close to each other but began to diverge as they came closer.  The first light began to fade as it went overhead.   The 2nd red light/object grew somewhat brighter as it approached. I thought how weird is this.   Finally the first object faded overhead at some distance, the 2nd and 3rd approaching began to separate, they originally approached close to each other.   The 2nd came straight over head.   As it did I detected a circular shadow against the clouds and a dark segment circulating clock wise within the shadow.   The 3rd 'light' seemed to diverge and fade to the west as I watched the 2nd, which was surprisingly low and appeared to be descending.  The shadowy circular shape was amazing.   Within seconds I saw it h! it silently, \"collapse\" and fall from the side of a neighbor's roof 40 yards away.   It feel off the roof toward the ground and remains to be determined what it is.

      "story": "Strange Green/Purple and Orange Dancing Lights Above Farm Field 10/2/13  On the night of 10/02/2013 at around 23:30 I took my dog outside for his last break before bed.  When we walked onto our deck (looking due north)- I could clearly see unusual lights coming from the farm fields located directly behind our rural property.  We live on a hill with clear visibility for at least \u00bd to \u00be mile to the north.  I noticed that my small dog would not leave my side.  Normally he would be off sniffing in the darkness for  ocal small wild animals etc\u2026  It was quite unusual for him to stick close to me- in fact he kept walking right back to the door like he wanted to go inside instead of have his last late night romp.  I guess you would say he was acting out of character. I was a bit shaken by what I witnessed in the night sky.  First of all- the night sky was very clear with awesome visibility of the stars.  However- I witnessed something I have never witnessed before.  It looked to me quite a bit like the aurora borealis directly behind by property.  There was what appeared to be a misty quality to the area from the ground and up for approx 100 feet or so- but ONLY in the due north direction.  There were also beams of straight light that appeared to be coming from the sky down (or from the ground up) into this misty green and purple hazy lit up area (the color was green closer to the ground- and had a tint of purple the higher it went- also it seemed to have a bit of a sparkly aspect to it as well).   What was very odd about this is that directly above where these lights were- and where the spotlights stopped up in the air- I could not make out what was above that.  It was a clear black out.  Normally I would see stars in this area of the s! ky- but it was solid black!  I could not see a shape or form of anything in the sky- it was like it was blacked out on purpose!  I could hear no sound.  I could not hear any sounds from the nearby highway- I could hear no local animals (horses-dogs-crickets etc\u2026) there was literally NO NOISE- even the naturally occurring country noises outside.  It was still as ever!  The beams of light would rapidly change position- following no obvious pattern.  I walked the entire distance of my deck (60 feet) back and forth trying to make sense of what I was seeing- and to try and figure out what I was looking at.  I was home alone with the dog and did not have the courage to walk down onto my property and out into the field directly behind my home.  I unfortunately did not have my phone or a camera with me. As I watched the lights- I tried to make out whether they were coming from above or from the ground- and to be perfectly honest- I couldn\u2019t really tell.  I just noticed that the lights were very strong and vivid and much like a spotlight that you would see in the sky for a Hollywood premier- the lights had a bit of an orange and hazy sort of sparkly  tint to them- and were sometimes moving so rapidly that I couldn\u2019t tell where they were stopping and starting.  From what I could tell- there were no farmers out doing any crop work- as there was no machinery noise like you would hear during harvest time- plus they rarely harvest in the dark of night.  There are no homes due north of my house- only farming fields.  There are no trials for   hiking or four wheelers back there.  There should have been nothing there at all! I watched this light show for approx ten minutes and then became scared and went indoors.  After about ten more minutes I looked out my back window and all of the lights were gone!  There was also no more mist or fog in the air.  It was just clear night sky.",

      "story": "I saw a small blue light move from a star to the left, then it blinked out. On March 12, 2014, about 23:21 hours, I was standing outside my home, smoking a cigarette.   I looked to the West and just above my roof line I saw 3 stars in a line, (that I always see early in the night and to the west) but near the lowest star on the horizon out of these 3 stars, there was a small blue light.   I immediately focused in on it, because it was blue and it was moving.  I watched this blue light travel from (it almost looked like it was behind the star) the star to the left and at about a 40-45 degree angle towards the ground.   It traveled quickly for a few seconds, then it blinked out, and it was gone.  I thought I might have lost sight of it because of the tree branches that are in the way, but after getting a better view of that piece of sky, I could no longer see it.   I took out my iPhone 4S and took a picture of the sky where it was, but unless you turn up the brightness the image is almost all black.   This morning I remarked a copy of that p! icture, this morning.  I have used MSPaint to draw the path of the UFO, the tree branches, the roof line, and the brightest stars that were visible with the naked eye.  I will send the remarked picture and the original with this report.  Granted this was not a spectacular UFO sighting, but it was strange to me because I live in the flight path of a few airports, DFW International Airport, Love Field, Alliance Airport, and Arlington Municipal Airport.  So I am very familiar with Airplanes in the sky and the paths they take over my home, (it's usually from North to South) and this UFO was not taking a normal path that I see other Airplanes take.",

      "story": "Triangular Craft moving at high speeds- changing elevation several times- Orange perimiter lights- Red glowing/pulsing light in middle At 3 am this morning I was outdoors with my dog- and while sky watching I noticed a triangular shaped object moving rapidly from west to east as I looked at the northern sky.  I would describe it as a rather large triangle with a number of orange lights on the  entire perimeter and a larger more intense red light directly in the middle.   The middle red light appeared to be pulsing somewhat as it faded slowly in and out- the orange perimiter lights remained constant.   The speed of this craft was impressive and covered the entire expanse of my northern view from the west hemisphere all the way to the visible east hemisphere.  It moved in a rather erratic manner and changed elevation several times as it moved.   I would say that the height of the craft was lower than an Air Force Jet would fly- yet higher than a smaller personal aircraft (such as a two to four seater).  There were very clear conditions this morning- and I could clearly see the stars and planets.   The craft was illuminated brightly and would have been hard for anyone to miss!  My rural home is approx 15 miles north of Madison WI.  There is an Air Force base at Truax Field in Madison.   I noticed a number of Air Force jets patrolling this area within 5 to 10 minutes of my sighting!  They covered the area for about a half an hour traveling the same approximate route (back and forth) as the craft I witnessed.  It was a stunning sighting for me!   I keep my eyes skyward at night- and this was the most impressive thing I have witnessed over the past few years!",

Clear sky; normal air traffic around DFW for this time of day (roughly 30% chance of an air traffic within view), and normal number of stars. Atmospheric conditions allowed me to hear airplanes and cars as normal. Six objects in a loose formation of three pairs traveling at a constant height from SSE to ENE over Arlington TX.   Bright Orange/Red spheres, whose formation changed predictively in relation to my perspective as they flew by.  My view of this sky segment is 25% blocked by trees. Their size, apparent speed, and height reminded me of a formation of military helicopters, which most often travel down the I-30 corridor, as I see these several times a year, both day and night.  This flight appeared 2-3 miles South of I-30.  The two distinctions that differed these from a normal helicopter formation were a complete lack of noise, and their light output. These aircraft were silent, and luckily during my viewing there was no competing airplane noise.  To extrapolate their apparent size and speed to a distance where a normal helicopter could not be heard, would place them near the border of believability. The light output of these objects is, in my opinion, what sets them apart from anything in my experience.  They were not pin points, but were circular and by changing perspective, had volume.  Although orange/red, the brightness was only a little less than if a spotlight were pointed in my direction.  The intensity seen, varied only with distance, it was steady and uniform from all 6 objects.  They were too bright to make out helicopter rotors or tail booms. I have seen two fireballs in the sky in the past, one red, the other yellow green, both lasted around 10 seconds and I read about them the following day.  Last night the objects I saw lasted much longer.",

I was traveling south.   One block south of me and traveling north toward me, a dark grey and black saucer-shaped craft topped the hill.  It was as wide as the three lanes of traffic and had two red triangular lights on either side in a similar position to where the parking lights are on an automobile but on the bottom edge.  However, no light from these reflected onto the ground and they were not bright like headlights, but they were large rectangles and most definitely red.   The largest part of the craft was very dark gray and the top \u201cbubble\u201d part was black.  This craft was only a few inches off the roadway.  My light changed and as I proceeded toward it, it was as if something came between us and it was no longer visible.  As there was nothing there to actually come between us, I feel as if it \u201ccloaked! \u201d itself, but it was gone.  This area is very well lit as there are street lights on either side and there are businesses on both sides of the road so my visibility was excellent.  At this time of morning, there was no one else on the road except for it and me.  This road runs directly behind my house and this happened 1/2 block north from my backyard.  I went home and immediately called my friend who I had just dropped off and told her about it.  However, over a period of 20 minutes, we were only able to maintain a phone connection for about 5 minutes, as our call would get dropped and I would get the message \u201cCall Failed\u201d which never comes through when a call is dropped but rather when it doesn\u2019t go through to begin with.  I would try to call her back and it would do absolutely nothing.  Just like dead air.   She left me a voicemail message but my phone had not rang.  She would call me and get the same nothing.  One time, I called her and as the phone was ringing, it soun! ded as if there was a third party on the line and I could hear! some sc ratching like claws on a piece of wood but just when the call should have gone to voicemail, it just disconnected and I got the \u201cCall Failed\u201d message.  She said when we finally were able to talk that she had never experienced anything like that ever before with a cell phone.  I hadn\u2019t either.  I was unable to go to sleep until about 6:00 a.m.  The next day she told me that she had checked the Arlington Police Dept. active police \u201cblotter\u201d after we hung up and that from 3:00 a.m. until 3:30 a.m. there had been 9 calls to 911 that were only classified as \u201cdisturbances\u201d within a 1-mile radius of where this occurred and my house.  She tried to take a screen shot of this information, but it would not work.  I can get a copy of that night\u2019s activity from the police department, but cannot do so for 30 days.  At that time, I will forward you a copy of that to go with this report.",

It wasn't a reflection off the windshield, I tried to recreate it just in case and couldn't.  It wasn't a commercial jet, I see those all the time, it wasn't a satellite, I see them too.  I cant explain what that was.  I tried to scan the area afterwards to see if I could detect any movement without lights but I didn't see anything.",

Half of it went West and the other half moved East and disintegrated.   At that moment I thought it was pretty cool that I saw a shooting star, but then thought I never seen a shooting star explode like that.   I then proceeded to look up at the sky and about a minute after I saw the explosion, I looked up and saw what looked like a very big star.  I would say it was comparable to the size of the North Star.  The Star got bigger and then started to ascend upward and disappeared.   Now I am an educated man and have seen dozens of shooting stars but never saw a shooting star explode and then see object in the sky move closer to Earth and then ascend upward and out of our atmosphere.

      "story": "I clearly witnessed a UFO sighting for 12+ seconds on the Columbia River near Arlington, OR on 02/19/15. On Thursday, February 19, 2015 I was driving from Kennewick, WA to Vancouver, WA on the Oregon Interstate 84 West that runs along the Columbia River.  At 11:55 a.m., I was approximately 1/4 mile from the green Gilliam Co. road sign.  The weather was clear with some sun and high white and dark rolling clouds. A train came up along side of me on the raised tracks to the north of the Interstate.  On the north side of the train track, setting lower, is the Columbia River bed and river.  I looked over at the train as it passed me, wondering how fast it was traveling as I was driving approximately 68-69 m.p.h..  I noticed the back few train cars were flat trailers, faded pinkish in color, with some flat product wrapped in white and bright yellow plastic, and a little bit of the plastic was flapping in the wind.  I did not notice any other cars around me on the Interstate at the time. As the train got approximately three car lengths ahead of me, I heard a very loud rumble. The sound was not like a train track sound, but more like a very close jet rumble.  I had my two front car windows, and my back passenger window, down approximately 3\" each, because of the outside mild temperatures.  I was shocked by the sound and was trying to figure out why I was hearing, what I thought must have been the train sound, even though I knew it sounded odd, after it had already passed me. I glanced back at the train to the left and caught something out of the corner of my eye to the right that made a downward fishhook motion from above the river water, as if it had descended and leveled.  I looked directly out my passenger window and parallel with me was a small domed craft, what appeared to be hovering, but it also stayed parallel with me as I continued to drive.  It was approximately 10-15 feet above the Columbia River water, well below the Interstate and train track.  There were no boats in the water and this was an obvious aircraft with an obvious shape, above the water.   I glanced back again at the last train car that was now ahead of me on the track and back to the craft for size comparison, and the craft appeared to be slightly larger than half a train car. The craft shape was slightly domed on top and was symmetrical. It appeared to be directly facing me as it stayed parallel with me.  On the end of the dome, on the left and right, were small extensions that looked like downward wing tips.   The underbelly was slightly domed, but not as much as the top part.  In the center of the side wall facing me, was a smooth small protruding cone, or rounded tip of some kind, with a perfect black circle on the end.  Above this cone, was a shape that resembled a bell dome, or what came to mind at the time was the shape of a WWII German soldier hard hat, with a slight curl on the end and small brim at the top.  The center of the bell looked flat, which looked like a cockpit window of sorts, but there was no glass reflection or difference in color from the rest of the craft.  The overall color was a dry flat blended, almost swirled, grayish green, very similar in color to that of the river, but the river was shiny and glossy, and this was an obviou! s flat color, and again, obviously shaped and raised above the water. This entire event was only a matter of seconds, approximately 12, but felt slow motion at the same time as I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The craft, while appearing to stay even with me while I continued to drive, and the train out of immediate view now, made a 1/4 slow even circular turn to the right and paused for a second.  As it did this, I did not see the profile of the cone or brim that was on the front. It appeared a smooth, almost fluid, transition.  There were no shapes or markings on this side, only the same grayish green color.  The craft then very quickly made a 3/4 right turn, bringing it full circle, and it shot upward, heading northwest toward the Washington side of the Columbia River, in a steep, just slightly angled, climb, well above the mountain on the Washington side of the river.  As it made its final turn before heading upward, I heard a loud brief swoosh sound. The craft appeared to turn black once it moved away from the water. In a matter of 2-3 seconds, it disappeared in to the white rolling clouds above.  There were no visible lights on the craft, no jet trail, no heat or fume waves visible.  Nothing. I drove to the next small town of Arlington, OR, and pulled in to their park.  My heart was racing and I felt nauseous.  I think I was in shock from what I had just seen.   I texted my immediate family members and told them what had happened at 12:20 p.m.  At 1:17 p.m., I sketched a picture of what I saw. To my credibility, I am a ((50's)) year old mother, and grandmother who holds a ((deleted)) Degree in ((deleted--arts and sciences)), and two ((deleted)) Degrees with ((deleted--honors)).  I have never experienced anything like this before, but I can not refute what I saw today.",

On June 6, 2015, at 10:00 PM, in Arlington, WA, I got out of my car to pump some gas at the Safeway gas pumps in Smokey Point.  As I turned north to walk behind my car, I saw several orange lights jump up into the sky very quickly, one after another.  Each one popped up within a second or less after the one before it.  I have photos of ten of them, but I think there was an 11th one that is not in the photo.  It seemed like there was a straggler. They stayed somewhat low above the horizon for about 30 seconds.  (You can get a good idea of this in the photos.)  I took a total of ten photos while they were in sight.  Then they suddenly turned to the east, (they had been heading south towards me, and I was slightly to the west of them) and flew out of sight pretty quickly.  There was no sound from them the entire time. These lights were much brighter and bigger than any star and much smaller than the Moon. You can get a sense of this in the photos.  I did not see any flashing lights, just steady, orange lights moving across the sky.  They did not have any of the lights that a typical airplane would have. I did consider the possibility that they could be Chinese lanterns.  However, they moved much too quickly and with too much control for that to be the case.  In my location, I wondered if they had taken off from the Arlington Airport, which is not a manned airport (it has automated landing).  That could have been approximately where they took off from, because they looked reasonably close.  However, they could also have taken off further north than that.  The lights were bright enough to be seen from a good distance. There was not a noticeable wind in the area at the time I saw this.  I think Chinese lanterns would have stayed around much longer, even if there had been a strong wind. When I expand the one photo of three lights, I can see the orange glow.  It\u2019s not real clear.  I took the photos with my iPhone. However, you can get a sense of the color.

This formation appeared to be approx the width of a football field. It looked like 30-40 spotlights pointed straight upward toward the sky.   The lights were green with a bit of orange- but mostly green.  I could not see a source of the lights, and they were over an area of farm fields.   There were no tractors in the fields and there are also no homes or buildings in this area.   The light formation did move slightly to the west at the ten minute mark.  I counted approx 20 Air Force jets circling in the sky during the event.  This is highly unusual, as I normally see no more than a handful at a time in the skies around my home.  At the fifteen minute point the lights completely disappeared.",

I was noticing the stars and that one in the clear western sky looked \"odd\".  I kept looking at it and noticed it appeared to be not one light, but multiple lights, at least 3 lights and perhaps 4.  All together they were in the shape of a perfect triangle, with the point toward us consisting of perhaps 2 lights close together.  The lights were colored yellowish.  The UFO was approximately due west from us, elevated approx. 40 degrees up from the horizon.  My best guess is that its altitude was perhaps 3500-5000 feet above ground, and maybe 4 miles from our position. \"It\" seemed to appear to be moving very very slowly to the east, almost as if in a slow moving hover.  No sound could be discerned from it. We could see only lights. My wife took some pics with her cell phone but they just show a faint blur (pixelated) area.   After about 5 minutes of looking, we went back to our apartment to get my monocular, binoculars, camera, and to make a quick report on Facebook, in the hopes that others saw it too.  That took about 3-4 minutes, then we went back outside to the place we had observed the UFO.  We could not locate the UFO again and noted that the sky appeared to be hazy now and clouding up some.

I looked out my bedroom window at around 10:30 PM Friday, May 26th, 2017, to see a large series of lights rotating counter clockwise.  It appeared as though the lights were forming a very large circular craft.  There appeared to be a secondary craft about half the size of the first rotating in the opposite direction than the original series of lights and hovering adjacent.  I ruled out search lights as the sky was very cloudy, and no streaks of lights indicating a ground level light were seen, just large pull shaped lights slowly circling.  There was no sound to be heard.   The phenomenon lasted an hour and a half after I had originally seen it through my window, there is no telling whether or not it had started earlier.   At 12:00 midnight I returned to the window to check on the position of the lights and they had completely disappeared without a trace.   Another thing worth nothing: during the time that the lights were visible, three conventional aircrafts were heard.  I heard one helicopter, and two planes.  I live close to Logan Airport, commercial flights are very common to see and hear, but the two planes sounded distinctly louder and were only breifly heard.  The lights remained well after the conventional aircrafts had left earshot.",

I witnessed a disc shaped craft   black in color matte/ metallic about twenty feet wide it had some type of lettering on the lower half of the object.  The craft seemed to be emitting a field which may have been the cause of me being as if not able to move. There was a feeling of communication through thought with my inner voice.  This was to and from the disc craft.  It moved after I came out of the state of being entranced.  Then I moved as I began to search for it in the surrounding sky I watched it move slowly away then when I pointed at it moved away horizontally and with immense speed far away as the eye could spot it and then up as if it went to space. The craft was I think somehow emitting a field that I could sense like small waves that were so intense.  As if I could almost see a ripple or an aura that seemed to be what was paralyzing me and then I felt like I should think what I wanted to communicate so I said through my mind to it, why do you not intervene to improve our world? I sensed a voice answering because of all the warring.\t I was riding a bicycle on the fish creek trail in Arlington, Texas and stopped along the trail happened to be looking up when I saw a black saucer shaped craft. It hovered   about twenty feet above the ground It was an area with trees and a creek there was a clear area about 40 feet wide where it was clear of trees. Upon noticing the flying craft I was completely consumed with awe and shock it took all my attention away from my two children who did not look up to see the craft because I could not even move my attention from the object.  They sat facing me under the shade of a tree that was to the right and slightly forward of the object.  The tree was thick with leaves so they did not see or look up at it.  When my son yelled to get my attention is when I realized that he had been calling me for about a minute already. \u201cHe shouted Dad what are you looking at you are scaring me.\u201d  That is when I broke my stare of the object to turn to him as I looked up again the object moved. When I moved to where my children were I looked up to notice the tree was not allowing for them to get a view of the craft so they followed me as I moved over to where I looked around for where it had moved to.  Then I spotted it again as I was looking at it this time it seemed to be about two hundred feet away 100 feet high moving south it had a blue color hue on the back.  As I pointed to it to show my son where it was the craft sped away without making a sound.  It was so fast that before my finger was able to point at it the thing seemed to leave the atmosphere.

Although this happened a few years back, I am curious to know if anyone has seen the same thing I did. Driving down a regular, pretty nice, suburban street at night in Arlington, me and my bestfriend we\u2019re headed towards the end of a street where you could either go left or right when you got the the stop sign.  You can not go straight.  (We needed to go left). As we were coming down the same street we always did, a 8 ft tall \u201cthing\u201d walked across the street, at the stop sign of the neighborhood which we were driving towards.  It was similar shaped to a human, but way taller and way skinnier, overall tall and lanky to the point where there was no mistaking the fact that it was not human.  It\u2019s head was slimmer than a human too, clearly not as big as a human head would be to a body of this size.  The arms went further down then a humans would.  It walked across the street like it was somewhat in a hurry. My heart dropped instantly and I couldn\u2019t really even say anything.  I could not believe what I know I had for sure seen just casually, somewhat in a rush, cross the street. My bestfriend spoke about 2seconds after it happened, (she was driving the car) and said, \u201cdid you just see that\u201d  I said \u201cYES\u201d she replied, \u201cwell tell me what you saw so I know you\u2019re not lying.\u201d \u201cIt was y\u2019all and skinny\u201d.  She started laughing and continued driving down the street as I yelled at her to stop because I thought it would jump on the car or something like a horror movie. Instead, it must have his because it was nowhere in sight.  But if I were it in a human world, I would probably hide too. There is one video on YouTube of an alien on a roof top in Mexico in 2015. That is the only pic/video I have found of EXACTLY the thing that I saw.  I know that video is real, because I saw that thing with my own eyes.  I think he is stuck on Earth, maybe that\u2019s why it took him 3 yrs to end up on a roof top in Mexico because he is having to walk around at night to try to stay out of sight somewhat.  Not really sure.",
