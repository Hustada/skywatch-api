It was about the height of helicopters flying around when there's news and chases and things of that nature. It made a weird \"hoovering?\" sound, its hard to explain really. We were all really surprised as it was flying relatively low. The skies were really clear and we only saw it for about 10 seconds just to where we were able to see it as the light were really dim and could not see it that far after it passed. This has been my very first sighting and I am very intrigued by what it could be.

      "story": "Large fiery orange object seemed to come apart then turned and climbed in altitude and speed. On Friday, October 30th at around 10:20PM I was on my balcony smoking a cigarette when I noticed a very large light moving from the North-West to the South-East. What got my attention is that the light was larger than the normal flight traffic you get here between LAX and John Wayne airports. It was a deep orange color, no wing tip lights or other normal blinking marker lights. I watched for more than 5 minutes as it approached my location growing bigger, before I called to my son. My 19yo son commented that this was very definitely not our normal passenger air traffic, and that is very unsettling.  A few moments later the light made a turn to our left and headed do west out over the Pacific Ocean and gained altitude. Just at this moment it seemed to break apart or drip debris. Looked very much like burning embers falling from the object and fading as the fell. Both my son and I felt that this must have been a burning aircraft up until it turned and gained altitude as it headed out to sea.  We see a tremendous amount of air traffic (civilian and military) here as well as occasional launches from Vandenberg AFB. This was very definitely not either! Too big to be aircraft and missile launches generally produce a very white light. Waited to report until today as we assumed we would hear about it in the news today.  Last night was an almost full moon and exceedingly clear cloudless night. The altitudes and speeds  seemed consistent with general aviation, although the size and orange color were inconsistent as well as the turn towards the pacific and the debris falling. Total viewing time 10-12 minutes.",

This is probably going to sound crazy, but I can\u2019t explain what I saw tonight.  My husband saw it too, he thinks it was just a plane, but he can\u2019t explain how the lights possibly looked if they were a plane. We went to Disneyland tonight.  We got off the Nightmare before Christmas ride and were walking back towards the lake when I saw 3 multicolored lights in the sky over the lake in triangular formation.  Disney normally has this light show over the lake, where they project lights and movies onto water fountains that shoot out of the lake.  I though the lights were something for the show, and I pointed them out to my husband and told him I wanted to see what they were doing for the light show. As we walked, the lights were moving slowly upwards.  I still thought they had to do with the show, until we got over next to the lake and no one was there because there was no light show.  We could still see the triangular formation moving up and to the right.  I asked my husband what it was, and he said it had to be a plane.  But the lights did not stay in one formation, they changed places.  I could tell because each one was a different color, and they switched as they moved. I kept telling my husband to look, and asking him what he thought it was, but he couldn\u2019t answer.  He said it was a plane, then that it was too foggy to tell, but I know what I saw. The lights moved up and to the right, and finally, and turned to look at my husband and when I looked back they were gone.  I\u2019ve thought it over 100 times, and I don\u2019t know what it was. They did not move in a straight line, they changed formation, they were much closer to the park when I saw them than when they disappeared.  Even if there had been a light show it couldn\u2019t have explained this.   I know it sounds completely crazy to say you saw a UFO at Disneyland, but I have no explanation for what I saw. I have photos, but they are long exposures and not very good, but you can see in the few shots that they are getting dimmer.  I could see them for probably about 2-3 minutes.",

      "story": "Flying Saucer Seen Cruising Over I-5 Near Anaheim Late at Night A low-flying aircraft of a round, saucer-like shape was seen flying north alongside the I-5 south in Anaheim after midnight on Tuesday night as I was driving home to San Diego from Los Angeles. My peripheral vision picked up a low-flying airplane above the freeway, which caught my interest. As I looked to examine it, I noticed it was not an airplane but a darkly-colored (black or dark grey) saucer-shaped object that was moving at what seemed to be a low speed and at what seemed to be a low altitude. It was difficult to tell, as my car was moving past it at 70 mph in the opposite direction, but the craft appeared to be travelling somewhere between 40-70 mph, going north, and only a few hundred feet off the ground.  This would have made the object itself a bit smaller than an airplane, although it is too difficult to estimate a size. What was then even more interesting was a blue light that emitted from the side wall of the craft, moving in a circle around the ! craft, looking a bit like a reflection from a glass wall, but perhaps coming from within the craft. It was then that I really thought I'd seen a U.F.O. I had never seen one before, and I still have my doubts about this one.  The craft was spotted in a densely populated urban area, not far from Disneyland and many other world-famous entertainment spectacles, and it may simply have been coming from or going to one of those places.  But for the five seconds I had to witness it, the craft truly did not look human to me. Many more people saw the object I'm sure, and so I made this report to see if anyone else who saw it also was taken aback by its curiosities.",

      "story": "UFO over Anaheim CA, near midnight, circular with blue lights. Investigated by mysterous helicopter. About 23:45 hours on above date I recieved a call from a family member.  The family member was hysterical about a supposed UFO near our location.  This family member indicated that there was a UFO hovering over a major hotel in the area, that dozens of people had pulled over to watch it and that it showed no sign of leaving.  Myself and two other family members quickly got into a vehicle and drove to the location they were at.  While we were in transit, we saw a strange helicopter approach the area and alternatingly hover and search. This helicopter had the apparent length of a CH-47 military helicopter, but was unidentifiable due to lack of lighting.  It had none of the regular blinking red lights, but had alternatingly green, orange, and blue bright lights flashing in a regular pattern.  It appeared to have some sort of attached storage device under it, cube or rectangular shaped. The light configuration and storage construct was unlike anything I had seen before.  The altitude of the helicopter was about 75 meters.  The helicopter was there from about the time I recieved the call (possibly earlier) and bugged out at approx. 0010 hours in a N/NW direction. We approached the location my family member gave me and parked alongside 9 other vehicles, each with 2-5 people in them all looking in the same direction.  We personally were unable to see the UFO as it left minutes before we arrived.  We stayed for about 45 minutes and it did not reappear. The family member that called me took video on her cellphone and upon getting home, we loooked online and there was already one other video of the event posted. On a perhaps unrelated note, a cell phone in the house at 2232 hours experienced service interruption and emitted an electronic tone I have never heard before.  The tone sounded like the hybrid tone of a dial up phone, but without the tempo or form associated with that normal tone. The cell phone video my family member took is available if needed.

      "story": "Low flying, triangular shaped, series of dimly lit orange lights Six (6) dimly lit, orange lights in the formation of a triangle made up the object. Three (3) lights making up the outer corners of the triangle were accompanied by three (3) more lights, making a smaller triangle in the middle of the first. (Refer to the corners of a \"triforce\" to better grasp this concept.) It appeared that all the lights were connected to the same craft, as opposed to the lights being their each individual entities, because as the object moved through the sky, the lights remained equidistant to each other. he rest of the craft, aside from the lights, was a dense dark shade of black. The only way it was possible to make out the shape of the craft, was seeing how it blocked out the stars as it passed through the sky. Besides that, the craft was relatively invisible in contrast with the black sky. It flew through the area quite low, such as if you were in the proximity of an airport with the planes flying over you to land. The biggest shock of all, when comparing this object to a low flying aircraft, was the absolute absence of any and all noise. No engine noise, no sonic boom. The craft moved in pure silence. The object passed through the sky heading heading Westbound. We first saw the object in the horizon of the Eastern sky, towards Yorba Linda.  We watched it come straight towards us, and just as it had nearly reached our location, it began to alter it's course. It bent to it's ride side and headed North-West towards Fullerton.  The time it took for it to get from the Eastern horizon, across the sky, and out of sight to the North-West was about 20 seconds.",

He turned to me and told me to look at it to make sure he was really seeing what we both believe to be a UFO. It was traveling at a steady pace at about 70-80 miles per hour at about 1/4 to 1/2 mile up. It was very clearly a triangle shape and had very define points to it. We were both very baffled as to how something that shape could be flying in the night sky. The sky was free from and clouds and it was very clear out. As it passed by it blocked the view of the stars so we knew we were looking as a solid object. It was a very surreal feeling to be looking at this object. It kind of scared me a bit as well. Being a very logical person I was going through things it might be in my head as I was analyzing it as it flew over. There was nothing that I could logically say it resembled that I have ever ! seen and I have seen many tv programs in military aircrafts and prototypes and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen in my life. I would say the size would be in proportion with a 747 jet. It had 3 very dim square light at each triangle point. The lights were a white glow similar to a florescent bulb and they were casting a glow in between each light showing the triangle shape. As it flew over we noticed that there was no sound what so ever and as it passed us we could see the back of it as it glided over us. It was perfectly flying it a straight line and parallel to the sky. It never pivoted of veered off course. After it passed by we got a very good view of the back of the craft. It was a flat dark surface about 15 to 20 ft high. We continued to watch it until it was out of sight. I have to say that was a very eerie feeling and I will never forget what I saw that night.",

The UFO was seen in the evening at Sleeping Beauty's Castle during the end of the night fireworks show.  During the middle of the fireworks show, my family and I, along with the hundreds of people at Disney, noticed a shape approaching the castle coming from the West.  The shape became evident that it was in the shape of a saucer as it flew closer to the castle.  Hundreds of eye witnesses and myself became very quiet as it flew over us.  My best guess is it was maybe 500 ft above us as we could all see it was silver, metallic and it had a series of lights on the underside of the craft that spiraled in a counter-clockwise direction.  The craft never made a sound as it flew over us.  The flight pattern was smooth and linear.  The craft never stopped.  It continued to fly through the fireworks, over the castle and onto the horizon. I tried to video tape! it with my little digital camera; however, all you could see was the lights swirling in the counter-clockwise direction and could not quite make out the shape of the craft because it was too dark.  I remember listening to a bunch of the surrounding people whispering and asking if that was a UFO as it approached the castle.  There is no doubt in my mind that what we saw was not an airplane, helicopter or any other flying craft we typically see in the sky.",

Peter,  I just caught the end of your interview on coast to coast last night but I have herd you before. My question is do you have any interest in old reports?   I had an encounter in 1963 with my brother and the next door neighbor, I was eight at the time but still remember it rather well.   I also have a sighting five years ago with two disk and I know a man locally with a sighting. The one with the local man here is interesting to me anyway, he is now into refrigeration repair on businesses.  This story was told to me while we were having lunch together and we got to talking about jobs we had.  He had a small aircraft parts delivery business and mentioned he was a security officer at Malstrom AFB just north of us here in Great Falls Montana when he got out of High School.   The interesting part was I asked him about his time there and one thing lead to another.  His job was to watch over the nukes, he was called out to investigate a alarm.  When he showed up with his partner they noticed a glowing 10 foot diameter object over the concrete top on the missile.  They watched it for 20 minutes when it moved toward town, he said they could keep up with it till it got to the other side of town.  He them radioed in and two jets were sent and he could still see the craft when the jets went bye with after burners on.  He was later told to be quite about it but was told ! the craft was clocked at 4000 MPH when lost over Belt Montana.  He is a rather religious guy and when I asked him if he thought there were alien he said that stuff is B.S.  He did tell me he thought they were Russian crafts because this happen in the 1970's and the Russian's were watching us.  ((name deleted))",

When it stopped it went dark, although still kind of shimmering.  We could see the shape of this sphere like little flecks of 'fireflies' barely visible.  We looked around the sky and noticed about 10 other of these spheres lined up in a line right above it looking the same.

They both were travelling from west to east about 80 mph fast, straight and horizontal about 300 feet up.  They were travelling parallel to Katella Ave from about Beach Blvd. vicinity when I first noticed.   I ran and got my binoculars and watched as they passed in front of me.  The copter was close to it, maybe 75 feet behind and slightly above it about 30 degrees.  I could see the copter.  I could see the orb light, there was not a craft attached to it,  just a bright sphere of light.  The orb appeared to be no larger than the cockpit of the copter.

There were many helicopters heard that night, but I did not see any more strange flying lights.  This orb was self-illuminated and looked like a flying ball of light, not like an aircraft with a fuselage of any sort.",

On Saturday September 13, 2014, at 11:15 PM on the 1500 block of West Embassy Street in Anaheim California 92802 (the cross street is Loara 1 block south of Lincoln Avenue).   I observed the following:  In the middle of the street (Embassy Avenue) I saw an egg shaped object floating 2-3 feet off the ground.  The object was about 2 \u00bd feet across and it was approximately 20 feet away from me.  It was a dark blue like an India ink blue and it blended into the night and the black asphalt.  The only illumination was from a street light.  I first thought it might have been a helium balloon that had drifted from Disneyland.  Disneyland is about 2 miles away and sometimes helium balloons float away and they land in the area.  Upon close inspection it had no string attached to it and it stayed in the same position.  It never touched the ground. As I approached the object I could see that the \u201cballoon\u201d had a thin semi-transparent membrane covering it.  Inside the object I could see a faint rose/pink colored light that was the size of a football and the light slowly pulsated.  It was a faint light.  Not bright.  And it was inside the object.  The object was smooth and it looked like latex.  Not metallic.  It had no antenna, fins nor propeller.  And it had no exterior lights. As I walked towards the object it remained in place about 3 feet off the ground.  My first impression was that it may be a balloon, drone or remote controlled object.  But it made no sound.  The object was totally silent.  It seemed peaceful and tranquil.  Not threatening. As I walked toward it (I did not run or make any fast moves), I thought I would try to capture it but when I got within about 2 feet from the object it slowly rose out of my reach straight up into the night sky.  It banked to the north and went over the buildings across the street and out of sight.  Its motion was smooth and not fast.  I never touched it. I did not experience any adverse reaction from it.  In fact it seemed inviting and almost playful.  I regret I did not have a camera with me to photograph it.   I was alone and no one else to my knowledge saw the object.",

On 09/16/2014, at 14:24 local time, in Anaheim, California, I had gone out onto my 2nd floor apartment balcony.  Just after exiting the front entry door, I looked up to check for any wasp nests under the overhang from the roofline edge. At that moment, I immediately noticed an object hovering in the clear open sky, past the roof of the apartments, opposite my own.  The object shape was sort of fuzzy and hard to make out, but it was silent, and flashed 3 red lights, then 3 white lights.  The object looked close enough to have made a sound, if it had been a helicopter.   The object very slowly floated off to my right (in an Easterly direction), and got gradually farther away, but I could still clearly see the alternating lights flashing, red then white, red then white...    After about one minute of watching the object, a dragonfly insect flew close to where I stood on my balcony, and for a brief second distracted me from the object.  When I looked back at where the object should have been, there was no lights or sign of the ufo anymore - as if it had 'blinked off' or simply just vanished.   I watched the sky for half a minute more, but there was nothing at all to seen in the blue, above me.",

      "story": "My wife and I saw what by all appearances was a UFO at Disneyland on the night of June 4th 2015. My wife and I were at Disneyland on the night of June 4th 2015.  We were sitting on a low railing around a planter, waiting for the 11:00 pm light parade to start.  It was approximately 10:45 pm.  We were directly in front of the \"Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln\" building, facing west toward the circle that is the beginning of Main Street.  A man sitting to my right on the same railing got my attention by saying to me (while he was looking to the sky directly above the circle), \"Are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing, or am I going crazy?\"   I followed his line of sight and observed what I at first glance appeared to be a giant dark smoke ring at cloud level (approximately 2000 feet).  I answered him, and said, \"No, you're not crazy I see it.\"   I then said, \"What is that?\"  He then said (as neither one of us took our eyes off of the object), \"I don't know, that's what I'm trying to figure out.\"  At that time, my wife (sitting to my left on the same railing ) said to me what are you looking at, looked in the same direction and observed the same thing, she then asked me what it was. I told her I did not know.  Clearly this was not a smoke ring of any kind because by this time (by which a couple of minutes had passed), if it had been a smoke ring, it would have dissipated.   Upon further observation, this was an object partially obscured by being at just the bottom level of the cloud layer.  As if it were using the clouds to camouflage itself.  This object appeared to have a slight oval shape.  And I would approximate it to be (at being 2000 feet above us) about 300 yards long and 250 yards wide.  As we watched it began very slowly move due north (towards Cinderella's castle ).  I would estimate its speed at no more the 30 mph.  The object traveled a distance equivalent of about six times its length and slowly disappeared upwards at that point, the clouds around it envelopeing it until it was out of sight.   I remember as the object moved slowly through the clouds you could see the clouds billowing around the leading edge of the object.  It emitted no sound that I could detect and hid so well in the clouds that you could only see its dark silhouette, the front of the object having a darker appearance than the rest of the  silhouette, giving it an almost transparent appearance.  At about the same time the object started moving, my wife and I stood up and walked five feet forward to the curb of the street to get a better look at the object, and we remained there till it was gone from sight.  I did not get the other man's phone number as I should have, but after I acknowledged that I did see the object he showed no interest in talking about what we had seen, and when the parade was over, he walked away into the crowd of people.  So unless someone else happened to see this and comes forward with what they saw, it's just the corroboration of my wife and me, and we will not deny what we saw.   I did take photos of the object that are difficult to make out because you are looking at an object obscured by clouds at night.  Although in one of the shots you can make out the leading and trailing edges of the craft.",

Was looking out of a hotel room towards Disneyland resort area and it was early dawn.  In the sky appeared a light that at first could have been a meteor but moved slowly in its trajectory and made a very long streak.  It became a little brighter and then faded out to nothing, similar to when a plane flies, turns towards you, and then turns away.   I do not know what I saw, but it seemed far too slow moving for a shooting star/meteor.   It also was the date that debris was reported to be crashing to earth, but I did not read anywhere that this would have been visible over Anaheim, California.",

We were outside of a ride waiting in line when I looked up at the sky to see the stars.  I saw what appeared to be a satellite.  It was headed south/southwest and was a reddish orange color.   My friend and I both watched it for a minute or so before it began to act unusual.  It began to zigzag and speed up and slow down.  It even stopped and started at one point.   At this point my friend looked away and the object stopped a second time.  It turned from a reddish-orange to yellow and let out a sky blue beam out into the night sky on its left side and disappeared into the clouds. I cannot believe that my friend looked down at his phone just before it started to act like it was not a satellite but maybe other people saw it too.  Disneyland can be very crowded.",

We continued to watch them for about 4-5 minutes until they flew off into the distance away from the Orange County airport heading south about 20 miles inland from the coast.  The way these objects were flying, was almost as if they were birds playing in the sky, darting in and out and up and down and circling one another... not at all h! ow  commercial planes or helicopters would fly.

      "story": "Drone-like sphere follows airplane in clear afternoon sky, then veers slowly away, before vanishing. At my apartment complex, I had just walked out to toss trash in a dumpster, when I heard, and then saw, a Cessna model 172 flying in an Easterly direction, above the trees and housing area nearby.  The sky was blue, and without any clouds.  The Cessna flew at an altitude that suggested it would land at nearby Fullerton airport.  It was perhaps about one quarter mile south of my location. Just a moment after looking at the Cessna airplane, I noticed a mostly round shaped object, about one third the length of the Cessna in size, was flying just slightly higher and behind the Cessna plane.  The object was colored mainly white and black, and had a single and very bright white light near its top that flashed regularly, like a beacon or strobe. The object flew on at a slower speed than the Cessna, and I followed it for about one minute as it flew farther away and farther South than the track the Cessna had taken.  When the object was then just a tiny point in the clear sky, it suddenly just vanished.  I watched for another minute or so, but it never came back. The best thing I can compare the object to would be the flying \u2018drone balls\u2019 that are in the Tom Cruise Science-Fiction film called \u201cOblivion\u201d.  The object flew and looked much like those round drones in that movie, though I estimate it to have been much larger in size than those in the film were.  Maybe the size of a Smart Car or Fiat 500. I believe whatever this object was, that it was a remotely controlled vehicle.  Whether it was of an alien origin, or a secret military device, I can only speculate at this point.  But I can say that it is the second time I have seen a drone-like UFO flying in the vicinity of my apartment in Anaheim, seeing another one just last year, also in the afternoon daylight hours.   Lastly, I had the feeling it knew it was being observed.",

Good evening around 1845 on Thursday Oct 24 2019 my wife and I were driving Northbound toward Los Angeles on the 405. As we were passing through the town of Anaheim we noticed a unusual egg/oval shaped object that appeared to be floating then suddenly moving downward and upward erratically. I quickly pulled out my phone to try and capture what we were both witnessing. What we were seeing was approximately 100 yards off the highway and seemed to be above a parking garage by the looks of it. The color of the craft was grey in color with some shimmery texture to it. It appeared to be maybe 10-15 feet in height but was hard to tell as we were driving and it was moving frantically. I looked online on multiple sights and asked on multiple social media sites to see if anyone else that was around witnessed the same thing. I was able to get a decent 20-25 second video of the craft which I will attach. The first thing I thought of when I saw this was that it\u2019s a big balloon that usually car dealers put on the cars if they are having a big sale of some sort. But after getting closer and than witnessing the object quickly come down then go back up I realized it couldn\u2019t be a balloon cause they do not move that erratic or suddenly. Also there was no strings or anything attached to this thing. What I could tell this object was approximately 75-100 feet in the air. A little background on myself, I have noticed unusual objects flying since moving out here in California 4 years ago.  I\u2019m 28 years old and am a Marine Corps OEF combat veteran.  Served just over 5 years before coming out here.  After that I worked for the government as a contractor and was around aviation heavily so I have a strong deep understanding and knowledge of aviation and in general flying.  This sighting was for sure a bit off and it wasn't anything iv seen nor know of that would be able to maneuver the way this thing did. Hope this was detailed enough and I was able to shed some light on the issue.  Stay vigilant.",
