      "story": "large triangular craft  with 5 lights1 a red blinking light,hovering until i arrived right next to it and slowly dissappeared This event took place on April 21, 2008. My buddy was taking me home that night it was about 11:30 pm driving down highway 70 between Raleigh and Durham. And coming around the bend there is a straight shot of about 2 miles of road to the intersection of page rd. and highway 70, so as soon as we go around this bend I see two really bright lights all the way down at the intersection that were noticeably brighter than any of the other lights around the area. And immediately my friend says \u201cthat\u2019s a plane man\u201d and I automatically agreed with him thinking it has to be\u2026 no way you know? As we got about half way down the road we noticed it hasn\u2019t moved at all, so the next thing my friend says is that it has to be power line stand with lights or something and my reaction was were about to find out we are coming up on it now, we pass the power lines on the road which has no lights at all on it and then we pass about 300 feet of tall trees blocking the view and as we pulled up next to this craft immediately three other lights were now visible one of which was a blinking red light. It was a big black triangular object hovering completely stationary at least as long as 2 city buses together. It was only about 50 to 100 ft. over the trees, no sound completely silent no shine what so ever. I could see the angles of the craft through the light and could tell it was a three dimensional triangle about as tall as one story of a house. As soon as we stopped the car after taking a right on page rd. the craft started to move slowly away as if it had seen that we figured out what it was or as if there was some sort of intelligence looking back at us just steady slow cruising seemed to gain altitude and in a matter of seconds was totally gone, the lights we had seen two miles away had disappeared in a few seconds. See the thing is I got such a good look at this thing it is unbelievable, much less did I even believe in the phenomena but to be in the right place right time to even come in visual contact with one! blows m y mind. It looked like to me it was just sitting there watching the airport that has planes flying in and out all day but as it moved away I could tell that the blinking red light was on the back left corner cause of the direction of the leading point. I want to add that I have never been more scared in my life really my eyes were watering from shock I guess and I had goose bumps all over the place all night because of it. And other than that this is as far as I can go with it because its impossible to pursue further and half the people you actually tell your story to think you\u2019re out of your mind but I don\u2019t care we know exactly what we saw.And the reson i filled this out now i because it took my a while to be able to look at this site because of no internet.",

We both noticed in the distance a small black oval moving erratically over the highway. We had the same reaction 'What is that?'. It seemed to sway back and forth across the interstate.  As we continued travelling, it was briefly blocked by overhead road signs.  When it came back into view, it was slightly larger and still black in color.  Within about 30 seconds, it seemed to make a quick 90 degree turn towards the North and appeared much larger in shape... it was very bright as if was metallic and the sun was reflecting from it.  As soon as it made it's turn, it very rapidly 'swooshed' downwards and flew off towards the North at a very fast pace.  It moved so quickly, we lost sight of it as it flew behind the treeline.",

My husband and I were outside on our deck talking and we were amazed at how bright the stars were that night.

This is the best way to describe the color...I have never seen anything so bright in my life.  In fact it was so bright that I saw it coming behind the garage before we could actually see it.  I said what is that and then all the sudden we saw the fireball.  We live in a less poulated area so it is dark at night time.  It was the weirdest thing that I think I have ever felt and the coolest thing I have ever seen.  I kept saying did you see that?  Finally my husband said yes.  We just thought it was a weird metor or something.  We were kind of embarrased to tell anyone.  I am posting this because I was on the cnn site looking at the UFO thing that happened in Texas and came across other people that have seen green fireballs.  It kind of made me think I was not crazy after all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Stealth craft at night 2/19/2009     I have been working the graveyard shift for a couple of months and have been listening to the Coast to Coast Radio Network with George Noory and other hosts. On one of the recent shows they had a guest and were talking about unidentified flying craft using stealth or camouflaging technology to imitate star patterns and such. I think what I witnessed may be similar to this. I wish I could be more specific in the date but it was some time ago and only hearing the show caused this recollection.  It was during the summer months in central Connecticut between 1975 and 1978 as best as I can remember between 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. I was with a bunch of friends at local gathering place, away from city lights out in the country. We were just hanging out as we did on many summer nights. For some reason I looked up at the night sky at the stars, which were exceptionally bright, as there was no moon and no clouds. I was just gazing at the different constellations when I noticed something out of the ordinary. A sizeable section of the sky was blacked out. Then I realized this section of black out was moving if I remember right in an east to west direction. I don\u2019t recall if there was a noticeable shape to it, but you could see the stars disappearing behind it the reappearing as it passed. This did not have a false star pattern as some that were mentioned on the show just darkness. The only reason I saw it was due to the motion. If it were sitting still you would not have seen anything. I\u2019m not sure of the altitude with nothing to reference it to, but my gut feeling is that it was quite high not quite Airliner high but much higher than small Airplanes fly. It did not do any sudden or erratic moves just cruised across the sky. With out being sure of the altitude it would be hard to say how fast. Again my gut feeling was that this thing was big  if it was as high as an Airliner it was really big and moving faster than an Airliner. And I did not hear any noise no jet sounds, no helicopter sounds, or visible contrail. I am very familiar with what Airplanes, Helicopters and Blimps look like and sound like this was not any of those things. I do not know what it was. I don\u2019t know if this information is helpful or not, maybe it will correlate with something else that happened during that time. All I know is what I saw or didn\u2019t see in this case.

What I thought was strange is the movements made were very elusive only up, down, left, and right and even more it  never  sat still for long almost as if it knew it was being watched.

      "story": "Large triangular craft seen hovering over power lines It was around midnight on April, 20th, 2009.  I was driving down the highway to bring a friend home when we both noticed a bright light about a mile or so up ahead, low to the ground.  As we continued to towards it, the light became brighter and still remained low to the ground.  My initial reaction was that it was a spotlight or a low helicopter or something.  As we drove up on the object, which was about 50 yards off to the side of the highway in a field with high power lines, we both stared in awe as we noticed a giant triangular shaped craft hovering above these power lines.  I was driving and my friend was in the passenger's seat, so he had a better view than I did.  I kept looking over at it every second or so and what I saw was a triangular shaped craft about 60-80 feet long on the longest parts and three bright yellowish/orange lights shining from each corner.  We took a right turn at the next light about 100 yards up the road and pulled right into a parkin! g lot next to this field.  We got out of the vehicle and stared in awe at this giant craft, not making a single sound, just hovering above the power lines.  As we stared at this craft, my friend gets in the car and pulls his camera out.  About this time the craft starts to slowly ascend into the air.  As he takes out his camera to take a picture, the camera reads, \"Memory Card Full\".  He had just taken a pictures a few hours earlier of the night and had not filled up his card yet.  I found this to be very unusual.  As the crafted started to ascend, it rose in somewhat of a rocking motion, then in an instant, it pretty much disappeared from sight.",

I glanced up into a very clear sky and was immediately stopped in my tracks by the sight of 2 \"stars\" approx. 3 finger widths apart, just below Cassiopiea. Being an avid sky watcher, I KNEW that those 2 stars did not belong there. I turned and walked about 5 steps back to my car, so as to brace myself against a stationary object to try and see if they moved. In the 2-3 seconds it took to walk that far, when I turned back to look at them, they had dimmed considerably, and were slowly moving, this time the 2 had become 3 points of light and were slowly moving together. They appeared to be extremely high up. No sound. I am positive they were not balloons, chinese lanterns, airplanes, satellites. No idea what they were. It was just amazing, seeing this show in the sky and knowing it was something unusual and out of the ordinary.

Dad had gotten to the end of the field some time before I did and he was stopping at the end talking to a neighbor over the fence by the road.   They both saw these two lights on the southern horizon at a far distance that followed each other closely across from east to west at a good rate of speed---faster than any airplanes they had ever seen at the time.

      "story": "Round Silver Object Seen In Durham, NC Following an Airplane and Then Flying in a New Direction and Disappearing Around 4:00 pm January 18th on Friday afternoon in South Durham North Carolina on the &quot;Third Fork Creek Trail&quot; in the direction of the setting Sun (West) I looked up and I saw a airplane with a small comtrail heading East (away from the sun) and something else very peculiar was very close to it almost riding next to it without a comtrail. I thought that it looked very strange and was way too close to the airplane for comfort.  The other object appeared to be round and smaller than the plane. Both were moving east, almost paralleled one another and very close it appeared both moving upwards and East. I fumbled with my cell phone camera to try to get a picture and by that time the object split off from the plane and went in a new direction. It was now moving in a horizontal line, where it was headed vertically before with the plane.  I do not have details if it was a exact angle or how this happened but it was then heading in a straight line to the right, due North I believe. So the object is now moving in a different direction from the plane and it looked like it was moving much quicker than the airplane now but not so fast that it was completely unable to track. So I followed it with my eye for a few minutes and the sun illuminated it for about 10 seconds and then it got out of the sun's illumination.  So basically it is a round, silvery gray object moving in a straight line now. I noticed that it had a bit darker silver dome and a brighter silver underbelly and it was not the shape of an airplane.  I say \"dome\" because it was not elongated like a plane, it was more round. I followed it for a while and I knew it was too high up in the sky to get a cell phone image it was just too high!  I also did not want to take my eyes off it!  It was heading directly to the right, in a straight line and then it just vanished right before my eyes.  The odd thing is I had a feeling that it was going to vanish. I don't know how I knew this.  It's almost like a sense that it was going to vanish.  After it was gone I could still see the plane I originally saw and how the other object looked absolutely nothing like it. The weather that day was completely clear, crisp 40 degrees and sunny winter day without a cloud in the sky.  The other planes in the sky all had little comtrails and did not just vanish.  This other \"craft?\" definitely stood out as being bizarre...which is why I am writing this. I spoke into my phone and got all these details down as soon as it happened so things would not fade and get jumbled in my mind.  I hope this report is useful, maybe someone out there saw it too or there is an explanation.  It seemed different that just another plane.  Something unusual about it, which motivated me to write my first ever UFO report.  No one else was on the trail at that moment.  It was like just me and this thing and I was mesmerized just watching it.  It was actually a pretty incredible feeling and I am glad I witnessed it.

This light rose in the air about 200 yards in front of me and a friend while we were parked in my car facing NORTHWEST.  This was around 5:40 EST.  In a populated area with intersections, restaurants and bargain centers.  The sun had gone down but it wasn\u2019t totally dark yet.  The object seemed to have structure but the light was all that could be seen. When it first caught our attention it was rising from at least 50ft from the ground.  As it rose slowly it seemed to come closer to us but mainly going straight up.  It elevated around 500-600 ft then it stops suddenly and at that point we both were puzzled because this wasn\u2019t normal flight maneuvers for anything I\u2019ve seen in the sky and this was so close.  There were no sounds coming from it.  Now that it\u2019s closer it appeared to me there were actually two red lights instead of one but both were bright and bled into each other.  They were side by side but seemed to both be on one object.  I couldn\u2019t make it out clearly, but it looked like above the lights there was structure. The object at that point seemed to slowly spin 180 degrees now showing white lights.  Then it moved to the left and right at different speeds stopping on a dime.  Very controlled and deliberate, as if showing off.  Not very fast, but too fast to start and stop, changing directions as it did.  Then, it shown red again and went away from us, we both got out of the car to get a better view and it lowered behind some trees maybe a quarter of a mile away.  I could see the red light looked to have landed in a clearing and out of view.  I kept looking and 45 seconds later it appeared again rising from the area it had lowered to.  It came back to the same area it was before in front of us.  It performed similar maneuvers again and moved very fast, up and down left and right.  Then it went away behind the trees again once more. I never saw it after that. The size is hard to estimate, maybe the size of a compact car.  The shape seemed saucer like but was not flat.  It moved in ways I\u2019ve never seen before, very stable and strict.  It seemed to be controlled by intelligence.",

Then it moved to the left a ways, then to the right.  It moved unlike anything I've ever seen before.  Changing speeds.  I cannot guess how big it was.  It wasn't very big, maybe the size of a car.  The light also changed to white, as if it had turned around and I was looking at a different side to it.   I got out the car to get a better look.  It went away from me and lowered seemingly to the ground about a quarter of a mile from where it was before, and it got there quickly. I could see the light go behind some trees in the distance.

It was a very blue sky crisp clear day, almost no clouds. It lasted for 2 to 3 minutes & mostly stayed in one spot only drifting to the right very slightly. It seemed very big as we saw other planes cross the same area throughout the day & ones that were lower to the ground you could make out in good detail.  So we do not believe there was any mistaking this ball of light for a plane or anything else. Every 8-10 seconds the light would either blink out & disappear instantly then blink back in or fade to smaller then blink out completely then a couple seconds later blink right back into view.  2-3 minutes of this fading/blinking in & out & after the last disappearance it didn't come back, it just seemed to vanish & we didn't see it anymore that day.  It almost seemed like a solid object but it was so bright white it was hard to decipher any distinct edges.   On examination of video that we took, to the lower right side of the object there seemed to be a much smaller round object floating with it & zoomed out along with it as it disappeared.  But was not visible throughout the entire video, just a few second here & there. ((NUFORC Note:  Video shows a white colored object appearing, and then disappearing, as the witness indicates above.

No blinking no multiple lights just as if a star had dropped down low and was floating over my head heading East.  I watched it fly over head for about thirty seconds and as it got a little past the spot where I was actually standing it just faded to nothing.

For approximately 15 to 20 seconds they were moving in a general area relative to one another, then seemed to cluster into a tighter group.   Immediately after that, 2 or 3 more objects appeared within the group.  This lasted maybe 10 or 15 seconds before 2 or 3 more appeared within the group making the total number of objects 8 or so.  They remained in this cluster for another 30 seconds before seeming to vanish with no discernible movement in an! y direction.   The entire sighting lasted roughly 2 minutes.",

      "story": "Diamond-shaped silent object hovers and passes overhead. On the way to a gas station in northern Durham, North Carolina, my girlfriend and I witnessed an extremely bright hovering object, amber in color.  We decided to drive around to get a better view of it over the treetops and witnessed what looked like a triangular light pattern -- one very large, very bright amber light in the nose and a smaller flashing light on each wingtip and center which stayed illuminated but strobed brighter in order from left to right.  It passed in the opposite direction of our car.  Because it was so far away we could not make out any structure.  The large light was unlike anything we had seen in the sky before in terms of its size and brightness.  Once it was out of view we continued to the gas station. On the way back to the house we saw the object again, hovering back close to its original position.  It was much closer and we turned into a neighborhood to get a good look:  The object was very close.  I would compare it to watching a plane in take-off pass overhead in terms of its distance.  As we pulled into the neighborhood it stopped hovering and began moving -- drifting might be a more fitting verb -- across the sky towards us.  We parked the car and got out as the object passed directly overhead.  As it did we both witnessed the solid black outline of an equilateral diamond:  a small white running light in the center and at each tip with an over-sized, amber-colored seemingly directional (forward to forward-down) light at its nose and a significantly dimmer light on its tail.  The three lights from wingtip to wingtip constantly strobed in a left-to-right direction as it moved away from us.   The object was silent as it passed over and disappeared behind the tree line. We jumped back into our car to try and get a better angle to continue watching it but as we circled the woods which it had passed over it was nowhere in sight -- until we happened to catch the faint strobe of the object now a great distance away. We drove to my girlfriend's parents' house and watched this object glide back and forth across the sky at a great distance -- like a commercial plane at altitude --silently for over an hour.   At one point her mother came outside to watch it pass at about 45 degrees above the horizon close enough to make out the triangular front of the object.  We kept noticing that it seemed to pass in a straight line until we could not see it anymore and then begin its trajectory again from where it started -- but we never saw it fly back.  We assumed that we simply missed its return path.  Finally we watched one disappear not behind trees but simply into the distance and made sure to watch for its return.  It never flew back.  Suddenly it was once again close and over our left shoulders.  We were in disbelief that it could have 1) flown back to this position with such speed and 2) have done so without us noticing. We tracked the object as it passed about 60 degrees above the horizon when suddenly we noticed a second, identical object flying towards us from a great distance.  We continued watching these two objects pass back across the sky. The total sighting lasted from 9:20pm to 10:45pm, which is to say that at 10:45pm I finally came inside out of the frigid cold to write this report.",

      "story": "saw what sounded like a helicopter but looked so wrong once, and then two more times during a meteor shower I had just gotten home from a day with my family.  My uber driver told me to look out for a meteor shower from midnight till six. I was standing outside smoking a cigarette in my driveway when I heard a strange sound. It was almost like a helicopter blade, but it sounded fake. A few minutes later, I saw the UFO. it flew low to the ground from my right side, making an arc all the way around my horizon and disappearing out of view behind the school across the street from my house.  The craft looked strange, with piercing white lights on it and one red light at the front.  The whole thing was lit with an orangeish hue. I pulled out my phone to record this first incident.  I texted my best friend who is a fellow believer and told him I'd send him the video-only to discover the video was completely gone.  There was no trace of me recording even though I had clearly done so. Freaked out, I sit on the curb on my driveway and watch the sky.  A shooting star appears and flies right into the spot I saw the craft disappear from view.  I try to calm down and I make a wish as one is supposed to do.  I'm sitting there watching the sky closely and, texting my friend. I get the strange feeling I am being watched so I stand up and shout \"I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE THERE.\"  Five minutes pass and I see the craft again (possibly a separate UFO of the same kind).  I am so frightened this time, not only because it has reappeared but because it seemed to have heard me.  It comes from the same direction I saw the first ship, but takes a slightly less direct route.  It makes no sound this time. Again, I try to record it with my phone.  This time, my phone actually goes completely dead out of nowhere.  The craft lazily disappears out of view, the same way the other one did. I sit down again and begin to shake.  My heart is racing and I'm scared for my life and my sanity.  I keep watching the sky only to see four or maybe five shooting stars all in the same area I saw the UFO's.  Just as I'm about to go inside and charge my phone and grab another cigarette, a third craft appears.  This time, it's coming from the left of me, and it seems closer than before. The craft appears to have a rotating circle of white lights that almost look like stars. The orange hue is very prevalent and I can clearly make out the shape...  It's almost like a \"cigar\" with lights.  I watch the craft fly towards the meteor shower, make a right turn, and then turn into a single red light.  It was almost as if it was cloaked. My friend arrives on the scene shortly after that.  Scared shitless, we sit in my driveway and watch the sky.  My friend points out a very skinny cloud on an otherwise clear night that follows the path I saw the first craft take.  We don't see anything else for a long time, until I notice a star that is blinking and changing colors, and even moving slightly.  My friend and I grab my camera and walk a few blocks, using the camera to zoom in on it.   We eventually go back to my place and I can tell the inadvertent doubt has set in for my friend.  \"Maybe it's just a star, man.\"  After all the things I saw last night, I can't be so sure.  Not to mention, now on my iPhone there are four black images where the video files should be, and the first time I tried to look closely at them my phone died instantly.",

Two sets of lights, each in isosceles triangular formation flew very slowly over a gas station in Durham, NC.  This was across the street from Planet Fitness on MLK.  I was just across the street.  I wondered if it was a medium sized airplane with all lights turned off and the wings lit up, but that makes no sense.  The lights were not normal airplane lights in any way.  Also the lights moved very slowly and were only about 50 feet above the gas station.  After about 45 seconds the lights disappeared behind some trees.  I do not believe in UFOs but don\u2019t know how to explain this.",

      "story": "Two sightings on cold days (Durham, NC) and 1 on a hot day (Charlotte, NC) with a picture of one Technically, there were 2 witnesses to this event. I was walking my 2 year old son home from daycare, when I put him on my shoulders. It had literally felt like the windiest day NC had ever had. I would know, as I didn't have a car at the time, nor the years preceding and following this event. Whe walking my son through a nature trail, I just happened to look up...I saw a parallelogram-shape open in the clouds, as if a garage door lifted.I blinked several times and immediately stopped walking. The shape stood open for several more seconds, then closed from top to bottom, in perfectly straight lines from start to finish.  This was not the only sighting I've witnessed. I have a picture on an older phone of a second sun-like object in the sky in November of 2013. Both the sun and this bright object were hidden by the clouds that day, so many would easily overlook it driving by, especially with the road layout on Fayetteville st in Durham, NC. I was walking to work at Lowes on the southside of town around 18:00hrs. Once it was in view, I never saw it depart. As I entered Lowes, it was still there.  The final sighting was in September of 2015, near downtown Charlotte, NC. I was walking, again, to a bus stop just southwest of downtown. I seen at least 8 red lights, in the shape of the letter \"U\", in the sky. The difference between the first to sightings was that they or it was maybe 200 yards from the ground this time. It held its position for at least 10 seconds, then one by one, the lights disappeared.This occurred around 14:00hrs.",
