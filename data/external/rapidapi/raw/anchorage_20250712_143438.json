      "story": "I saw a silver sphere over Anchorage, Alaska, It stopped hovered and then disappeared before my eyes. In the spring of 04, as I was driving off Elmendorf AFB, I saw a silver sphere in the sky. I was stopped at the stop light just before the bridge at Mountain View and Boniface Parkway. There were other cars at the light also. I noticed a small aircraft flying from east to west. What caught my eye was it looked to be towing something. This is not unheard of for the Anchorage area, but not all that common either.  I thought it was towing a large balloon at first. By comparing it to the plane, I\u2019d say it looked to be about  eight feet tall. As I was looking at it, it stopped moving and the plane kept going. At first I thought it broke away from the tow rope or whatever, but as the plane flew further away, I could tell the sphere was actually much further away than I first thought. I think it had just happened to be moving at the same rate as the airplane, making it look like it was being towed.  It was very near the Chugach  mountain range, which is east of Anchorage. I could tell it was spinning on it\u2019s own axis. It was totally featureless. Just a silver orb now hovering in the sky spinning. Then it just disappeared. It is hard to explain, but it looked as though  it disappeared on itself as it turned. It never made a sound, but it was far enough away that I don\u2019t think I could have heard it if it did.  When I first noticed it, I was looking through my windshield. I thought it might be some kind of reflection off the windshield, so I rolled down my window and stuck my head out, so I\u2019m sure it was actually there. After it had disappeared, I looked around me to see if anybody else in the other cars had seen it. No one seemed to have noticed it. It was only visible for about 15 or 20 seconds.  I reported this incident shortly after it happened to your web site. It said it had accepted it, but the report never showed on the site. I just chalked it up to a computer error and forgot about it. I\u2019ve only told two people about this incident. My wife and my youngest son. They both laughed at me and thought I was seeing things so I dropped it and never talked about it again. But today, 02/29/08, My oldest adult daughter was visiting with me, and somehow the subject of UFOs came up. Well, it turns out she saw the exact same thing in the same general location about two months ago. So I thought maybe it was important enough to resubmit it. I will leave it to her to decide weather to report her sighting or not.  This incident really occurred. It was a real object, and it really disappeared before my eyes. I am not an attention seeker. I am a military retiree, an ex cop and currently work in the federal security field, so this kind of publicity I don\u2019t need. Do with this report what you will.

It was completely silent, except for a faint noise of some kind of engine, barely audible.  Then, just as it passed the moon, it vanished, and there was no trace of anything out of the ordinary once again.  The street i was on was completely empty, and it was almost pitch black outside.

I was taking in my line and getting my fly rod ready to put it into its case when, out of the corner of my eye, something caught my attention. There was an odd movement in the sky. I redirected my gaze up to my left (Southwest) to see what appeared to be a star of medium brightness making erratic movements in the sky. The spot of light was moving at quite remarkable speeds in an 'S' pattern and then shot off across the night sky at a perfectly straight trajectory from southwest to north at about 11 inches (from my perspective) a second. It then faded into obscurity slowly as it sped into the distance of space above the earth. Then more of these spots began speeding across the sky at breakneck speeds, one after another, back and forth. We must have seem at least a dozen of them. At the height of the activity there were three together in a small portion of the horizon. Two of them almost collided as they crossed paths. One of the spots made an instantaneous 30 degree turn as if it were a billiard ball being banked off of a rail. It was quite curious to be sure. Neither of us could decide what we were actually seeing. The Objects moved far too swift and precisely to be any sort of conventional aircraft or even spacecraft.",

I was just looking at the cloud's and noticed that their was like a port whole through the cloud's that you could see up to the next level of cloud's the lower one I figured where at about 30,000 feet and where high enough that comercial plain's were flying under them as in the hospital you could see Anchorage International Airport of to the south west directly next to the hospital in Maril field private airfield and just north is Elmendorf Airforce Base wich you can see all from the 6 th. floor of the hospital room we were in . I just left work and showed up in his room had not been their 15 minute's when I spoted the ball or bb I called it as it was so high that you could only refure to it as a bb it was at about 60,000 to 80,000 feet up as the aircraft I ! seen flying had wingspan's of 200 feet at least as one plain flew by was 737 and another was a military transport both flew under the cloud mass and they appeared to have a wingspan of a 1\" to 1 1/2 \" span at the hight I seen them not sure if this is a good way of showing the size or not but the bb was two to three times the hight of the passing by aircraft and appeared to be just a attimate object that did not move the whole time I watched it and I told my brother man their is a UFO out their and I got to find some one show it to and I looked out the coridor to see if their was a nurse or doctor to show what I was witnessing and no one was in sight and at a minute of viewing this object since it didnt move all that time I figured I would go down the hall way and find some one wich I did and when I returned with a witness it was gone . I only wish I had stayed but all my life I never seen nothing I could not explain and this thing sat at that hight and didnt move . This was! daylight and heavy cloud cover and if it wernt for the portho! le and t he object to be sitting in the middle of the blue clear spot you would not of ever spoted it . It was like they were useing the port hole to spy or at least be able to down through it their was no other porthole's or any other blue sky showing any where so that is the only reason I spoted it .",

It was outside of my dads work at the time he went off to get something inside, so I was bored I looked out the window and happened to get a glimpse of it.  This aircraft was very slow if it was an airplane it would have fell right out of the sky.  As it rises from the trees spiraling in the air it continued to spin as it went off into the distance. This sunflower seed shaped aircraft that flies horizontally and vertically while in a rotating motion, this aircraft that is a dull blue gray was rounded everywhere and had some sort of window or some circular shaped panels all over the back side  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what made it move or if they are lights, windows I don\u2019t know.  This aircraft flies silently send slow breaking the laws of gravity is what it seems to me. I just had an encounter and wanted to document it and get it off my mind.

AS i was trying to drive and watch it at the same time, the object begin to move down, than stopped, I pulled into the gas station and gave my boy friend a call to tell him what i was seeing, the object disapered.   I got out of the car and just watched the sky as the man that worked at the store asked me what was wrong. I was kind of afriad to tell him i thought i just saw a ufo.  So i just kept it to myself.

      "story": "Two small orange lights flying over Anchorage It was New Year's Eve 2010, and I stepped outside to let my grandmother's dog out at about 8:10 PM. There were fireworks going off all around, so I instantly looked toward the sky when I got outside. The very first thing I noticed was a small orange light traveling fairly slowly moving from east to west. It was going slower than an airplane and was fairly low to the ground. Lower than an airplane would probably be flying. There is plently of air traffic over Anchorage all the time, so I know what I'm talking about and this was definitely not an airplane. I watched the thing very closely, and it was a steady light -- no blinking.  I tried to make out if it was a large craft, but it was too dark and all I could see was the light.  And it was not fireworks either, believe me.  I saw it moving and all of a sudden it made a strange move -- about a 23 degree shift to the right effortlessly.  At that point it looked like it was going to fly almost directly over my head! , so I got excited, but all of a sudden the thing started going straight up in the air. It went straight up to the point where the light was so small, it was about the size of a star. And there were two stars up in the sky and I swear they were moving around, but maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I wear glasses and my vision is not great, especially things from far away. I was squinting as best as I could, and I could still see this light traveling now toward the southwest. It was obviously very high in the sky at that point, and I watched it about another three minutes until it just stopped. At this point it was no longer orange.  It was what I'd call a black or gray light. So you'd think it was something impossible to see, but I could still see it because I had been watching it the whole time. This was the point where I figured it must be a very large object because it was very far away at this point. And it just started falling straight down. It was falling faster ! than it had been moving the whole time. I heard no sound, but ! keep in mind I was near a busy road and there were fireworks going off all over the place. But I made a conscious effort to listen for sound from it, and there was none. I watched it fall for about 30 seconds, and I looked back toward the east for a second and I saw another light. It was the exact same thing flying at the same rate and roughly the same path as the original. I watched this one for about 10 seconds and then I looked back to the southwest for the other one, and I could no longer see it. So I looked back for the new light, and it was gone. I scanned the sky for about another minute, and I could not see either of the two lights, so I went back inside.",

We are both professionals and I am also in college for Astrophysics. We were both completely sober and have no history of mental health issues. We had been there for about a half an hour it was then 11:00 pm and we had seen over 10 meters, a few satellites and of course some planes (the plane that flew the highest was still nowhere near the altitude of what I witnessed). We were both sitting in the truck and it was parked facing the Big Dipper. I was looking at the Big Dipper when I noticed a light (same light intensity and hue as the star) moving rapidly around. It was next to a star that is almost directly under the second from the last star making up the handle of the Big Dipper. It startled me because what I saw first was a light, the same size and brightness as the star, shot out to the right from in front or behind this star, then almost instantly two more (slightly smaller in size) lights came rushing towards the first light and stopping dead underneath it on either side making a triangle formation, this lasted just a second. The first light darted down several inches in the sky (this was at an extremely high altitude) the other two followed even faster circling and darting around it, crossing over it as it kept darting away from them. They seemed to get closer and further away all during this, at one point it was very hard to see the! m. It was about 2 minutes in and we had gotten out of the truck to see better. Right as we stepped out my Fiance finally looked to where I was pointing just in time to see the first, slightly larger light dart straight down at an alarming rate, we lost sight of it for a second then saw it rush (again at a ridiculous speed) straight up again, this time a few inches to the right  from where we lost it. It seemed to have lost the other two lights (I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re the same ones) and then, again, out of nowhere, they appeared at either side of it and their interaction started again. They were darting all around the area of the big dipper, faster than anything my Fiance or I have ever seen. The smaller two kept darting away and then would bombard the first light for either side and cross over it, however, it was never the same move twice. It looked eerily like military tactics, however, it seemed to be outside or just inside of the atmosphere. We watched it go on for over 20 minutes, it put both of us so on edge, mainly because, for the first time in both of our lives, we only had one explanation, and that is extraterrestrial crafts.  We finally had to stop looking and left shortly after. Neither of us could sleep that night and we aren't the kind of people to be \u201cspooked\u201d easily.  What we saw is the kind of image that is seen in sci-fi movies, NOT real life, however, there is no denying the activity we witnessed. Both of us are born and raised in Alaska and spent our entire lives looking up at night. Over the years we have seen many strange air crafts coming from Elmendorf air force base that we live near, and pride ourselves on being able to recognize terrestrial crafts and not jumping to conclusions. My Fiance has spent may years studying air crafts and is able to recognize them on sight, even the lesser known ones. We would never have believed it if we hadn't seen it. There is no possibility that it was some sort of advertising lights, I have never seen anything other than stars and satellites at that altitude, and satellites do NOT move like that, nor to meteors.  This was completely erratic and spontaneous movement but seemed very apparent what the craft was trying to do (get away from the other two). I know of only one other person besides my Fiance and I who saw this anomaly and that person has no relation to me and knew nothing of what we saw when she told me, her description is on point to what we saw, and I hope that she chooses to report her sighting as well. We tried to video tape it, however, we only had our phones and neither of them could zoom in close enough to see the lights.",

It's taken me a while to work up the will to let this out I never even told my family or friends.  Anyways I was walking my dog in my neighborhood when i was about 13 and glanced up in the sky.  What I saw about 500 yards (guessing) away was a vertical chrome cylinder shaped craft of some kind with rounded ends just perfectly still and silent in the air.  Nothing human made can do this.  It was a clear sunny day I just turned my eyes back to where I was going and kept walking and ignored it but after about 5 seconds then it made me curios and I looked again and it was still there I stopped walking and watched it for about 15 minutes.  It never moved just hung in the sky motionless the entire time.  Then a truck came up the road and I was forced to move when I looked back up about 30 seconds later after the truck passed it was gone.  I absolutely could not find it in the sky and looked for about 5 minutes then walked home.  I then went on my deck of my house and looked for it for about a half an hour and could not find it.  I have always wondered what it was and never talked to anyone about it. People just call you crazy for this stuff.  But I know what I saw and it still is in my mind today.

Not consistently either like you would be on a plane.  And at times the object would almost seem to disappear but then would reappear always in the same place.   My friend who was with me and been in the military for several years and we both agreed this was no plan or satellite as it had not moved what so ever.  We definitely new it wasn't a plane when a commercial jet proceed to fly underneath it.   We observed the object for about 30 min before gro! wing tired and going to get.

Did not see them leave the ground because we were approximately 5 miles away and the tree's were blocking the ground.  Looked like it could have been coming from the old Airforce Base off of Raspberry Road. First, three came up and went to the sky then four, then one, then two (not in that order) probably 12 - 20 in all.  I don't know - but, there's probably some sort of rational explaination. I would not say that I believe in extraterrestial UFO's nor would I say I don't believe, there's just no proof.  So, right now - I just saw some unidentified flying objects.

I noticed 2 orange lights in the same vicinity just above the treeline and west of the road through the front windshield.  The orange lights were similar in color to the street lamps common to Anchorage;  however, the orange lights were at a higher elevation than street level.  At first, I thought they might be lights atop radio or cellular towers, but as I focused, towers never manifested themselves and I wasn't aware of any towers in the residential neighborhood I was near.  That was my initial judgement as to elevation.  It was dark and the UFO's never manifested shape or elevation - only orange light.  The lights also appeared stationary.  There were small aircraft operating that night with the customary white lights or blinking lights.  As I turned west onto Abbott Road and then north again into a neighborhodd on Cathedral Way.  The lights appeared d! irectly overhead and visible through my sunroof.  I opened the sunroof to get a better look.  At this time, only one orange light was visible to me.  It appeared stationary but then began to move in a southwesterly direction.  No engine noise heard.  The orange light was round/oval and flickered slightly before the orange light dimmed completely.  At that point, the object resembled and appeared to have altitude similar to a satellite moving in orbit.  I followed the object until I could no longer see it.  So, not sure if I was catching sun off a large satellite moving in polar orbit (i've seen plenty of satellites orbit and never one display an orange light like this one) or if I was catching a drone moving in the area or something else.",

      "story": "Two large, bright red, circular objects falling out of the sky over Elmendorf AFB I work at Lowe's right outside the gate of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage Alaska.  At approximately 4:00 p.m., I went out to sit in my car to take a lunch break but stopped before I got to my vehicle to chat briefly with a co-worker.  I happened to be looking north toward the Muldoon base gate and saw two huge balls in the sky hurdling to the ground.  They were bright red, yellow, and pink (the sun was setting, so that could explain the color) and were traveling/falling at the same speed right next to each other.   To me it seemed they were approximately 100 to 200 feet apart, but I have no way of gauging the distance from one another, nor how high in the sky they were, only that they were falling fast, as though they were crashing to the ground.  They could have been meteors.  I watched them fall for about five minutes before the clouds obstructed the view. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Hmm...definitely weren't contrails. I'm an Air Force brat and have lived on air force bases my entire life (and still do) and have seen every imaginable jet in the sky from A-10 Warthogs to F-22s, and this was like nothing I have ever seen.  I watched the sky for quite some time afterwards and saw no aircraft flying.  These balls of light were vivid red and very distinctively circular in shape.  It was around 4:00 Alaska time, which means the sun was starting to set, but it was by no means dark out.  There was a short trail of light following the objects that like I said were yellow, pink, and red, but the objects themselves were red.   The fact that I watched them in the sky for five minutes tells me they must have been way up there.  As I watched them, I assumed they were meteors, it's just that I have seen meteor showers in the past and they always had long \"tails\" and were much more brief, and weren't nearly as colorful.  Also, they came down almost completely vertically, slow enough that at times it seemed like they were suspended in the air.  Have you heard of large meteors like this? ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness reports that the objects were not conventional \"contrails.\"  Meteors are not visible for five minutes.  PD))",

This could be best described as a very brightly flashing spherical/maybe oval shaped light moving about randomly initially.  It was actually spotted by one of my supervisors while we were on the tarmac at Ted Stevens not far from the UPS and FedEx parking.  When we first spotted it, it was moving about randomly low along the mountain slope in a weird, unpredictable circular pattern like it was pacing a bit before it started traveling across a greater distance and at a slightly faster speed.  The unknown object's bright white blinking light moved fast low on the mountains in almost a straight line after about a minute or two, still flashing.  The time posted is estimated.   It moved far too low and too fast to be any sort of small aircraft or military aircraft, or even a vehicle which might have made the most sense, but even then the light was too bright and flashing too constantly at such a distance, and they generally don't flash that bright while moving either.  It covered a lot of ground and seemed to disappear closer to the Cook Inlet by where i live farther south along the mountains towards Girdwood.   Note that had it been bright enough or a normal moving flying object i would have seen it past the last visible slope of the mountain chain in the south Anchorage area unless it turned around the bend out of sight.   Regardless it seemed way too bright and big for any sort of ground vehicle, and I can tell the difference between small aircraft, helicopters and higher flying jets at night.   Unfortunately I was not able to get any videos due to the distance this object was spotted at, nor would the results be good with the camera on my smartphone.",

We had no curtains on our picture window yet because we were in the process of remodeling.  The couch I was sitting on was directly below and along side our picture window and the TV was directly in front of me.   Out of the corner of my eye I caught something that drew my attention.  I turned around and looked directly out our picture window and I saw a craft up close between our neighbor's house and ours stationary, hovering between the two buildings.  I could not believe what I was seeing, the craft was maybe ten feet away from me.   I knew it was hiding, but I did not understand from what.   I watched it and got a good detail of the underside of it.  I was like it was semi on its side due to the space confinement between the two houses.  No sound came from it and it had three lights on its belly that were white.  The body was metallic, silver like.   I could not believe I was seeing, and afterwards, it slowly took off and it did so slowly and upward, with not sound.   After the event, I got on the phone to my mom who lives about a half a block away and told her what happened.  She said she did not see anything, but heard military jets flying around.  We both thought that was really usual because we never hear military jets in our residential area.   Days after the event, I drew many pictures of what I saw and I will never forgot the incident.  Somehow I believe that this was no accident, that this UFO wanted to be in the area and maybe wanted me to see it.   I would like to know if anyone has had a similar experience here in Anchorage.

      "story": "It was Sunday morning and it was like 3:14.  I've had just finished delivering newspapers with my brother,something I do everyday.  So as I was getting out of the car I stoped and looked up to watch the northern lights.  And as I was watching I saw what looked balloons like 8 of it and was yellowish like the size of a basketball if you were to see it from were I was standing.  At first I thought it was one of the group of birds I had saw earlier. But as it got closer saw it can't be balloons it's to dark to be able to see a balloon.  I told my brother look a ufo I was joking and he said those are just balloons and went inside the house.  Well I kind of started to believe too that it were baloons, until it went a little higher and I could still see it.  Then I said to myself if those were balloons you'd probably couldn't see it from here, then I was 100% sure it was balls of light.  So as the ball of lights went bit higher coming from the opposite direction was anoth! er balls of lights same everything except it was reddish it kind of met up with the other ball of lights and sort of circle each other then both went higher and higher in the sky then it started to look like stars then stoped for like 15 second then it started to line up perfectly and then started to move toward the center of the sky. And when it got there the northern lights started to make its way to the lights and started surrounding it 10 seconds later when the nor the lights was gone the balls of light was gone too....September/20/2015",

I was just going to try to ignore what I saw, because as weird as it was, it was descending in altitude over the huge joint Army/Air Force base near my house, JBER.   When I was trying to Google stuff about UFO's, which was weird for me anyway, I found another documented sighting on the list from Knoxville, TN, on 8/15/15 which was identical in every way to what I saw.  No difference.   At first I looked for an aircraft pulling a sign, but realized that it was definitely something, rectangular/louvred and moving slowly under its own power.   I have seen some strange things over JBER, so I tried to forget it.  It was SO CLEAR and interesting.  I tried just to forget it.

When it first showed up, it was a complete orb without any \u2018hole\u2019 in the middle.  It was super bright and made absolutely no noise.  It just hovered in front of the house. As it started to ascend, it began to change to the object he captured.  After I filmed this, I switched to looking through binoculars. It continued to ascend and I saw it go from the orb to finally a very clear triangle with nothing in the middle.  Kind of like the old cowboy dinner bells. Through the binoculars, it suddenly showed what I\u2019ll call \u2018radio waves\u2019. Then suddenly it disappeared\u2026. not into the clouds\u2026. just poof, gone.

The object had a very peculiar wobble and tumble to it as it pret! ty much remained on a straight heading moving from N/NE to W.  It was unlike any plane, helicopter, drone, balloons or birds that I've ever seen and I am at a loss as to what it was.  It IS a UFO in the truest sense of the term, although I can't say with any assurance that it was a \"space craft\"  it is most definitely an enigma.

It could make abrupt 180 degree turns and other maneuvers not possible with today\u2019s modern aircraft.  With some binoculars, it looked like a single bluish white light with the intensity of a bright star.  Broken high altitude clouds were moving thru the area and its light would be obstructed as it flew thru or above the clouds.  It appeared to be at or just above the clouds as its light would dimly reflect off the clouds. \tI first saw the light around 9:20 p.m. Alaska Standard Time.  There were 3 other witnesses when I first saw the light.  I was near Mile 109 of the Seward Highway when I first watched the light move around the sky for about 20 minutes.  I drove home and arrived around 9:50 p.m.  At this time I had 4 other witnesses see the light moving around in the sky as the night grew darker.  The light hung out in roughly the same part of the sky near the Constellations Cygnus and Lyra.  A witness and I laid down in our front yard and watched the light move around for another 50 minutes before we went inside to write this report.  By this time the sky was mostly clear and dark and stars were visible. 20 minutes later, the light was still visible continuing the same motions as before.  A second light was seen shortly after I arrived home but we did not maintain visual of that object for more than a minute while we focused mainly on the original light.",

As we fallowed the road it lead us deep into the mountains.  The clouds were so low it covered the top of the mountain (we've had a lot of rain the last few days) but had a clear distinction on where the cloud ended and the mountain began.   As I was admiring the edge of the cloud line through the open window, three lights appeared in the corner of my left eye.  When I looked right at it I thought it was a plane but it wasn't moving.   At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks but while I was watching it seemed as though it jumped across the sky to the right.  To be honest I was so shocked I couldn't speak to signal my friends.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  As I kept watching it jumped again this time downward horizontally to the left.   I leaned my head out of the window to get a better look.  I was finally able to find my voice.  I shouted over my friends loud music, \"Guys!  It's a ((deleted)) UFO!\"  Literally, as I yelled the UFO disappeared into the clouds.   At that point I told my friend to turn around and take me home.

      "story": "3 orbs in the shape of a triangle, morphed to a long thin line of light above treeline in Anchorage While taking the dog for a walk, at University Lake in Anchorage, we headed through a treed trail and on to a clearing.  After Several seconds, my Daughter said \u201cdad, look at the lights in the trees\u201d.  To the North, I saw three white orbs in the shape of a triangle rise above the tree line.  It appeared to turn West, and as doing so, the \u201corbs\u201d turned into a long thin bright white light.  Like a long fluorescent light bulb, but so much brighter.  It then headed West and no lights were visible.  I opened my eyes wide to let as much light in as possible (the moon was not above the horizon at the time).  That is when I noticed the shape, very much like a box kite, but with triangles on top and bottom; essentially an elongated diamond.  We stood there for about a minute after and headed back down the wooded trail talking about what we had seen.  After about 40 yards, I said let\u2019s go back.  I was shining my flashlight on the tree line and my daughter said that if ! we see anything she will record it with her IPhone.  Once again, three orbs in the shape of a triangle appeared in the same spot slowly rising above the tree line. This time my daughter took out her phone to record and her phone died.  She said it was at 60%.  The same scenario as above played out, the orbs turned to one long bright light, then as headed West was just a dark silhouette of an elongated diamond until it went out of view (total time about 20 seconds each occurrence.  At this point we left as it was cold.  My daughters phone did not turn back on until we got home and plugged it in.  it immediately showed 62% of battery power.",

Three hours after witnessing one large, bright, orange orb travelling south-westerly over mid-town Anchorage, I sighted upon three identical orbs a few miles (in my estimation) above the ted stevens international airport property.  These were moving around in separate, oblong paths at casual speeds, with sometimes one or another momentarily breaking away from its path to perform a zig-zag or to move somewhat farther afield, and every few minutes all of them slowly dimming and returning to full brightness.  After about 20 minutes of watching they simultaneously dimmed out for good as a routine aircraft was making its approach from the Chugach Mountains.

      "story": "Red round lights in 5 or 6 groups of 3 lights each hovered over Hillside(?) area during midnight fireworks seen from Tikahtnu area. From the viewpoint of the north end of Muldoon area near the Glenn Hwy, at 10 minutes after midnight (Happy New year's, guys!) we saw 5 or 6 clusters of what looked like small orange steady lights, 3 to a group, each group of three kept a perfectly tight triangle pattern/formation.  They came up from the south at a medium speed, too slow for a firework rockets or flares, but faster than most airplanes. They slowed to a stop still in formation & still due south, hard to guess the distance being dark, but my guess would be about 500-800'in altitude & maybe 5-8 miles due south from us. The groups of three seemed to keep perfectly together within each group as if there was one object with three lights each but the different groups of three would vary slightly in position relative to the other groups.  Once they stopped they were still moving slightly around but staying in the same rough area.  There were no flashing lights but the Orange balls seemed to slightly pulse with a subtle color shift from almost yellow to deep reddish orange.   After watching for 2-3 minutes, I ran inside to grab my camera but when I got back less than a minute later, they were gone or moved too low to see due to a 2 story apartment blocking my view.  At first I thought they were part of the neighborhood fireworks, but after watching, it was clear that they weren't. We were joking about the fact that they SEEMED to act like they came in close to watch the midnight fireworks show, then left when the fireworks were thinning to a close. Also, they made no sound that could be heard.  That could have been because of the distance and/or the fireworks' noise.

Upon opening the door, I immediately noticed (my dog also noticed) a very bright white/ light blue pulse of light.  The location of this light was West of Anchorage, above the Chugach Mountains.  The pulse was slow, and I observed no movement (up/ down/side-to-side).   Immediately following the pulse, a streak of light passed directly under the location of the light pulse, appearing to be a shooting star (quick movement North to South, and left a visible trail behind).   Immediately following this, two more light pulses of the same color/shape/ brightness flashed.  Each happened at a slightly lower altitude (beneath the \"shooting star\") than the initial light pulse, but were identical in duration, brightness, and color.   After the third pulse, no subsequent sightings were made.  No flashing lights/forward movement/ or noise were observed.   It did not appear to be a commercial/ military aircraft and had no observable beacons.   The brightness and color were  quite notable, even causing my dog to pause and take note.

When we turned right to head South onto Hoyt St. it turned right as well and headed South at the same altitude.  We were then alarmed and started eliminating options like aircraft, helicopter, perceived distance, etc.  After eliminating all known possibilities, with the object continuing to follow we became concerned, started to walk towards it, yell at it, and threw snow balls at it.  The altitude was too high to hit the object.  The object was not deterred.  We gave up attempting to scare it off and continued to proceed South on Hoyt St.  The Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) proceeded to follow us.  At approximately E 6th Ave. the object shot off, heading West, at a visually trackable but incredible rate of speed, just ! to the South of downtown Anchorage and disappeared over the horizon as it appeared to cross the Cook Inlet.  - IMPORTANT NOTES - The Bright White Orb approached behind us from the West and followed adjacent or parallel to our right or South at a distance of approximately 60 feet (altitude 75-150 feet). WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT? It occurred to me just yesterday (08/03/2017), after 35 years, that this object was most likely intelligently operated. WHY? If the object would have approached us at, or near, that altitude from any other side it could have dangerously interfered with the \"take-off\" and \"landing\" Flight Corridor of not only the military, at Elmendorf Air Force Base, but also the civilian, at Merrill Field Airport.  The object followed us just a few hundred feet to the West of the Elmendorf AFB Flight Corridor and departed silently at instant mach speeds just a few hundred feet North of the Merrill Field Flight Corridor, heading West past and parallel to Merrill Field. HUMAN CRAFT OR PLANE(?): Not a traditionally recognizable human flight vehicle, it was silent, it hovered, it could stay aloft at walking speed, it made two perfect 90 degree turns, it instantly accelerated to greater than mach speeds with no jet type visual exhaust and no sonic boom(s).  It specifically followed us and stayed just outside the two Flight Corridors (military & civilian) by just a few hundred feet.  If it was a human plane, it could not have performed in such a manner and its flight path would have been \"in\" one of the Flight Corridors.  I grew up in the cross section of the military and civilian Flight Corridors.  I watched literally hundreds of very low altitude civilian and military aircraft, landing and taking off, day and night (Cessna's, C-130's, F-15s, Visiting Blue Angels, etc.).  My reasonable assessment, then and now, is that this was not a traditionally recognizable human flight vehicle.  - DISCLAIMER - I am only relaying the facts as I recall them.  I make no claims as to the objects origin or purpose.  It could be the false recollection of a youthful imagination.  Nonetheless, with due diligence and intellectual integrity, I have considered and reasonably dismissed all normal or likely origins to account for this object.  Simply put, the object \"appeared\" to be an Unidentifiable Flying Object with uncharacteristic flight behaviors.

((NUFORC Note:  Witness submits a very nice photograph, showing five bright white, or yellow, lights, positioned against a dark nighttime sky.  PD))",
