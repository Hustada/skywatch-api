I looked and observed (I know this sounds crazy) a blurry object the shape of a yoyo.  The outer parts were dark with the inner part being lighter.  This object was motionless.  It then came into focus as it rotated and became a long shiny dark cylindrical shape.   I ran outside to get a better look.  It took me less than 5 seconds to get outside, but by that time it had vanished.  The worker across the street said it had come rapidly from the east to the point were it became motionless.  It was not a balloon, a helicopter or a plane.   To this day I still cannot quit thinking about what it might have been.",

      "story": "Two hovering orange circles drop third orange circle over oklahoma. My girlfriend and i were driving home when both of us noticed three \"planes\" within a mile of each other directly north of our location. We both have an interest for all thing abnormal and interesting so we kept our eyes on them hoping. One of the objects did turn out to be a plane and veered off from the location while the other two orange lights remained, hovering in the air. We stopped on a very slow overpass to watch further because they had been hovering in the same place for well over a minute. We watched as one of the lights began to get brighter and brighter and slowly drifted around in mostly the same place, it just sort of floated. The second object began to slowly fade out until it was no longer visible. Just as we were fixing to start the car and leave (she had to be home by 22:30) the one still hovering seemed to have a new seperate ship drop from its side. The first ship then began to lower until it was no longer visible over the city lights and trees. After it was gone the new ship began to glow brighter and brighter just as the first did. We watched this ship hover in place for around 2 minutes until it finally began to lower and dissapeared just as the first had. All three ships were orange/yellow in color similiar to the color of a street light. They were circular and generally had very little movement probably only travelling back and forth within a miles radius. They did have some horizontal movement but like i said they always stayed within a mile of where we first sighted them. The sighting occured in Oklahoma city, OK. I have contacted the news to see if anyone else noticed them last nite. The only thing that i can possibly think of to debunk what i saw is that the location i saw them is about 45 miles west of tinker air force base which has been known to test new planes, but even still i highly doubt they would of been testing anything like what we saw.",

      "story": "Black oval object in sky flashing blue lights that \"winked-out\" followed by a circling jet and then three helicopters. My son and I were playing tennis at Memorial Park (1150 NW 36th St, Oklahoma City, OK 73118) on April 19th, 2019.  It is an azure blue, cloudless sky with light north winds and was approximately 67 degrees Fahrenheit.  My son was on the south side of the court facing north and I was on the north side facing south, and the sun is directly to the west of us at about 60 degrees.  I\u2019ve included a Google Earth Map image of our line-of-sight (UAP-1.png). Off to my left side (southeast) in the background right above the tree line at about 40 degrees (the tree line is roughly 250-300 feet from us), I see a bright blue flash and look in that direction (UAP-2.png).  My first thought is that someone let go of a blue Mylar helium balloon, and that I\u2019m seeing the sun\u2019s light reflecting off the surface.  I point at it and tell my son exactly that.  It moves from east to west (left to right from my viewpoint) and passed behind the trees so he doesn\u2019t see it at first.  He backs up to the net as I move up to it and point in the direction.  I tell him it\u2019s about to pop up from behind the tree and it does.  Only this time it has moved closer (at about 45 degrees) and is a black oval with two intermittent synced blue flashing lights on either side.  It stops moving in the sky (UAP-3.png).  Movement from point to point was approximately 12 seconds. So now we think we are looking at a drone, but it is really way up in the sky, and doesn\u2019t have aircraft navigation lights of red and green, just the dark, but bright blue similar in color to Dell computer system lights.  The blue is darker than the blue sky but also brighter than the sky when they flash.  It stops directly above the trees (but not actually above the tree because it is obviously way in the background behind it). Then it flashes brighter than any of the other times and it winks out and disappears (UAP-4.png).  My son says, \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d Puzzled by how a drone could just disappear, I pull out my phone and note the time.  It\u2019s 5:37 PM CST.  We continue searching the sky for about another twenty seconds.  Granted, from the time I saw the first flash and it disappeared was only about thirty seconds.  So almost a full minute from the first sighting, at 5:38 PM CST, a jet races from the east to west on about the same plane as the object and makes a bank toward us going north and flies a loop right around where the object disappeared so that it ended up flying back to the east in the same direction it had come from.  The plane was high enough that I could not make out what it was or how many engines it had.  It was too fast for a prop plane.  The plane itself actually gave us perspective the size of the oval.  At first when we thought it was a drone, I was thinking that it was two or three feet across.  However, after seeing the jet in the same place in the sky, the oval had to be the size of a car because it was s! lightly smaller than the jet.  The jet leaves the same way it came (UAP-5.png). We realize that with all the people at the park playing tennis and basketball around us, we are the only ones to witness this in the sky.  We keep watching the sky to the southeast.  At 5:43 PM CST, directly behind us coming from the northwest, a low flying red with white trim helicopter (300 or 400 hundred feet above us) races overhead in the same direction as where the oval disappeared (UAP-6.png).  It moved so fast that it cleared us and was gone in about three seconds.  Fast enough that we could not make out what was written on it.  The only two helicopters that I\u2019m familiar with in this area that are that color are a news channel helicopter and the med-flight helicopters used by hospitals. At 5:51 PM CST, a second helicopter, one farther west of us, also flies to the southeast in the direction where the oval disappeared.  This one is the KFOR Channel 4 News helicopter.  I can read it clearly on the side and it takes about ten seconds for it to come into view and cross the sky out of view heading southeast. At 5:55 PM CST, a third helicopter, this one\u2019s way farther east of us and heads to the southeast in the same direction as the others.  This one is black with red trim, but is too far away to make out who it belongs to. As each incident occurred, I noted the time, descriptions, and directions.  I did not get any photographs as everything happened so quickly, but I logged it all in my phone to refer back to later.  It could be completely coincidence and that none of this is connected.  I could not find out any info regarding why these choppers were heading where they were going.  There was no stormy weather for storm chasing. I have included drawings where I have recreated to the best of my knowledge keeping the proportions as close as I remember them to be. The resolution is high enough that you can zoom in on the areas and see the details and colorings of the object. As a side note, Tinker Air Force Base is in Midwest City and in the vicinity southeast of Memorial Park in Oklahoma City about 15 miles away.  My guess is that what we saw was even farther south than the military base.  Will Rogers Airport is in Oklahoma City and is southwest of Memorial Park by ten or so miles.  Having said that, we are used to seeing all kinds of planes coming and going all the time, and even the occasional drone.  I don\u2019t know what this was.  I\u2019m not calling this a UFO, through it certainly is an UAP to me.",

On April 19th my dad and I witnessed a possible UFO in the sky.  My dad and I went to go play tennis and arrived at a park with several tennis courts at 5:00.  We played until my dad pointed out a shape in the sky.  He told me to come over and look up.  I looked and saw a black oval.  My dad thought it was a balloon until it started blinking blue.  We then thought it was a drone hovering in the air.  It stayed in place for a little until I looked away for a second and it was gone. My dad said he saw the \u201cdrone\u201d give a big flash of blue light and disappeared.  We started speculating to what we witnessed.  We thought the idea of a drone flying away really fast in a split second was unrealistic. \tLater a jet flies overhead towards where the \u201cdrone\u201d was.  For the next several minutes helicopters fly in the same direction.  A news helicopter, a red helicopter with white letters, and a red and black one all fly by in that direction.  After that nothing else happened, but left a lot of speculation of what we witnessed.",

I followed the obeject as it moved from West to east for about 4 seconds. The lights were dim but obvious. I would estimate that it was 4 to 5 miles high(based on the dimness of the lights). The size of the object would be about the size of a pencil if held out at arms length.  There was no blinking of the light and the light ran the entire length of the object.  The object was blurry. My reaction was WTF???? as I watched it disapear into the glow of the City lights in the East.  I live between Tinker AFB and the Oklahoma City airport and am used to seeing all types of aircraft going by, to include blimps and helicopters. This was NOT a normal aircraft.  I am submiting an animated gif of what I saw. I created this using photoshop. The Animation recreates what I saw fairly good except for how high the object seemed to be. The size and speed and brightness are pretty accurate.  My animation:   http://www.freewebs.com/mikebo2/Music/Animation%20What%20I%20saw.gif   I reported this to MUFON and they did a follow up \"phone-interview\".  I later created this animation and wished to share it in hopes of finding anyone else who has witnessed the same or simular phenominon.  Thank You for your help",

I was at the Lakeside Country Club Teen Dance on a weekend during the Summer of 1963 or 1964, located off Portland and 63rd street on Oklahoma City.  The dance was held outdoors around the swimming pool area. About 10:00 p.m., the band stopped playing and everyone gathered around the pool, looking at these strange lights hanging in the Northern sky.  There were about 4 or 5 of the white cicular lights hovering in the sky but not moving.  Everyone tried to reason what they could have been, but no one has an explanation for them.  Alcohol was not allowed on the premise. Most of the kids (150 or so) were from Casady, John Marshall and Putnam City High Schools. This sighting was the talk of the schools for serval weeks.  I have always believed to this day they were UFOs and still do. What prompts me to report it now is the news yesterday the ex-governor's UFO sighting in Phoenix and the French releasing their UFO information.  What the ex governor saw is exactly what I saw.

      "story": "Triangular light formation suspended high in air Shortly after 6:00 AM, sometime in September of 2006, I was heading east on my way to work along I-40, just north of \"Stockyards City\" where I-40 turns northeast for a ways before heading back east. I noticed a formation of lights suspended at what I estimated to be a couple hundred yards to a half mile off the ground, about 50~100 yards north of the highway.  I no longer am positive about the exact pattern or number of lights, but what I do remember is either a cluster of three white lights forming a close triangular at what I took to be the tip of the triangle at the east, or else a single white light at the east--either way I took that to be the front of the craft. At what I took to be the rear--the west end--were a row of about five lights, lined north-to-south. They were not uniform in size or shape, that is, three or four were red, with one of these beings smaller than the others, and one other of these lights was white--I don't remember its relative size. Between these two \"ends\" of the object were other lights, reddish or even a little orange; two or three of them, a little smaller than most of the lights at the rear. As an electrician, I noticed that the quality or type of light emitted from all of these lights did not seem the least bit unearthly; they were certainly not flourescent, a little brighter than what one might expect from normal incandescent bulbs, more like the intensity and quality of shine that one sees with halogen lights.  I was navigating the east-to-northeast curve in the highway while looking at this thing, trying to both stay in my lane and make out an outline of the object. I was not able to see a solid shape--just the pattern of the lights. I told my friend, sleeping in the passenger's seat, to look but he was groggy and not awake enough to understand until we were well past the spot. He did not see anything, and went back to sleep.  I have seen airplanes fly parallel to I-40 on their way west to land at Will Rogers Airport. But (a) they fly much higher than the thing which I saw, (b) their lights flash, this's did not, (c) they speed past even at their higher altitudes fast enough to recognize their movement from my truck, this thing was clearly stationary, (d) the pattern and number of lights did not match what I am familiar with from conventional aircraft--for example, the two or three lights I saw in the middle were spread too far apart north-to-south for this craft to have had a standard airplane shape. (e) from the intensity of the light, it was clear that this thing was far lower than any airplanes. (Again, the lights were neither flashing nor moving, and I noticed dust particles floating through the lightbeams immediately below the sources of light.)  While I don't doubt that advanced civilizations may exist which could travel here from their own worlds, I also don't necessarily ascribe what I saw to otherworldly technology. Maybe it was a test flight of some fancy new  military plane from the local Tinker Airforce Base. I don't know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

We discussed the various possibilities, including a helicopter, airplane, balloon, etc. All these possible explanations were rejected by my daughter and her husband. The object was about the height of an airplane coming in for a landing. The possibility of a balloon was rejected because the object started moving in a northerly direction (against the wind) and then moved back into the original position.

Just got off work, was walking torwards my car and happened to look up at the sky.  What I saw was 15-20 tiny pin dots in the sky flying around together in a group or cluster.  They seemed to be alluminated by something and were a glowing orange/red color.  They were very high in the sky.  Flying around similar to the way a group of birds would.  But there is no way they were birds because they were too high in the sky to be able to be seen.  I know these objects were extremely high in the sky because an airplane flew over head about 60 seconds after they were gone and it was about the same distance up, (maybe a little lower) and was much larger.  Whatever I saw must have been large in size to be able to be seen at this altitude.  After realizing that I might be a witnessing an UFO, I decided to watch one of the objects flying around.  So I focused on one of them....it did a few zig zags and loops and then completely vanished.  So, I decided to get someone to witness what I was seeing.  I went back into the building and found a colleage of mine, and brought them out to see what I had seen.  When I looked up, there was nothing in the sky.  Absolutely nothing, whatever I had seen was gone.  It did not take me more that 15-20 seconds to find my work colleage.

Hello, Was idly staring out my fifth-floor window overlooking downtown Oklahoma City looking north when a white object that appeared to be round was zipping across the city from west to east.  It went behind an apartment building and emerged on the other side and then disappeared in front of a cloud. Then, about 15 seconds later, I see a black-colored helicopter come in from the east and stop at the very spot where this object had vanished. It hovered there for about 20 seconds and then went back east and out of my line of vision. One thing about this object is that it seemed to be revolving on its axis, because it would go white and gray and white again. Very strange. I would add that two days earlier, around the same time, I was 20 miles south in Norman, Oklahoma having lunch with my father-in-law, when I saw a bright object of similar size traveling in much the same fashion.  The difference was is that it seemed to leave a short \"exhaust\" trail or something behind it before disappearing in front of a cloud. I should also note that Tinker AFB is not far away from both sighting locations.",

We live in an apartment complex, and the surrounding lights in the complex were too overbearing to view the meteor shower.  We then walked to the street where there is no ambient light.  I was looking North-East in the direction that the meteor shower was supposed to appear.  Suddenly I saw a meteor.  My son did not see the meteor.  I directed my son in the direction that the meteor was in.  Almost immediately, we both saw this set of orange lights fly over head from North-East to South-West.  It sort of resembled 7 orange birds flying in a \u201cV\u201d formation.  The object made absolutely no sound!  We didn\u2019t see it coming over the horizon, it just appeared.  Almost like the lights just came on.  We tried to follow it, but it disappeared over the South-West horizon.  But it was again almost like the lights just turned off.  Maybe you have to be directly under the object to see the lights.  I\u2019ve seen many pictures of this type of craft before, but never in my life did I think I would actually see it myself.  It scared my son pretty bad, so we went inside and did not watch any more of the meteor shower.  I'm sure that if someone else was watching the shower that they too would have seen this craft.  Having my son with me confirmed that I was not out of my mind.",

It would stay in one spot for 45 mins or longer then move in small partial circles or short moves horizontally and vertically. At one point I stopped watching for about 1.5 minutes while changing positions to view from and it had either moved quite far, like from 3 o'clock to about 10 o'clock on the horizon, or I was seeing another one in that location. I looked in first location trying to determine if it was indeed the same object. I could only see the one, now much higher on the horizon. It appeared to be the same object I was watching a minute before. Over the next hour it slowly kind of wandered (for lack of a better word) south until I could no longer see it.",

The craft was hovering and slowly moving south , toward the airport. From my point of view I could see the red lights of a water tower stand still as this object moved in the background, from one side of it to the other, like it was moving further and further away the whole time strobing the length of the craft sort of giving it a shape it happened this way until about 8:08p.m. when it moved out of sight. About 25 min. later I saw two planes flying in formation which is weird because I never see that sort of thing, except for at an air  show, or on T.V. and the thing about those planes that caught my eye was that they strobed at the same time and stayed at the same altitude, flying the same length apart for what looked like the whole city . Later that night about 9:15 p.m. I was returning home from dropping off my friend, driving east on N.W. 30th street crossing N.

      "story": "Possible booster streams in a state with launch sites I've been able to find. First off, I'm not assuming this is extra-terrestrial.  I think it might have been some kind of rocket, and am primarily looking for ways to check and see if any known launchings were taking place on November 6, 2009, at about 6:50 pm CST near Oklahoma City.  I don't know how to look for that kind of information, since searches online aren't bearing much fruit.  I was driving home with my boyfriend, and for about seven minutes, we drove towards a little pink dot near the sunset.  From far away, I asked my boyfriend what he thought it was, and he guessed maybe Venus.  However, as we got closer, the object got significantly larger.  We only traveled about two miles, so I don&#8217;t think this thing would have been particularly high in the sky.  When we saw it at its closest, it appeared to be two white streams being emitted from a single tiny black dot situated above the streams.  That dot flickered orange frequently.  I&#8217;d pass it off as a jet using its booster from Tinker Air Force Base, but this object did not appear to move.  My boyfriend said it looked like it might be moving slowly upwards, which would make sense if the streams were coming from thrusters.  Unfortunately, I had to turn the car at that point, and we couldn&#8217;t see it anymore.  It had gone from near the horizon to almost directly overhead as it got larger, and once we turned, it was obscured by the car roof.  I rushed home, which probably took about five minutes, grabbed my camera, and ran back out...  But we couldn&#8217;t find it again.  I saw an airplane flying on the horizon near it, when it was still too small to distinguish the streams.  The plane was much smaller than the shape, even then, and looked farther away.  I could also see the plane moving, while I could not observe the object moving.  It seemed terrestrial to me, maybe a rocket taking up a satellite or something.  I just don&#8217;t know where would be close enough to launch something like that, for it to be close enough to visually change so significantly in size after driving only a couple of miles.  If there is anywhere I can check records of what&#8217;s been launched when and where, I&#8217;d really like to check out whatever it was that I saw.  Location information:  When we lost whatever it was, we were facing West and turning South on N 122nd and Memorial in Oklahoma City.  Image information:  I couldn't get a picture, but I did a couple of quick illustrations.  The first shows the shape from far away, when we first saw it, and the airplane behind it.  The second shows how it looked when we saw it at its closest.  I don't see where to attach them to this, but I will email them to the address provided.",

It appeared to be either oval or triangular in shape and was lightless. The only light that was present was the streetlights reflecting off of what looked like a metal hull. I kept going the same way until I came to a car stopped on the side of the road with two people standing outside staring at the object.  I stopped and got out and asked them how long it had been there and what it was, they said that it just showed up out of nowhere and they didn\u2019t know what it was.  After about 30 seconds of us standing there the object moved further east very rapidly until it was out of sight.  We decided to go further down the expressway to see if we could catch another glimpse of it. After about a mile it came into view again for about 1 minute before it flew off even faster than before and we lost all site of it. We talked about what we had seen for a couple of minutes and were honestly just wierded out by the situation.  We decided that there was no reason to call authorities so we said our goodbyes and headed our separate ways. This is not the first time that I have seen an object near or around NW Expressway but it is the first time that anyone else has seen in and it was bigger than ever before.  In all honesty I believe that it was some alien spacecraft, there\u2019s no other way I could explain it.  This was definitely the strangest thing I have ever seen in my life.

Hi nuforc staff this is a first for me and i feel silly actually going to the trouble to send this report, but i cant help what i saw on the evening of wednesday december 24 .  First i must say that i have seen what i believed to be a ufo several years ago (5 or more)  that was three very bright lights in the shape of a triangle.  There were muptiple witnessness that saw the object that simply disapeared after a few seconds.  So in saying that, since that incident i have become obsessed in watching for ufos or anything that could not be explained.  I have become an avid skywatcher and have not seen anything out of the ordinary since, until now.  After this incident i searched online for the proper way to report this type of thing and i found this is the way to go. On the evening of Wed. Dec 24 2008, after trying to return a christmas gift i was heading home in the major metro and just before i reached my destination i witnessed a large strange orange light in the NNW sky ahead of me.  I just happened to stare long enough approximately 6-8 seconds to witness another much smaller light that appeared to be the exact same color as the larger light eminate from the larger one and slowly float to the earth in a straight line.  When the smaller light appeared to reach the ground the light in the sky just disappeared. My first impression when i saw the light was an airplane but i remember thinking quickly the plane has dirt inside the light because of the odd color.  Then when the smaller light appeared out of the other i was quickly thinking that sparks were coming out of the plane and i was witnessing a plane malfuntion or crash.  Then when the second object never flickered and went to the earth at the same slow speed and as soon as it seemed to reach earth the object in the sky simply went out, i knew i was seeing something unordinary.  So i pulled off the side of the road and stopped to look for a plane or helicopter.  I stared at that part of the sky for anything flying and seen absolutely nothing.  The background was nothing but sky with a few high level clouds.  I hope to talk to any representative who wishes to hear this account in person.

I was looking up at the night sky when in an eastwardly direction about 45 degrees from the horizon, when I thought I saw a very bright star. This sparked my curiosity because I had never seen a star that bright before.  After about 5 seconds the star faintly pulsated once, and then grew brighter in intensity.  After it grew brighter the light shrank into itself and disappeared.  The light was a darker blue, not the normal blue you see in any celestial body.",

      "story": "Circular crafts blinking red, yellow, orange, green, and blue My husband and I had just got done watching a movie when we decided to go out to our apartments pond area.  It has a nice open space where the stars are visible with a picnic area that you can sit at.   We went out wanting to enjoy the nice weather and have a romantic ending to our night.  It was around midnight when we went, walked to the back of the pond and sat down.  We where there for aproximately 10 minutes when I looked up saw something circular blinking in the sky. The object was towards the south of us flying lower than an airplane would, and it was blinking red, green, orange, blue and yellow, something an airplane would not do.  I urged my husband to look at it, and he agreed that it was not a plane.   The object was not moving at all, as if it where hovering.  We both at the time just kind of blew it off a bit,joked about it being a UFO we lit a cigarette, and looked up and it was gone.  This is when we began to freak out and get real serious about it, realizing that we where talking about it and observing it for at least 10 minutes without it moving, and then it just disappeared. We continued to scan the sky when I noticed the same looking object to the west of us.  Appearing about 5 minutes after the other one dissapeared.  It had the same blinking colors, only the distance seemed closer, and lower than before.  We kept watching it hover in place, shift to the left and right real fast, and then at moments it would stop flashing colors and turn a yellow-orange color.  It also would get distant and then come closer.   My husband then noticed to the north another one, by this time I am really freaking out, and almost in tears because I cant believe my eyes.  My husband on the other hand excited about what he is seeing.  My husband watched the one towards the north as I watched the one to the west.  We would report back and forth to eachother what they where doing as we watched.  My UFO then shifts right then zooms left leaving a trail of light behind it then dissapears in a split second.  If i would have blinked I would have missed it! Im still not sure where it d! issapeared to. Since the UFO I was staring at had disappeared we both continued to watch my husbands, which was not moving at all.  It was just flashing red, orange, green, blue, and yellow.  I looked over in the direction where the one I was observing disappeared, and it reappeared!  They where both there in the sky again, one to the north, and one to the west.  The one that I was watching seemed as if it would get distant, and then come closer, contunuing to shift right to left and up to down.  My husbands seemed to stay in the same spot not getting closer or farther.  As we observed them seperately we would continue to report back and forth to eachother what they where doing. This all came to an end at about 2:40 p.m. when all the sudden mine turned yellow-orange, then his did too.  Then mine started blinking colors, then his did too.  Then all the sudden both of them began to get distant and higher extremely fast together(still in their seperate directions of west and north), then they both just disappeared.   We stayed until 3:00 to see if they would come back, but they didnt, so we walked to our apartment. From what we collected and witnessed, it seemed as if the two crafts where comunicating back and forth with their lights because one would blink lots of colors then turn to a yellow-orange color, then the other would do the same.   And it also seemed as if the one I was watching was on a mission, as the other one was on the lookout.   We collected this because mine was doing all the moving and his was just still. I had a very hard time getting to sleep after having experienced this.  My husband was very excited about our experience, and was releived that he now knows life on other planets exist.  He seemed pretty calm about it, but still said that he was a little freaked out.   I have never been a believer in aliens and UFOs, but I now honestly have to say, that after experiencing this, I am a believer.  Nothing could explain or justify what we saw.

I went and got my binoculars and when we looked through them I was amazed to see it had strange shape wings and a upper fuselage with what look like 4 engines on the tail.  All this was in the inverted position like it wanted to land some where.  I call for my son to view this and he also wittiness this.   I watched this for 10 to 15 minutes, then craft went up at least 2000ft and then started moving to the north west as it picked up speed.  The craft seem to be in the 40 to 50 ft range; tall. I could tell because it was fairly close to the TV towers, each painted section is 100 ft so I could gauge this a bit.   After this was over I'm sure others saw this since we live in North Oklahoma City.  Also there was no enging noise, the craft was a matt black as best i could tell.  My wife was scared and my son was a little shaken over the event.",

      "story": "Loud grinding/saw like noise woke and startled me. Summer  Night 2001  Oklahoma City,  I was sleeping in my bedroom and was suddenly startled and woken by an extremely loud sawing/grinding sound like a jet airliner was crashing into our one story house. I am not sure if the back yard was illuminated or not as we lived next to an alley with street lamps behind a shopping center that also had security lights on the back of their building and light would emit into our yard over our 6 foot privacy fence. I awoke to an extremely loud sawing noise that made me jump a little up in my bed and I was extremely terrified. I looked at my alarm clock and noticed it was showing 3:16 am.  Which struck me because I had recently converted to Christianity and I immediately thought of John 3:16 (for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son). I then immediately felt like something or someone might be in the house and coming to me.  I heard the door that leads out to the garage and to the back yard door open and shut. I was so frightened that I did not move but laid in my bed in fear. It took me a long time to go back to sleep. I kept thinking about all this and also asked my uncle who was my room mate and owned the house if he had gone anywhere early in the morning and he said no.  I knew he had gone to his room to go to bed a few hours before me so I was puzzled at the door sound.  I started to chock my experience up to a religious event and possibly a religious experience where I might have been visited by angels at 3:16am as a religious omen, but cannot explain why I was so terrified at the thought of them coming in my room after the grinding/saw sound.  It\u2019s like subconsciously I new what that sound meant and it horrified me. I must disclose that I had two previously weird events before that I recalled. One was in 1997 while I was alone at night working security at an apartment complex overnight. It was early in the morning around 2 or 3am and a bright light shone down on my car as I sat in it. I got out after a few seconds to see what the light was looking for. I live in Oklahoma City and it is very common to have OKC. P.D.\u2019s \u201cAir One\u201d police helicopter searching the area for suspects fleeing a crime scene. When I looked up at the light it was so bright I couldn\u2019t make out what I was looking at, but the weirdest part was it made no sound and that freaked me out because I didn\u2019t believe the police were using some conspiracy theory \u201cBlack Helicopters.\u201d I remember I felt freaked out and went into the complex a moment later after the light left. I just wanted to get near other people so I felt safer. Since then I have seen strange anomalies a few times like cluster formations of what I thought were stars in a clear sky and then suddenly break out in different directions and disappear. When I would see this I would go immediately inside my house and turn on the T.V. and try not to think about what I saw as it scared me.  I have also had fits of sleep paralysis from time to time where I would swear I saw silhouettes near the bed moving around and I was completely terrified and couldn\u2019t wake myself. I just chocked it up as sleep paralysis after some internet self diagnosing.  I feel like I have been visited and know things but can\u2019t remember what it is.  I hope I am not to hallucinating any of these experiences because that would indicate possible mental illness and I don\u2019t feel like I have mental health issues.  These occurrences felt genuine and not willed by thought but sudden instances. Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "We saw a low-flying, brilliant, orange object flying silently and steadily from SSE to NNW and are sure it wasn't a traditional craft. My husband, son and I were outside watching nearby fireworks at 10:35pm CST and from the SSE we saw a brilliant orange hovering object heading to the NNW.   We thought it was a local helicopter but as the craft approached it was silent and brilliant in color, like a burning ember.   It was not close enough to discern a clear shape, but seemed almost circular.  It flew in a very controlled manner at a consistent altitude and speed.   The speed was like that of a helicopter also.  The altitude seemed to be somewhere between 8,000 and 15,000 feet.  Difficult to really estimate the altitude because of our uncertainty of the nature of the craft.   After it had passed over us and was almost out of our vision field we noticed that the brilliance seemed to weaken just a bit, but then reappeared as it continued on its path to the NNW.   The duration of our siting was probably 1 minute, or slightly more.   We are certain it was not an airplane, nor a helicopter, nor a satell! ite or slow burning shooting star or firework.  We have never seen a flying object like this.   We do not consume alcohol, nor drugs and have excellent vision and judgement.   We are sincere in submitting this report.   Thank you. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is a supplemental report to my initial report, per Peter Davenport's request.    We called the local National Weather Service to obtain wind direction at the time of our siting last evening.   At 10:00pm CST the ground wind direction was approx 150-degrees or SE heading NW.    The balloon was flown at 7pm CST for higher elevation wind at 3,000 feet and it was reported at 160-degrees or SE, almost a bit SSE, heading NW.    Also, I failed to submit in my initial report that I called a local news channel this morning to see if others may have sited or reported the same thing we saw.  They said yes, they received one phone call reporting this same object at the same time we saw it.   Thank you. ((END ADDENDUM))",

During these hot months I will work late at night and early mornings to beat the heat. On Saturday, july 21, 2012, at approximatly 10:00 pm I was headed to work.  At about three miles out from the shop I noticed this mass of lights ahead to the west and northwest.  I was coming from the east and noticed more and more of the lights as i progressed toward the west.  I was on W. Memorial ave between N. Rockwell ave. and N. Council Rd. As I approached Council road that is when i saw the most lights at one time. They were a glowing red/orange that did not flash but seemed to appear and disappear according to the angle you were veiwing them.  By then I had my phone out and was attempting to record these lights while trying to get safley off the road.  The large group of lights were in some type of triangular formation headed straight west, there were approximatly 15 to 20 lights in this formation and the angle of view would be 25 to 30 degrees.  As the large group went out of sight there were smaller groups, say 4 or 5 lights and i saw three of these smaller groups.  These are the ones I captured in the first video and were coming from the north headed south then turned to the west and followed the large group that was out of sight by then. I then proceeded to the shop, off of Memorial rd. and County line rd. where i shot the second video.  In this video i had turned out the outside lights around the shop hoping to have less light interferance. while filming this  video i was facing dihttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFJD6AUgp18rectly to the south .

We notice no sound was coming from the object and it was stationary transparent alomst but reflected light from the street lights on the bottom.  rectangel in shape two red ligts on one end with a space in between and two green lights on the other end. it was trying to pose as a steet light or helicopter light skeem.  We went to drive around back to it for further detail but when we got back to the spot the craft had already vanished. We think it was observing the cars on the road.

The speed appeared to be consistent, at first, with an aircraft.  However, there were no red or green wing tip lights and no strobe.  I estimated the altitude to be approximately 4,000 feet. I kept my eyes peeled on the objects hoping to get a more detailed look as they got closer, but before the first object was closer than +/- 2 miles, it began to ascend at approximately a 35\u00b0 angle to the horizon.  The orange color faded and the size of the object diminished until it took on a star-like appearance and within a few seconds disappeared.  The three objects following took the exact same path. Moments later there were three more orange lights which took the exact same path.  Following that, a few moments later, there were three more.  Two took the same path as the previous 7, but the third disappeared from view due to obstruction of line of site by buildings, and appeared to take a different path. There was no noise associated with these objects and they were never close enough to clearly delineate a shape.",

      "story": "Nearby nighttime viewing of brightly lit saucer in South Oklahoma City. I live near the woods at SE25th and High Street, just West of I-35 in Oklahoma City.  I walked out into my back yard around 11pm to get some firewood for the overnight, and saw a low flying craft coming from the South, just a few hundred yards away right above the treetops.  It caught my attention because it was so low and had far too many lights for an airplane, as I could see around six or so bright white lights across the leading edge.  I soon noticed it had \u201cpoints\u201d of light coming out the bottom, so I put a hand over one eye to check that it wasn\u2019t just blurred vision from the cold night air as it came into full view, unobstructed by the trees, and it was not blurred vision \u2013I checked both eyes as it slowly approached.  As it drew nearer, passing due North, East of my position, the bright lights were also visible down the side of the craft, just as they had been from my view of the leading edge, and the \u201cpoints of light\u201d appeared to be multi-colored cones of light, three or four of them, coming from the bottom of the craft like a cone, with the point downward.  I continued to watch it pass at a few hundred yards away in the pitch black sky, and believe it was a saucer shape with large bright white lights surrounding the outer edge, the \u201cpoints of light\u201d pointing from the flat bottom center of the craft at a length of ten or twelve feet toward the ground.  From the rear of the craft I could see flashing lights in various places on the craft \u2013none of which behaved like airplane lights, nor were they properly colored \u2013just white lights. I believe it to have been a typical \u201cflying saucer shape\u201d like two tea cup saucers stacked together, possibly with a spacer in between, where the large bright white lights would have been.  I would estimate it to have been about thirty feet across. It flew absolutely silently.  Moved much too fast to be a blimp, but seemed to merely float in the sky, silently, slower than an airplane, but crossed my field of vision inside of thirty seconds, covering probably a mile or so before my view became obscured by buildings and trees in my  own yard.  This thing was close by, and not the first unusual craft I have seen appear to come from these woods over the many years of living here. ((ADDENDA FROM WITNESS)) 1.  Oh, yes -the 29th would be the correct date. I just glanced down at the corner of my screen for the date.I just saw the thing -so -adrenaline! 2.

When it got just past halfway middle of the sky it appeared to change shape, like the front half had slowed down and the back end had to catch up and it had a more cigar shape.  Its direction changed to a slow arc toward the sun.  Then in an instant it starts to shape shift probably because the sun was reflecting off of different surfaces, it gave the appearance of rapid movement back and forth and from side to side violently, it would appear in one spot then disappear and instantaneously appear in another spot near to where it previously was then again and again and again maybe 7 or 8 times  looked like it had a different shape each time while continuing in the same direction.  T! hen it shifted 3 or 4 times more only less rapid and growing brighter as it approaches the sun.  It stops at a distance of about a dime held at arms length from the sun and by this time is as bright as the sun like a mirror held up to it, only much smaller.  It stays in that place for about five to six seconds then it appears to back away a little and all of a sudden it's not glowing any more, it is still close to the sun and should be still glowing but it's not, it has stopped reflecting any sunlight at all and  become a darker greyish color thin horizontal bar shape, much less visible than when I first saw it but can still be seen.

The lights, which were white, had and unusual flicker to them which caught my eye immediately.  I reached into my car to grab some groceries and when I looked back in the sky the craft was now hovering.  My roommate came outside to grab some groceries, when i pointed it out she could tell as well that it unusual.  We watched it for about 10 minutes and it did nothing but flicker its lights and hover.  We finished grabbing groceries and went inside for a few hours. \tI came back out about 2 hours later and the craft was still out, but had moved a large distance to the east.  It was now darker, but I could clearly see the same flickering only this time there were white, green, and red lights.  The craft did nothing more than flicker its lights and hover.  I watched it with a camera this time for some magnification.  The lights seemed to be in a triangle shape, thought I could still not make out a shape of a ship.  The craft seemed to be slowly moving south and after about 10 minutes I went back inside. \tAfter 1 more hour, I came back outside, it was about 10:30-11:00pm, and far to my south was the same craft with the same white, red, and green flickering lights.  It was almost past my horizon line at this point, but the flickering was easy to spot.  The craft seemed to be slowing moving further south still.  At no point during any of the spottings did the craft make any sound.  When I look back on it, almost seems like it was trying to hide in the stars, with the way the lights were flickering, and watch the city.

      "story": "Floating titanium metalic football shaped UFO seen up close over a lunchtime gathering. (This was previously reported years ago and it is shown incorrectly in your database as occurring on 7 January 1980, rather than correctly on 7 June 1980.  Please revise.)   I was part of a group having lunch at a Wendy's restaurant with 8 others.  I was a local college student.  One man had his Ph.D. in history.  Two were recent high school graduates with one of them to enter MIT 2 months later.  The others were high school students who though they watched the UFO, didn't seem at all much interested in what was happening. The restaurant was in a shopping center parking lot on the south side of I-240, facing north, about 150 feet due east of South Pennsylvania Avenue.  I and three others were positioned inside at the table next to the window facing north.  The others in our group were scattered towards the middle of the dining room. The weather was above 90F with a clear blue sky and a stiff southerly wind blowing between 20 and 30 mph.  This location was directly between Will Rogers International Airport 3 miles to the west/southwest and Tinker Air Force Base about 7 miles to the east. The professor at my table looked out the window and said: \"Look at that!\"  We looked up and out the window to the north across the frontage road and the highway to see a floating object just on the other side of the highway.  It was hovering about 25 feet above a field and no more than 200 feet due north of us.  The field to the north side of the highway was at least a 20 acre vacant field with houses on the north side of the field, Pennsylvania avenue on the west side, and the I-240 highway on the south side.  The field nowadays has been built up with several businesses.  Many cars sped along the highway, and I didn't notice one car slowing down to look at the object. The object was easy to size relative to the cars speeding by and was a football shaped, titanium colored metallic appearing \"egg shaped football,\" about the width of a stretch limousine, while not as tall.  Picture it in the proportion of a football with no visible means of propulsion engines.  It appeared to be morphing on the left and right side in a way that it was slightly narrowing and then lengthening.  The titanium colored skin appeared to be rotating on the horizontal axis and then next on the vertical axis.  All of this again while morphing in width from end to end.  I must say I have no idea exactly what it was as I've never seen anything like it. The object was, as I've stated, floating above the field in a stationary position while we commented on it.  The professor stated that this was the second time he had seen something like this as the previous sighting was many years previous when he lived in Springfield, MO.  He then was driving outside of town with another man and they saw a cigar-shaped object above their car.  No further information on that cigar object is available. Before continuing, the reader must understand that I was a builder and flier of radio control model airplanes and knew extensively all the particulars of aerodynamics.  I later after college worked for Boeing in Industrial Engineering and Manufacturing Research and Development. I first thought \"could this be a reflection in the glass?\"  So, I cupped my hands around my face against the glass pane and it looked the same.  I then got up and went outside into the parking lot and it looked the same without any sound, other than the howling south wind.  I knew in no way could it be a balloon of any type with that wind howling as such and the object remaining stationary.   I next walked about 50 feet due west to get a different sight angle relative to the sun.  It looked the same.  I even waved at it to cross over the highway towards me!  It didn't move.   After about 1 more minute, it started slowly moving straight west parallel to the highway about 5 mph.  I went inside.  We watched it continue west about 150 feet until it got to Pennsylvania Avenue, and it curled to the north.  It traveled north on the east side of the street and started inclining at about a 2 degree ascent while gradually gaining speed.  I'd estimate it was eventually moving at nearly 60mph.  It continued straight north until it disappeared out of site over the city. Years later, I worked with many manufacturing techniques and materials at Boeing.  We manufactured titanium parts using a \"super plastic forming\" method for the V-22 Osprey and F-22 Fighter, which resulted in much the same appearance as I saw reflected in the outer skin of that UFO.  No skin seams or rivets - just one smooth continuous outer skin surface.  Another manufacturing method that comes to mind is the now popular 3-D printing.",

We thought it was a helicopter, since it did not move at all for almost the whole time, but we could not hear the rotor.  It was pretty loud during the firework display, but in between the fireworks we should have been able to hear if it was a helicopter.   Another flashing object appeared under it and to the right.  That object was flashing at about half the speed of the first one.   A third object flew across the sky, but the camera phone was unable to pick it up.  We both saw the third one fly through the smoke of the fireworks.   I have it recorded, and would happily email it to your team.  The problem is that the video is 1.86 GB in size, and I have no idea how to send a file that large.",

Sitting on first floor apartment porch behind my mother and with two of my mother's work friends around 21:00, the sky was mostly dark with a small hint of sunlight left.  I noticed a bright red light out of the corner of my right eye hovering over another apartment building.  Not right over the complex, but a couple of miles East of our location.   I turned my head to look in that direction, as I turned my head the red light went away and became a small white blinking light.  It hovered in the same spot for a bit before moving. When moving, the light pulsed out and it reappeared in another spot.  Each time it moved, it moved West towards our apartment complex.   There was a pillar blocking my mother's view, so she didn't notice it until it was almost directly over the complex.  I hadn't said anything to her at this point thinkng it would disappear and I wouldn't be believed.  As it stopped and hovered over the complex, my mother and I stared at it without words, she was still unaware I had been watching it way before she noticed it.   Then it started to pulse green and as it did, its light grew bigger and brighter, along with some sporadic movements around the area in which it had been hovering.  Finally it moved in the same manner, seemingly jumping from spot to spot between light pulses towards the North and out of view.  Multiple times before its seemingly laws-of-physics-defying movements to the North. my mother vocalized her thought that it must be a helicopter before its light turned green.  Needless to say, her helicopter theory was shot down as our jaws dropped in awe when it seemingly disappeared and reappeared miles away.  Certainly no human could endure that type of acceleration and G forces without being fatally injured.   No actual object was viewed, just the light.   This was both mine and my mother's first UFO experience.",

I saw them just before I turned West, into my Addition.  I watched them and kept an eye on them as I passed each block. Looking South down each street I passed; they were there.  I accelerated to 45 MPH to get home and retrieve my camera.  They kept up with my speed.  I turned South onto my street, I saw them flying slowly over the trees at the end of the block. I pulled into my driveway and jumped out.  I heard my next door neighbor's front door shut, I ran over and knocked; saying, \"You've got to come out and see this!\"  He and his friend were witnesses to these lights.  We watched them, their comment was, \"Those aren't planes,\" as there was no sound coming from them!  I then ran to my house and got my camera, they had thinned out and were now heading North.  I filmed them. (in viewing my video the red balls looked as if they were tumbling).  After filming I didn't see them anymore.   I got in my car and and drove South, to the other side of the addition.  I saw one in the sky heading West.   I drove onto the main road and did a U-turn, parked on the side of the road.  I got out ready to film, I saw it disappear.  It was gone, like that!   I posted my video to YouTube.  I have the video as evidence.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z27zZcS_Lw ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport,  I appreciate you getting back with me so quickly.  I've filmed lanterns before and they will emit a swaying, flickering light from inside.  Also, lanterns will rise in altitude.  These red lights kept their same altitude; 40 to 50 feet above the ground. They were flying (west) close together for 5 blocks,  (They also kept up with my speed increase).   They started spreading out and heading North, when I came back out with my camera and filmed them, they were continuing North, then completely disappeared; lanterns don't do that.  That's when I drove to the other side of my addition to see if there were anymore.  I saw one in the sky and it disappeared as I started to film.   I've had several UFO/UAP  experiences and only reported two sightings, this one with y'all and one with MUFON that happened in 1970, (quite significant).  I've been filming since 2012 and have captured many anomalies with my camera and night vision.  In 2016 I started my own Meetup Group, OKC UFO.  It has been therapeutic for me and other members, as we need an outlet to share our experiences and try to understand the UFO phenomena.  Makes life interesting, defies logic and challenges our reality for sure! Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

We were 15 & 18.  No alcohol or drugs ever used.  Pure, welcoming,  No fear. Curious. The night was clear, quiet.  Neighborhood asleep. We kept looking at it.  It just stayed there as if eyes on us.  Then a super bright white light beam was down on us before we knew it.  We could see the direction of beam was exactly shining on us.\u00a0 But when we looked on our arms, legs each other.....there was no light. When we looked in front it was ending on us  It was not behind, or beside. It was directly from the vehicle very high intensity bright light beam. It remained exactly on us. But not visible on us. For about 45 minutes total  Then retracted. And saucer retreated backwards from where it came. Straight. Back North & before very far disappeared again like going back through a curtain .

There was a lot of traffic going both ways. I was heading east on I40 near Choctaw OK and noticed a couple of lights off to the left, north of the freeway, up in the sky.  At first, I thought it was an airplane as Tinker AFB was about 5 miles away, I just went past it minutes earlier.  Here I was, driving down one hill and heading back up another, when I noticed a pair of lights that were stationary up in the sky, north of the freeway.  Just floating maybe a hundred feet up or two hundred. I thought it was weird, because I thought it was incoming aircraft like right next to each other in the sky.  Maybe 50 feet or a hundred feet apart.  Way too far apart to be a helicopter.  They did not move at all, and I thought maybe it was a work crew on a cell tower, with lights, but drove back to work the next day in the daylight and there ! was no tower there, or anything else.  Then a couple of nights later I saw the same thing, same area but south of the freeway.  My buddy was retired Air Force,  I asked him did the Air Force have anything like it and he just shook his head no. I opened my window, and tried to see it, but traffic was moving fast so I just drove on.  All I could hear was the traffic and the wind.

Hi I have witnessed craft every night now for 3 months I know that may sound crazy but it very true I am a very sane person to tell the truth I never believed in this stuff. 3 months ago I began noticing starange lights in sky . I started climbing on the roof at night one night I woke up on the roof after falling asleep and all around me was a smoke or cloud like substance that had a weird smell and I looked and not 10 feet from my face to my left was a very very large craft it looked as if it was made from black glass very sleek . I was very shocked that it made no sound. It slowly backed up about 50 yards and very fastly was gone at first I thought it disappeared but it just zipped off well without sound. Since then I have saw other types of craft and also more of the triangles also. The craft are coming progressively closer each night about 2 weeks ago I started seeing another style of craft very close every night I\u2019m not really sure why me why they are n! ear me but every night even when I leave my home I see the triangle ships follow me through my whole trip. I had contacted mufon when all this all began at first the ships used to stay farther out but mufon sent a investigator who was amazed and confirmed the sighting of these craft. Now these craft come substantially closer every single night for the last 3 months these ships always has some type of cloud substance around them I believe they somehow create this stuff because it help conseal  them. Something I might also add ever since contacting mufon I have also been seeing a lot of drones following me which I believe could be government drones I see a very large drone a lot very very close and this drone is a large square platform type drone with a wheel at all four corners and it has multiple cameras the difference in these drones and why I believe they are government is these things are semi loud to extremely loud and all the exterterestial craft is silent. I\u2019m not sur! e of your procedures but I hope they are different because I w! as very disappointed in how my experience with them was very underwhelming. I decided to reach out to ufo center because yesterday I believe I was possibly abducted for the second time, I contacted mufon after the first. I don\u2019t remember but small bits but the whole day is missing for both me and my girlfriend the first abduction I had a small incision on the back on my head and she had something protruding from her ear lobe. This time she had no marks but I have a small incision to my lower left back.",
