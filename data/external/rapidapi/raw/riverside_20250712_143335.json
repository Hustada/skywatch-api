They seemed kind of low in the sky and were moving to the east.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone but my camera crashed when I tried.  By the time my phone came back on line the object was gone.  This image has stayed with me and I will never forget that night.   It took me years to report this because I didn't know a site like this existed and I feared people (other agencies) would make fun of me.  If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them.",

The sky was cloudless and unusually clear for my urban location. I had just watched several satellites pass overhead, when I noticed a light low in the southern sky. At first I thought it was another satellite however it seemed a lot brighter and faster than the ones I had just been watching. The object was going from South to North and appeared to be at great altitude. Numerous general aviation and commercial aircraft were visible at the same time. The object appeared to be self luminous instead of reflecting sunlight, as it had an unusual blue/purple tinge similar to an electric welding torch. The object passed almost directly overhead of my location, continuing North until I lost sight of it behind the roofline of my house. The light maintained a straight course the entire time I could see it, traversing the sky from where I first saw it to where I lost sight of it in approximately one minute or so. Shortly before I lost sight of the object it blinked out and lit up again in a regular pattern about three times, going dark for several seconds. I checked the Heavens Above site and could find no info about any satellites passing overhead at that time. I also watched the next few nights to see if the object would reappear and I did see the satellites I had seen that night, but no sign of the bright, fast moving object.",

      "story": "Chicago suburbs, strange lights and figures; close contact with figures. This event occurred when I was approximately 5 years old; as such it is an old memory that may be partially \"contaminated\" by the intervening years, but it remains, nevertheless, a very vivid memory for me.  My parents were driving home after visiting relatives. It was late (after midnight) and I was trying to sleep in the back seat of the car. The weather was getting cold that time of year, so all the car windows were rolled-up. We were traveling through an area that was only partially developed at the time--a heavily forested road, or forest preserve land, near Riverside IL--when my father abruptly stopped the car.  I sat up, thinking that we had almost crashed, and looked out the front window. Indistinct shapes moved around a bright light at what seemed like some sort of accident, but I could not see any other crashed cars. My mother kept saying something like, \"What is that? What are they doing there?\" The light extended completely across the narrow road and was a brilliant amber-yellow color with other spectral shades in it . . . like the rainbow hues glimpsed along the edge of a beveled mirror. My mother was talking very fast and nervously and I could tell she was becomming upset. She kept insisting that my father back-up the car and get \"hell out of here.\" My dad shouted back, \"I'm trying!\" but the car wouldn't move. My mom became hysterical when some of the figures turned toward us and started approaching the car.  As I watched I became aware of a presence alongside the car near me on the passenger side. The glare from the light, which now seemed all around us like an enveloping  fog, partially obscured him. This figure seemed to indicate to me that he wanted me to open the car door. When I reached up and raised the door \"button\", my mother began to scream uncontrollably: \"Don't let them in, DON'T LET THEM IN!\" I was unable to see any distinct features of the figures because of the glare around the car but, nevertheless, I could not understand her fear. One figure in particular seemed to want to play with me. He seemed older than me, but behaved just like a funny, playful older sibling. He projected this tremendous sense of warmth and affection toward me that I grasped immediately on a gut emotional level. No fear at all.  The last thing I remember was a monotonous buzzing sound as if the entire rear car window had been covered with insects. (I actually have what may be a screen memory of a thick blanket of buzzing flies entirely obscuring the view from the car's back window.) The car door opened and someone lifted me out. At first I thought this was my father, but it was not; the figure who lifted me was featureless, like a living shadow, without any discernable face. My body went limp, like someone who was asleep, only I was still conscious . . .  but it was as if I were outside of my own body, watching all this happening from a safe distance. I woke up the next morning at home in my bed surprised and confused about how I got there. When I asked my mother about the incident she simply said nothing had happened. To this day she either flatly refuses to discuss the incident or claims she has absolutely no recollection of it. I am a university lecturer. My father is deceased. My elderly mother lives with a 24-hour caregiver. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

A single orange and red ball in the sky was seen by two other friends, my brother and me, while walking up the road returning from fishing in the evening.  It appeared to be about the same brilliance and color of a road flare, producing a consistent discharge of flickering light.   The thing just sort rose up from behind the trees or maybe off the horizon but it seemed close (approx 100 meters).  It was silent and kind of danced around in a slight \u2018zig zag\u2019 pattern bobbing up and down to the right before changing direction left, then leveling to a straight line and blinking out.  It was at what seemed about tree top level in altitude but it was really hard to determine.  It was strange looking at it.  Judging the true distance and altitude was kind of tough because it looked unreal, literally, like ionized gas, or a hologram.   I don\u2019t suppose this is relevant but we were all engaged in very a heated debate discussing the possibility of intelligent life originating elsewhere and the chances of its traveling here, two on one side, one taking a more neutral stance and one the opposite, shouting religious and scientific contentions to support one or rebut the other.  At least one other witness can corroborate and the other two probably would if they could be located; although one was stating disbelief in the whole UFO phenomenon at the time of the encounter.  Despite that strange irony I to this day state, that the object remains simply unidentified. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It was heading from west to the north-east, moving fairly slow and about at a height of maybe 40,000 FT.   I noticed it right away, in that it didn't have the same glow of a commercial or private plane.  Not to mention, the entire object was luminescent/glowing (it wasn't the headlight of an airplane, but just as bright).  Anyhow, as it began to head north, I started noticing small red glowing objects were being released from the craft.  These small objects would propel themselves and an incredible high rate, straight down, or in a 90 degree angle and then just disappear.  These red glowing objects were being released, every 5 seconds or so.  After 3 of these glowing-red objects were released, the craft then released 3 more objects, all at once, then begin to accelerate and incredible rate of speed.  As it was accelerating, it begin to lose it's orange glow and literally began to disappear! Before it disappeared, it seem to accelerate to over a 2 thousand miles an hour (from 200 MPH to 2000 MPH with in 2 or 3 seconds).  I watched this object for approximately 5 minutes (from start to finish).",

The sky was bright blue, with strong, gusty winds blowing from the northeast. I paused on a bluff that overlooks the Santa Ana riverbed to look at the scenery. I noticed a bright object in the sky to the west. I first thought it was a mylar balloon being blown by the wind, however I quickly noticed that it was not moving nearly as fast as, or in the same direction as the wind. Its path through the sky was quite smooth, not like it was being tossed about by the wind. The object was oval and was changing color every few seconds from reddish orange to white. It seemed to me that the object was slowing turning or wobbling, alternately showing a red and white surface. The object was bright, but not glittery as a metallic balloon would appear reflecting sunlight. I watched the object for about 5 minutes as it slowly made an arc towards the southeast. It finally hovered in one spot in the sky. I continued to watch it for another 20 minutes or so, and apparently it was gaining in altitude. When I first saw it, it had a definite oval shape and seemed to be about the same altitude as some general aviation type aircraft that were flying in the vicinity. After watching it hover, the size gradually reduced to where it looked like a star visible in the daytime. After watching the object for almost a half an hour, I started to walk home, stopping every so often to see if the object was still there. I hoped to locate it once I got home, where I could use binoculars to look at it, however the road took a turn through tall trees, and I was unable to find it again. It continued the flashing effect for the entire duration. There were numerous jet and propeller driven aircraft seen in the sky during the time of the sighting. I would assume it was a balloon of some type if it were not for the fact it was unaffected by the strong winds.",

Its diameter appeared to be about that of a pea held at arm's length. It disappeared behind Mt. Rubidoux, which is just west of my location. What seemed odd was the very slow speed of the fireball, the lack of a trail, and the consistency of brightness. It did not resemble any meteor or fireball I have ever seen.

In the sky to the north I noticed what looked like a small orange to red fireball.  This object moved toward the west at the rate of any normal passing airplane.  I ran after the orange glowing object for about one city block, as it would pass behind trees and houses.  Eventually it passed out of sight. After I had returned to my house and sat back down for about five to seven minutes, I saw a second, identical object moving along the same course.  I ran after this one as well, anticipating its course to get a better view.  As it moved into view I thought that it looked almost like it could have been a balloon that was somehow on fire. When I reached the top of the hill, the highest elevation in town, my view could only be obstructed by trees and the nearby church steeple.  Two local acquaintances happened to be passing by on the sidewalk.  I told them to look at the object.  They could not identify it.  The three of us watched the object as it flew away toward the west.  Eventually, without altering course, the light of the object vanished and we could see nothing but stars in the western sky. The weather was calm.  There was absolutely no wind.  The sky was completely clear.  The moon was low in the eastern sky. The object moved at the rate most any airplane would cross the sky, but the light from this aircraft was much larger than any of the small lights on normal planes.  Also, the object made absolutely no engine noise.  There was no sound at all.",

I looked up at the sky as I walked from my car to the house to look at the clouds.  Almost directly overhead, in a clear patch between the clouds, I saw a brilliant, glowing orange V-shaped object.  It appeared stationary when I first saw it.   I went into the house to get a small spotting scope that I use for bird watching and returned. Using the scope, I saw that the V object was not solid orange, but had alternating sections of orange and white.  It had some type of structure to it that I could not quite make out due to distance.  The best I and describe it is a length of a crane or bridge, with it\u2019s intricate crosspieces, bent at a 45 degree angle, painted orange and white. I was not a wing shape at all, as the arms of the V did not have much width to them.   The object would drift in and out of the clouds as they passed by to the NE, the clouds sometimes partially obscuring the object. I would estimate the size as similar to the wingspan of a commercial jet aircraft.  The object seemed to maneuver periodically to remain near the edge of the clouds.  I watched until the cloud cover thickened and the object was not visible any longer, about 5 minutes. I realize this is almost 5 years ago and I am just reporting it now.  At the time, I assumed that, due to the color, it was some sort of experimental device.  I also considered the date (day after Valentine\u2019s day) of the sighting, that it may have been a balloon arch that got loose, but I have since had the chance to observe balloons released into the sky and they did not behave or look they way this object did.   I am reporting it now since I see so many reports of V and triangle shaped objects, maybe this is some piece of the puzzle.",

I suggested we would park on the side of the street for a minute suddenly when we stopped the light stopped and pointed right toward us so then i was joking around and said wouldn't that be scary if it backed up in mid air which planes can't do  and suddenly it backed up in mid air and drove the other way quicker then what a plane could do.",

We live near the Riverside Airport, so we always see helicopters, commercial airplanes and jets fly over us.   At about 11:34-36ish at night, I'm looking up at the night sky taking a drag when I notice a twinkling, moving light.  Thinking it's probably a plane or chopper, I just kept watching the sky. But then I noticed that the twinkling/flashing light was moving pretty fast, and was hovering above a smaller light.  As it flew before me, it spinned like a baton at least three times before I noticed it was somewhat cigar/rod shaped. Meanwhile, I was also trying to get my mother's attention without keeping my eyes off the UFO.  I tried to speak, but all I could say was \"Oh my G-d!\" and \"Look!\".  My mother didn't see anything except the larger twinkling light.  From what I can recall she was either staring at me to try and understand what I was saying or behind me putting something away in the backyard.  I wouldn't call her a witness because 1) she wasn't looking at the sky and 2) she wears triple-lense reading glasses and we were outside in the dark with no lights on. I would call myself an observer.  Every-night I look into the night sky.  Every time we're on a road trip to Vegas, I see at least five shooting stars on the way there and back.  When I was three months pregnant with my boy, I saw what I believe today to have been a comet.  But what I saw about an hour and a half ago was nothing like this.  It was just so surreal, I almost had an anxiety attack.  Funny thing is, now there's a bunch of loud choppers flying over my house, there's been at least three already.  Whoever is reading this may choose to swallow it with a grain of salt, but only those who saw it too can vouch for me.",

There were no clouds, but there was some haze near the ground.  I noticed a light blue object approaching from the South which I at first took to be a satellite.  As I watched, I noticed it was moving much faster than any satellite I have ever seen.  The object continued going North, passing overhead slightly to the East of my location.  Suddenly the object went from medium intensity light blue to brilliant white, and its size seemed to increase substantially.  It was not a gradual transition as with an iridium satellite, but instantaneous, as it something had switched on.  About a second after it turned white, it began making a conical shaped wake which spread out from the object and dissipated.  The object itself began leaving a thin, white trail behind it as well. After several seconds, the brilliant white light, wake and trail went off, and the object returned to its lig! ht blue form.  After a few more seconds, it briefly switched to brilliant white again, but this time no wake or trail were visible.  The object returned to light blue and remained that way until I lost sight of it as it went behind the roof line of my house to the North.  The object was on a straight flight path the entire time, going from South to North.  It seemed to wobble a bit after it started making the wake and trail.  At the time of this sighting, there were satellites and various types of aircraft visible in the sky.  I did not hear any noise that seemed to be related to the object. I did hear jet aircraft but I am sure the source was from airliners passing overhead.  I watched the sky during the same time period for the next two days to see if it could have been some type of satellite, but I did not see anything similar.",

The objects were parallel to each other with the lower one slightly to the right, or East of the other.  The whole sighting lasted just over a minute.  Both objects seemed to light up and then fade, repeatedly.  They looked to be pulsing with light.  Each pulse probably took a few seconds to complete, from getting bright to fading back out.

The sky was bright to the south due to the setting sun, with some high altitude clouds in the background. Visibility was very good. There was a slight breeze from the north, which was slightly bowing tall palm trees in the area. I became aware of a stationary black dot just above the skyline directly to the south of my location. I first took it to be a tethered advertising balloon, but soon realized it was too high in the sky, and would interfere with aircraft. After several minutes I went into the house and got a pair of binoculars to get a better look at the object. With the binoculars I could see the dot was actually oval shaped. There were five or six smaller circular objects spread out below the oval in a semi-circle. These objects were not visible to the naked eye. I watched for several minutes, periodically fiddling with the adjustments on the binoculars to get a better view. The large object seemed to remain stationary, while the smaller objects slowly moved about beneath, seemingly grouping up with each other in various configurations. All the objects were opaque black, backlight by the bright light of the setting sun. The oval looked like it might have had a reddish spot near the top, but it could have been due to the lighting. I watched for about five minutes until I received a phone call. I tried to locate the objects when I finished the call several minutes later, but they were gone. I cannot estimate how far away the objects were but feel they were fairly distant. There were general aviation and commercial aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting. I rule out balloons due to their not reacting to the wind and the regular spacing that the objects maintained in relation to each other. Balloon I have seen released into the sky quickly dissipate and follow random paths following the direction of the wind. I am no computer whiz, but I have made two drawings which I will attempt to attach which illustrate my observations.",

The object looked like a large satellite, blinking on and off in an irregular pattern glowing brightly for about a second then dimming to complete darkness for one to several seconds. My first impression was that it was some type of satellite which was rotating and reflecting the sun, but I would imagine that the pattern of flashes would be at a more consistent interval. The object continued flashing on and off for about a minute. By connecting the locations where the object was glowing, it made a shallow \u2018S\u2019 shaped path, finally disappearing to the northwest.

After the flash I saw a large, wide trail streaking towards the southwest.  The trail was yellowish in color, with green towards the leading edge.  After the flash and trail disappeared, there were two parallel gray streaks which lasted for several seconds.  It didn\u2019t look like any meteor or fireball I have ever seen, maybe space debris re-entering?  It looked more like some type of exhaust trail or plume from a missile.   I checked the local paper and the internet for any other reports, all I could locate was the following entry in an astronomy message board. Maybe someone can identify what TV station the person is talking about. Object crashed by Ca. border last night. Just heard on the news that an object was observed, looking much like a meteor, but changing directions, then hit the ground. News reported within sixteen minutes a bevy of military helicopters appeared, one being a large carrier that picked up the item, still glowing, and left due north towards Vegas. Anyone hear, see, know anything about this?  Wondering if the Riverside group that's having a Star Party this weekend saw it.",

      "story": "Hovering saucer seen during daylight by many witnesses In the summer of 1975 after dinner one evening I was watching TV with my brother.  It was still light out, probably around 6-7pm.  I heard a strange buzzing/whirring sound that started softly and became louder and I said to my brother \u201cdo you hear that?\u201d He said \u201chear what?\u201d   As the sound diminished. A few seconds later the sound came back much louder this time and I said \u201cyou can\u2019t hear that?\u201d He replied \u201cnow I do\u201d and we looked at each other puzzled.  I got off the couch and went and put my ear to the speaker on the TV set to hear if it was coming from there.  It wasn\u2019t.  It became apparent it was coming from behind where we were sitting from outside the window. I walked over to the window and to my surprise a saucer shaped object about 35 feet in diameter was hovering at tree top height over a field between two houses a few hundred feet outside of our window.  We both watched in amazement as this saucer shaped craft hovered in front of us.  There seemed to be sec! tions of it that were rotating, some clockwise some counterclockwise and at different speeds. It was shiny grey metallic and had what appeared to be rows of colored lights.  I was eleven at the time and the feeling of overwhelming excitement was hard to contain.  I had no negative feelings about it. In fact I found it to be a very positive experience.  We were not scared.  It felt like the most magical experience of my life.  Very positive. I ran to get my camera and my brother went to get my sister.  When we got back to the window half a minute later it was gone. We checked the local news paper when it came out the following Monday for other reports.  Many people reported it to the police as could be seen in the police blotter, and later in the week a story came out about all the families who had seen it from a nearby school field while playing baseball. Witnessing that at such an early age has had a huge impact on my ability to accept the concept that we are not at the apex of intelligence in the universe as many would like us to believe.

      "story": "Brilliant green object, seems to launch smaller white objetc On 07/31/2010 I was on my back porch looking at the sky.  The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds. I had originally gone out to see what was happening, as about an hour earlier, a pair of Blackhawk helicopters were circling the area, extremely low with only their battle lights on.  I ended up looking at the stars after they left.  At 2152 hrs I noticed what seemed to be a satellite approaching from the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was moving rather slow for a satellite and moving towards the northwest.  It started as a dim white color but began increasing in size and intensity.  Just when I thought I was about to see a good iridium flare, I realized that instead of flaring and then subsiding, this object was continuing to increase in size and brilliance.  It became huge, larger and brighter than Saturn visible to the west, and the color was now an unusual shade of light green around the edge and brilliant white in the center.  It appeare! d to be self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun.  It remained at its brightest for several seconds, then it suddenly went completely dark for a fraction of a second, then returned with full brilliance.  Concurrent with this display, I noticed a small, white object shooting off to the west at a slight downward angle.  The white object looked like a small, very slow meteor leaving a short trail.  It appeared slightly below the green object and quite a bit to the right of it, but the trajectory of the white object in relation to the green object gave me the impression it had shot out from it. (It is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its appearance and proximity to the green object.)  The green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. It did not just blink off but seemed to \"power down.\" At 2202 hrs., I saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. They performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color.  They too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark.  I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were NO iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings.",

The sky was cloudless, but there was haze or smog which was reflecting the city streetlights, making it rather bright.  The stars were visible, notably Orion, which I was looking at while facing East.    At 1911 hours I noticed movement to the left in my peripheral vision.  I was surprised to see a pitch black object moving swiftly from North to South across my field of vision, passing just below the constellation Orion.  While the object was directly in front of me it appeared as an isosceles triangle, the length being approximately twice the width, with the point at the front.  It was angled slightly away from me, consistent with the object's \"wingspan\" being parallel to the ground and me observing it from underneath from the West.  The object disappeared quickly into the haze as it departed to the South. I estimate the duration of the sighting as 1, not more than 2 seconds.  There were no lights on the object, it was completely black against the slightly orange cast of the sky.  The edges seemed very sharp while it was directly in front of me, but it was more vague as it approached and departed.  There were numerous airliners and general aviation aircraft visible at the time which were clearly audible.  I heard no sound that could be attributed to the passing of the object.  I estimate the object was considerably lower than the airliners I could see which were on final approach to Orange County and LAX.",

It was large in comparison to the stars and planets, I would estimate it was the size of a pea at arm's length.  It was moving quickly in an arc heading towards the northeast, faster than any of the aircraft that were visible but too slow to be a meteor.   The orb had an appearance similar to a circular charcoal briquet, with the center slightly flickering as it moved.  It was not very bright at all, as a landing light on a plane would be, and its circular shape was sharply defined.  It did not leave a trail of any type or make any sound.   I watched it until it disappeared behind the roof of my house.  I ran to the front yard, but was unable to locate it again.   I cannot say how high it might have been except that it did not seem to be as high as a satellite.   There were numerous commercial and general aviation aircraft in the sky at the same time and I could clearly hear the sounds they made.

In the 2nd second and on, we focused our vision on it and instead of seeing it burn out, we saw it was a round ball of bright white light with a short, comet-like tail streaming behind it.  The tail was slightly shorter than what you see on a falling star and of the same white color as the round light that it trailed.  It flew across the sky traveling from north to south in a perfectly horozontal line, at an altitude lower than any airplane in our area and faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen.  It made no sound of any sort.  I am familiar with aircraft, helicopters and military aircraft and have been to several air shows and seen an assortment of aircraft fly but this was much faster and made no sound.  We watched it for about 3 seconds (plus the second that we saw it in our perifrial vision when we thought it was a falling star) then lost sight of it as it passed in front of my house.  We ran to the south side to watch it continue on but we never saw it again.  It looked just like the craft seen in the Lake Elsinor ufo video earlier this year and Lake Elsinor is not too far from here.  March Air Force Base is directly to the east of me, about 7 miles away and this is no like anything that flies from there, much, much faster that any plane I have ever seen, silent and didn't have the flashing aircraft lights.",

To be honest, I was just planning to look at the mountain as I have a thing for mountains. I looked at the orb like floating object for a moment and finally told my friend to look up as the object appeared to just be hovering.  After about 20 seconds, I decided to pull out my Kodak Play Sport Camera...that I always carry with me as I love to take pictures of my surroundings.  I started filming; however, I did not have my glasses on and could not see anything through my view finder, thus I only took a 19 second video clip from this vantage point.  The friend I was with suggested, I take still photos rather than video (which can be heard on the video) and then look at them when I get home to se! e what the object is by zooming in on the object if I actually got it in the picture frame. At first, I thought...maybe it is a star...but I love looking into the sky at daytime and night time, yet I have never seen a star in this location at this time during the day. Due to the brightness, maybe it could be a meteor...but this had no tail, nor did it appear to be moving. Then the idea of a plane was in my mind...but again...this object was hovering...it was not flying in any direction when I first started my observation.  Eventually, I thought it could be a balloon...but again...the object just hovered....it did not move up or down nor did it move side to side...it was stationary for at least 10 minutes before it began to very slowly move in a northward direction. I then thought...maybe it is a weather balloon...but again...it did not move and it appeared to be too low for this type of activity. Additionally, the object was too high to be a hot air balloon. The object itself over the 40 minute time frame appeared to be round but could change from triangle, square o! r diamond shape. Now over the next 40 minutes, my friend and I walked from Mt. Rubidoux \u2026to the Carlson Bark Park and across the bridge to a fast food place (Baker's) on Mission Blvd.  After exiting Baker\u2019s we walked up to Limonite.  During that walk, I took 12 still pictures from different locations and 2 separate videos...one being 19 seconds long and the other being 39 seconds long.  I personally would have watched this object even longer and taken more photos and videos if my friend was not wanting so much to get home before the heat became unbearable...after all, we were on a 6 mile walk.  Yet in the time we did look at this object, it did eventually move northward very slowly...in fact, we went into Baker's and when exiting about 10 minutes later, we could still see the orb nearing the mountains near Ontario or Fontana. Also, during our viewing, I saw at least 2 airliner (jets) fly by...so commercial jets did have an opportunity to witness this object as well.  As far as making any noise...neither of us heard anything.  Eventually, I lost sight of the orb once I got to Limonite and the sun was in my eyes...making it too difficult to see at this point.  However, I do have to say, when I got home and looked at my photos something interesting appears. Remember, at the time, I saw only one object...and that is also noted in the first 19 second video; however, in my first still picture...there is a second object off to the right and when zoomed in you can see a very solid object and yet when I took my second still picture...the second object is gone. We are talking literally seconds from picture to picture and I did not see or hear anything at the time. Yet for this object to be missing in the video and then in the first picture but not in the second picture it had to be traveling so fast that we j! ust could not have seen it. That is it. So yes, I do have pictures and videos from different locations and I used trees, telephone poles, light poles and the mountain as reference points...so it can be verified by qualified researchers. I also did not erase them from my camera, so if real scientist would like to observe it and get the data and meta data from the original pictures and video they have that to reference as well.  I would send in the pictures and videos but I only want them studied and verified by qualified professionals at this time until I can get proper copyrights on the video and photos.

At first i thought i was just seeing things, like 3 -5 seconds later the green light comes back and so i look out of my window and i see a very bright green oval object for half a second because it was moving and lost its view because of my roof the second i saw that i ran out of my car to get a better view but the second i opened my door the entire sky lit up as if the sun was green, thats how bright it got. It was like an adjustable light in your kitchen.  It started off very faint then exponentially got brighter to the point the green was begining to turn like a bright white and then instanly went away and went back to a dark night.  I even saw the clouds shinning green. the craziest thing i have ever seen. so i ran out to the side walk and realized that i was not the only one that saw it because 2 of my neighbors saw the same thing i did. n! o sounds either",

As I was driving westbound adjacent to the 91 freeway I noticed 3 small spheres flying in formation and moving faster than a helicopter or plane would.  They were headed in one direction; south. They were high in the air; if I had to guess I would say about 3000 feet. They were very reflective which is how I spotted them to begin with.  As they flew across the sky they were headed toward Lake Matthews. One split off from their formation and led the other two. About five seconds after that I lost sight of them. This is my first UFO sighting and have heard of many that are not recorded. I've seen and have been around aircraft (former US Navy, stationed on an aircraft carrier). I am sure of what I saw.

The first three flew in a triangular formation, one in front, two behind.  Called my wife out to have a look.  We watched as 5 more passed by at approximately one minute intervals on same trajectories.  Tried to view with binoculars, but red light too bright.  Flew right over March ARB, which is restricted airspace.  Stayed well away from commercial flight paths, of which there are several in this area, e.g., Ontario and John Wayne approach. Note:  these must have been some type of aircraft conforming to aviation rules, which require a red light on a left wing.  But the brightness of the light made them seem to be very close, \u00bd mile or less, while completely silent and very fast.",

IN THE AREA. WHILE DRIVING ON 195 EAST & BEING A UFO ENTHUSIAST, I AUTOMATICALLY SCAN THE SKY SEARCHING FOR THE BRIGHTEST STARS.  I SPOTTED TWO THAT WERE UNUSUALLY BRIGHT AND CONCENTRATED ON THEM FOR A WHILE.  ONE OF THE STARS WAS LOCATED ABOVE THE FALL RIVER AREA & THE OTHER IN NORTH TIVERTON ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE EXPRESSWAY OR IN RELATION TO THE BRAGA BRIDGE ON THE RIGHT.

SURE ENOUGH TWO OR THREE SECONDS LATER IT WENT TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE.  I WAS ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMED!  THEN I NOTICED THE SPACECRAFT, GLOWING LIKE A STAR, CONTINUE IN A NORTH EAST DIRECTION OVER THE BRAGA BRIDGE.

I HAD THIS TREMENDOUS FEELING OF BEING AT PEACE WITH MYSELF FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON. A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER MY GUEST DROVE INTO THE PARKING LOT.  I RAN TO HER DOOR, OPENED IT AND TOLD HER TO LOOK UP AND SHE SAID, WHAT A BRIGHT STAR!  I SAID, THIS IS A UFO.  WE WATCHED FOR ANOTHER MINUTE BUT BECAUSE IT WAS SO COLD OUTSIDE WE RAN TO THE ENTRANCE. OUR TABLE WAS SITUATED IN THE BACK OF THE DINING ROOM FACING THE BAY WITH A DIRECT VIEW OF BRISTOL, LOOKING SOUTHWEST I COULD SEE THE LIGHTED MT. HOPE BRIDGE.  WE LOOKED UP AND WE COULD SEE THE OBJECT, IT WAS IN CONSTANT OBSERVATION THROUGHOUT THE DINER MEAL.  AT APPROXIMATELY 7:45 P.M. THE CRAFT MOVED ABOUT 100 FEET, BOTH OF US WITNESSED THIS ACTIVITY AND AND OF COURSE I STATED, DO YOU BELIEVE IN UFO'S NOW?

The sky is very spacious here.  It was on a clear night on November the 15 at 9:30 p.m.  I was taking my dog out for a potty walk.  I noticed how beautiful and clear the sky was.  When I noticed some aircraft  that I have never seen before flying low in the sky.  They were bright orange lighting, not flashing, much larger than an airplane.  They resembled the size of a space station that I have seen when it passes over.  They were traveling from east to west across the sky.  About the speed of an airplane.  I could not hear a noise coming from them.   There was an  airplane in the sky at the same time which I could identify and hear at the same time the other aircraft were out.  It was traveling from south to north.  The other aircraft all traveled about the same distance apart comeing from the same direction.  I counted about seven when I first noticed them.  There could have been more.   I went in the house and notified my daughter and she came out and witnessed them also.  Then we counted about 17 but there were probably more that we didn\u2019t set our eyes on.",

(PST)  PD)) At 19:21 - according to my phone's call log - I received a call from my best friend, (who lives just over ten miles away in Norco, CA.), telling me that she was startled and amazed to be looking at 'something really weird' in the night skies over her home. As I headed out my own door (to see if I could spot anything), I realized that it was unlikely I'd be able to even see the sky at all - due to massive rains all day and low, thick, stormy clouds not to mention our distance from one another. However, as I stepped out from between the houses and into the open, I found it to be largely clearing above and to the west. As I scanned the dark, patchy skies, I immediately spotted several aircraft tracking and blinking as on any normal, Friday evening. As she continued trying to relate to me in excited bewilderment what she was seeing, I was just beginning to scan the night sky above my own house when she suddenly cursed that it had vanished; it had abruptly just 'winked out'. As she started-in bitterly about its sudden absence, off to my west (toward Norco) - something odd suddenly DID catch my eye and I had to stop her. It was something odd and it was tracking southward. Whatever it was, it was clearly and definitely NOT an airplane. I was confused by its appearance. I initially considered a meteor, but no ...then a comet... but also no. It appeared to be a small, solid, red light, shaped rather oblong lengthwise - like a thick grain of rice - with a comparatively huge, translucent 'bloom' behind it; kind of like the ones that envelop the rear halves of fighter jets as they pierce the sound barrier. But that's not what this was. It was utterly soundless and appeared to be moving more at the pace of a Cessna or helicopter, rather than any sort of jet. Gobsmacked, I focused and strained and squinted to get as good of a look as possible as I mumbled into my cellphone what I was seeing as she excitedly confirmed that it was exactly what she had just been observing. I was able to clearly see it for a good six seconds, as it moseyed slowly along, due south - directly (and maddeningly) toward one of the many low, pink, angry clouds around the area. It then moved behind the cloud from whence I never saw it emerge. I checked the 'color-change' box because although to me the object shone in an unblinking, unchanging 'stoplight red', my friend swears that it appeared as a bright white, to her. But what we both DID clearly see was the huge 'plume' at the trailing end. It was in fact this odd feature that first drew the eye. It looked like the top of an open, translucent 'umbrella' curved back and emanating directly from the rear of the object. Again, there were typical, nighttime aviation activities ongoing in the skies above me - flickering jetliners and local flights headed this way and that at their various flight levels. I spotted about five or six flashing lights immediately and easily identifiable as normal, evening air traffic - but they all seemed oblivious to the object, which - in fairness - was more or less in a patch of sky sort of off to itself - and fairly equidistant from any other traffic. Sadly, I've been unable to find any local (nor anywhere) mention of this phenomenon on the internet. SURELY she and I COULDN'T have been the only ones in Southern California to have seen this amazing object.",

Mom look.\"   Unfortunately, I was in heavy, fast moving traffic and just couldn't take my eyes off the road.  He watched a flat disc move at incredible speed across the length of the mountains.  He said, \"Mom, I know how fast a plane crosses that space.  It takes minutes, and that thing crossed in seconds - the whole mountain range and then just vanished.\"   He couldn't get over what he had seen.   I am soooo bummed I missed it.",

Directly above, was one round red glowing ball, just below the cloud range, easily seen. It moved closer, and I went back in a few steps to get my Nikon camera by the door.  I then went outside again quickly, and was able to get 3 photos of it still there.  The 1st 2 photos were about the same; but the third photo taken as it QUICKLY went deeper into the night sky.  Only in the third photo, did I see any change in shape, from a circle.  Third photo, it was a small triangle with an \"arm\" light streak.  There were no other air crafts in the sky.  There was no sound to the object, and it is very quiet in this area.",

      "story": "Flashing object Sunday morning September 9, 2017, between 1000 hours and 1100 hours, I was working on a vehicle in my driveway, when I noticed movement in the sky to my north-west.  The flash(es) caught my attention as I thought it might be an aircraft making a turn and a reflection was off of a cockpit windscreen.  I watched an object at an elevation of estimated 5,000 to 8,000 feet moving from north to south.  The object moved at a consistent speed and elevation.  The weather was warm with full sun with a very light breeze, barely discernible from south to north, with light scattered clouds that the object moved through or behind in its track.  Flashing as it moved through the sky. I was able to retrieve a pair of binoculars to get a better visual on the object.  By this time my son and wife joined in the watching this unknown object and kept track of its location.  The object had stopped and was now stationary in the western sky for about 5 minutes.   With the binoculars, I could not discern its shape; but the top and bottom portions were flashing separately and very brightly.  The object was emitting brilliant white flashes alternating from what I would describe the top half and bottom half of the object.  It appeared as though the two halves were rotating independently.  I was not able to determine shape. I looked away for about 10 seconds to adjust the binoculars and I lost sight of the object.   My son watched it as it moved abruptly to the west an undetermined distance and it was now, from my position, lower towards the horizon.  The object moved west until it was out of visual range.

      "story": "Light with a trail over riverside The object in question was a blue light.  At first, I believed this to be a star, but when I noticed a trail behind it, I knew it was something else.  Especially at the height that it was, with two planes under it for reference,  I knew that it had to be much higher.   Another thing was that for the height that it was, it seemed to be flying pretty fast.  Almost seemed to be outpacing the passenger plane under it.   The point is, I saw this light, it had a trail behind it that crossed once, like a jet propelled aircraft, it was way too high and fast for it to be a regular passenger plane, and I cant find any information about it on the internet.  I don't think it was a jet either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

N the 1st triangle literally went from perfect 3 triangle to a long /l triangle.  So go back to back yard n I notice yes there is fireworks going on around but there is booms n sounds like boom and hitting something n no sizzle or pretty fireworks in one certain area of the sky.  Like I could still see sky n stars but I could see weird flashes of light in the sky  like it was reflecting behind an invisible object.   N then all of a sudden one of the lights broke away from the 1st really bright light n blanketed the sky slowly within 5 min I couldn't see mountains in background or any of the stars  except  straight up in the sky.  N I suddenly got a whiff of I dunno gun powder fireworks but smooth n less harsh n only for a second.  I noticed the 1st bright light had another light replaced n a triangle again.   I got my binoculars n zoom in the bright light had 3 lights n it was like the triangle was tilted facing toward where the booms were booming from.  I went inside after about 30-45 min n don't know what happen after the.",
