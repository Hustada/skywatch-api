      "story": "Lubbock, TX: saw an illuminated object moving quickly from the south to the north at a high altitude and was being followed by a plane. At around 10:30 pm I was in my back yard and saw a swift moving lighted circular object that was about 35 degrees above the horizon at what seemed a high altitude.  My house faces north and the back door into the back yard faces south.  I was standing in the middle of my yard and noticed the object in the south sky moving north-north west.  One block south of my house there is a brightly lit car lot and birds and bats can be illuminated up to about 100 feet above the lot.  I first I thought it was an illuminated bird as it moved across the sky but as it moved very quickly (approximately 10 times the speed of a jet airliner at cruising altitude)from a south-south west, to west position it became obvious that it was it was not being illuminated from the ground because it never waivered in brightness and appeared to be at a high altitude.  The light was not brilliant more of solid off white illumination.  The light did not blink nor did I see it change color (I am red-green color blind and therefore might not of noticed subtle color changes).  Once it was approaching a due west position I called my wife out to see.  She saw it to and first thought it was a plane but I pointed out the velocity and she agreed that it was moving very fast and could not make out what it could be.  It appeared to very slightly lower in altitude as it moved.  We tracked it from the back yard until my sight line was blocked by my neighbors house.  I then walked quickly to the front yard and saw it in the northwest sky for about 5 more seconds before it again moved out of my sight line by the roofs of houses across the street.  At the point that my sight line was blocked it was only about 15 degrees above the horizon.  I then walked back into my house and back into the back yard.  I then noticed a plane in the southwest sky that was approaching from the south west then changed direction moving north along a very similar path that was taken by the object.  The lights on this plane were a yellowish color and it had a blinking light.  It was moving much slower than the object that had just passed.",

      "story": "March 1997 Lubbock, Texas a large triangular shaped, lighted object with instruments showing hovered for 15m+...shot away My daughter and I were walking back from the neighbor's house. We live across the street from a golf course.  We were watching the sky for the Hale- Bopp Comet and we suddenly saw a triangular shaped object hovering over the entire area.  It was large, we could see lights all around flickering with a bright yellow green color.  We were in shock at first and then began to study the object.  It was low to the ground but not so low it would hit a wire.  I could see into its systems.  This craft had a lot of new mechanisms.  I could see things flashing inside that appeared to be advanced technology.  Having grown up overseas in the tropics with a father who was a flight simulator instructor, I have seen many things in the skies.  This resembled nothing I had ever seen before or ever again.   There was no noise whatsoever.  The craft maintained it's position for what seemed to me to be a couple of minutes.  It then shot out of the area in a blink of an eye. I have never seen anything move  so quickly.  I returned into the house to get my husband. He was worried about me because we had been gone for over 25 minutes. Time had escaped both of us. When the entire family returned outside it was gone, much to their dismay.  I called Reese AFB and asked if they were conducting anything unusual and they replied no flight out. I called the University of Texas Tech to inquire what it could have been. They blew me off with some cooky \"it was the comets tail\".  Well I have seen my share of comets and their tails and this was no tail.  I watched a special about Arizona Lights and it resembled quite closely to what I had seen. That is why I wrote to you.

There was no sound or movement which is what struck me the most. It was a blue color that did shine very bright the starts had not yet appeared in the sky so I could dismiss that very quickly. I stared at the object for many moments till I finally had to leave to go fill a rx for my son.  I ended up at the pharmacy with the object in sight the whole time while at the pharmacy I allowed my wife to go fill it for me so I could watch this object. Moments later the light seemed to have released a 2nd light from the initial craft that was much smaller than the first. It seemed to be lowering it down from the primary craft. It was also glowing but more so a clear light. Then off in the distance I noticed a plane moving toward the object. Then glanced back to the ufo and both lights began to dim until they were no longer visible to the eye.  Local news would have us beleive this to be a weather baloon but it did not move at all or change its position and this does not explain the 2nd object I viewed either. there were many photos taken and many eye witnesses to this event including the ones I named along with my supervisor and co-workers. I have a photo I can text message to you if you like. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME",

      "story": "Large circular steady intense light and smaller less intense mobile companion light. From a location of appx +33 degrees 35' 9.14\" and -101 degrees 51' 49.89\" an object was seen at an angle of 25 to 30 degrees from horizon. If the center of a clock were our location, and 12 O'clock was dead north, the object was north northwest in appx the 11 O'clock direction. The object was quite large for a distant object, roughly 4mm of size in appearance and circular. Incredibly bright and white, it was more intense in brightness than the intensity of the streetlamps on the street below. It gave off no amount of light to the ground or area, the idea is simply to describe the relative brightness and intensity of the light. The object appeared to be at a great distance, and was no more than white light. There was no way to determine any sort of object detail with the amount of distance, but the size and brightness was utterly striking. It was holding dead still relative to a building's roofline below it (simply used to reference). It initially appeared to be an incredibly large and bright star to the observers, however it then began acting very strangely. While continuing its perfectly dead hold, a small light resembling the size and intensity of an aircraft warning light (viewed at great distance), left it. The smaller light exited perfectly from the center and bottom of the large light and had appx 1/2 the intensity of brightness and only a small dot of size, much smaller than the first object. This small light moved slowly and perfectly downward with zero flashing from either object and perfectly steady light and movement (no stuttering or jumping). It had the appearance of a falling flare on a parachute in descent speed, however over the 10 or so seconds of fall there was zero lateral movement. From the original object to its lowest point, the distance was likely 2 or 3 degrees between objects. The smaller light then stopped perfectly still and hung dead still. The total journey down lasted appx 10 - 15 seconds of travel time. The object then hung for 5 - 10 seconds dead still below the first one. At this point the upper object became very slowly less intense, until it reached appx 1/2 original brightness. This made the two objects the same intensity at this point. The small lower object then began to traverse upwards and to the right slightly at the same rate it had used on the descent but now at a relative diagonal. Eventually it passed the original large object on the right by appx 1/2 of a degree and continued until it reached appx 1/2 to 1 degree of distance upwards and to the right of the original object. Using the clock analogy again, with the larger object at the center of the clock, the smaller object was located at appx the 1 o'clock position. During this ascent the large original object began again another very gradual fade and size shift until it was smaller in appearance and eventually equal in appearance to the smaller second object. Eventually the original object became so dim and small that it was unable to be seen at all. The second object remained visible and dead steady for appx another 5 - 10 seconds before it too dimmed slowly until disappearance.  The entire encounter lasted likely 1 or 2 minutes total. The objects were both white light and circular / dot like. No defining shape or features could be seen. No flashing. No flickering. No trails or tails. No other movement in any directions or traversing of the sky in even the most minute amount unless otherwise described above. Zero chance of confusion with aircraft. Only possibilities could be orbital objects. Researched \"Iridium flare\" objects, wrong coloration, intensity, and timing entirely. Smaller secondary object is utterly confounding in movements. Cannot explain the utter lack of movement for larger object. Appeared almost perfectly like a star expect for extreme intensity and size.  Thank you",

The size of the anomaly was pretty decent, about the size of a large passenger air plane.  The weird thing about this is that there was no sound distortion in the air, so I knew it wasn't a plane or big helicopter, and there was no wind so it wasn't as if there was some strange item blowing across the sky. I watched the glass-rectangle thing start to cross the horizon, it looked almost as if it paused, then moved again in stops and starts.  I decided then to go inside to grab something to assist in viewing it better like my binoculars or video camera, but when I came out the pattern was gone.

So I did, and I saw 2 bright objects. They looked circular in shape, and look like they were just sitting there in the sky, noy moving, not flying, not blinking nothing. Just one bright light and another bright light. At first they sort of resembled stars, but way brighter. So I looked around it was pretty bright out when these two lights were in the sky, and there were absolutely no stars in the sky. But I still thought maybe they were stars or planets maybe glowing in the sky from the sun. I eventually watched these two objects until the sun started to set. This is where I could determine if these two objects were. As I saw this I realized this was unique, a maybe once in a lifetime chance to see something like this. So I grab my cellphone for my camera because my actual came! ra is broken, and I took two pictures along with a video. As the sun set, the darkness started to take over and eventually the first light would just dim away, as would the second. That is how I knew they were not stars.",

I continued to watch while my sister went for the brand new sony dcr-sx45 handycam.  Then I started to film and use the 70x zoom, It was then that we realized what we were witnessing a ufo, our first sighting. It was a circle almost plate like and continued to more almost like spinning in place.  To the naked eye you could not see the movement but it continued to spin and dark back and forth, getting closer and further from us with-in the blink of an eye.  Then it started to change color producing a dark but bright purple light, almost like a small flash.  Then it changed into what at first seemed like a cross and then a triangle, at the end of the recording u can see it almost like wings flapping and within a blink it disappeared.

First time, I thought it was a star, then realized it was a little too low, too bright, and was moving, floating alongside my car.  When I stopped, it came to a stop in front of me.  When I made a right turn, and stopped and looked in front of me, there it was again.  I would return to the spot I saw it the first time, and it was gone; then return to the spot it was the second time and it was gone.  Sometimes I saw it vaporize like a cigarette ash, an orange/brown fading light, in an arc that fades.  Sometimes, I see in the place it was before it disappeared, and not moving, appx 4 lights, 2 red and 2 white.  So...it looks like a star that moves ... then changes to appear like an airplane that doesn't move.  Once, it flew directly over me when I was standing outdoors, no sound.  This started appx june 2013.  The star was in the same place nightly, usually appeared before dusk, and slowly sunk below the horizon around 10 pm.  I noticed it t! he first time when it first 'followed' my car and stopped in front of me when I stopped in june 2013.  It was in the north west sky, same spot, until recently.  I noticed around end of december it wasnt there anymore.  Then, a few days ago, as I was driving, there it was in a different direction.  I turned right into a parking lot and got out, looked up, and saw, in front of me, again, as if it was changing direction to stay in front of me, what was 2 red and 2 white lights, hovering, not moving, as if it had morphed into an airplane camoflage, then faded away.  It hasn't been in the NW sky since end of december 2013. This sounds like same thing Ive read in several other posts ... has there been an explanation posted anywhere?

We had finished the discussion and questions portion of the study and were outside in the backyard of the house we were at.  We were engaged in small talk when one of the girls asked, \"What is that?\"   We all looked up at what she was looking at.  It seemed to be a large white blob in the sky that was moving fast against the background of stars.  It seemed to have color separation like a rainbow on its edges.  The effect seemed to wear off and the blob changed to an orange/amber color and it slowed down to a crawl.  When it did this, we were able to see smaller orange/amber colored glowing spheres fallowing it.   There were hundreds of the small fuzzy spheres that followed the large fuzzy glowing blob.  As we were looking at this event we saw a bright blue flash of light that seemed to light up the eastern sky.   We then turned our attention back to the objects in the sky.  They just moved slowly to the western sky from the eastern sky.  We could see, as the moved father away, that they were very high in altitude.   We began talking to each other about what they might be.  And of course this was a group of Bible belt Christians, so the discussion about what we saw lead of into them being signs and wonders from heaven(I never believed that).   A few minutes later we saw one of the fuzzy spheres flying to the south of where we were at the altitude of an airplane.  We watched it move off out of sight.   When I left the house where the Bible study took place I drove my car down the street to the east were we saw the blue flash.  I saw a local electrical company truck in the alley way working on a transformer.  So that might be where the bright blue flash came from.   The next day the girl who first saw the event spoke to her father about it over the phone about what we saw.  Her father worked as an executive of some kind at NASA.  He immediately told her to stop talking to him about the matter, and to never talk to him about it ever aga! in.  He then hung up on her.   She said that this scared her because not only did he never talk to her or their family members like that, but also he also taught them to never do such things.  So this, according to her, was completely out of character for him to do.   We never spoke of the event after that day.  I always felt uneasy about what her father did giving his position at NASA.  I thought someone like him would be excited about such a thing.",

The speed in which the object was traveling was comparable to the speed of the International Space Station.  Faster than any plane I have ever seen.  It also did not travel in a straight line as most aircraft would, instead it traveled closely to the ecliptic line in the sky that night first passing Saturn and then passing Jupiter at relatively proportional distance as it did Saturn.  Object was first spotted in the SE and \u201cset\u201d in the west.  Its lights were rapid blinking at ten times the rate as most aircraft strobe lights do.  One would think it would be a satellite however this was not the case.   When I first spotted the object and made the deduction that it was not an aircraft I trained my spotting scope (one powerful enough to see the lines of Jupiter) on the object.  At minimal magnification it was clear the object was triangular (sketch of object will be included in the report).  I followed the object for about thirty seconds zooming in magnification to get a clear representation of what the craft\u2019s outline looked like.  As I stated it was clearly triangular with lights on the edges of the triangle.  If this were to be a satellite with my scopes magnification (one I have tested on the International Space Station before) if the object was at the altitude of the space station would be easily twenty times the size of it.  I lost the object from my scope around the time it was passing Jupiter and used the naked eye for the rest of the viewing.  I cannot explain what this object was, but am 90% sure it was not a satellite or aircraft.",

      "story": "Object with lights seen flying low above area experiencing total power loss. At 7:49 I received a text from my friend saying something about experiencing about a power outage at a volunteer health clinic he was working at. When I received this text I was driving east on 50th Street toward the direction of this clinic, which was about a mile away. I notice a bright white light directly above the location of where the clinic would be. Upon first glance, being about a mile away, it appeared to be a star but the light began to move erratically in a diagonal path. But the movement was not linear. After some movement it appeared to just hover in one location. As I approached the area more closely, the object might have been mistaken for a drone but it was clear that it was larger and no more than 75  feet in the air. The object is now Northeast of my position so I make a left into the neighborhood to my left. I was able to distinguish multiple lights on the object before losing sight of it as it moved diagonally Northeast. As I navigate th! rough this neighborhood I notice that entire streets are missing power. In a hasty attempt to regain sight of the object I cut through a street with clear visibility but the object has disappeared. As I make a U turn to exit the neighborhood, the power abruptly returns. I couldn\u2019t capture more than a shaky 2 second video of the object that I took while driving which you can barely make out the object if you play in slow motion. You can see that there are two lights visible as it moves.",
