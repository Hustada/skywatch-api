      "story": "Diamond broach shape over Eugene, OR. I was returning from taking my kids to ballet class.  It must have been winter, because it seems to me it was dark early.  As I pulled into my driveway in the north of town, I saw a huge \"diamond broach\" shape in the sky, south-southwest.  It was humungous.  If I had put my hand up, my palm would have just covered it.  It was a triangle, point up, with lights in rows inside the triangle, like diamonds.  I don't recall how many.  It could have been 6 (1 at the point, 2 in the next row, then 3 on the bottom row), or there was another row, making 10.  It wasn't moving and didn't make a sound.  I could see lights from helicopters and small planes heading towards it from every direction.  I jumped out of the car to see it better, but my kids freaked.  They ran to the house, begging me to open the door and come in.  They didn't want it to come get us.  My kids were very young at the time, the oldest about 7, the youngest at the time 4.  I don't know why they thought this thing would take us away, and I wasn't showing fear, but rather fascination, so I'm not sure whey they reacted with such terror.  For them I went inside.  Later that night, or possibly the next night, I chatted with someone on Prodigy (remember that!?) who claimed to work out at the airport in Eugene (the airport was north of the object, behind me while I was watching the triangle).  She said there was some sort of sighting, a report made even, and no official announcement of what it was, but supposedly it was noticed by the airport, or perhaps reported by them.  Again, I can't be sure of the date, but it must have been Fall or winter of 1996, or perhaps late winter of 1997, although I don't remember it being cold, just dark early. It could even have been the year before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Black, round, flat, disc flying twisting spiral pattern over the Eugene, Oregon morning sky. I went outside to smoke my morning cigarette this morning (Thursday 3/6/2008, @ 7:28 AM exactly) when I noticed something out-of-the-ordinary flying in the sky to the east of me.  At first I thought it was a bird, but when no wings were moving I focused in on it with my eyes and figured that it had to be a loose 'weather' balloon, or any type of balloon for that matter, ascending into the sky with the help of the wind.  Then I realized that there was no way it could be a balloon either.  As it continued to travel toward me (to the west) and further North, I was staring at it as its path advanced very quickly throughout the sky.  I could see it moving like no other 'balloon in the wind' would ever move.  It was completely black and its shape was changing as it traveled through the air to the north before disappearing in the light layer of clouds that was layering the sky over the valley this morning.  It was clearly a thin (relative to my perspective), perfectly round disk of some sort, and while it flew, it spiraled and twisted like a flat Frisbee, a CD, or a flat rock would spiral if you were to throw one into the air.  It was twisting on it's axis while flying through the air (could not tell if it was spinning or not) very gently and softly but moving very fast though the sky.  The sighting lasted for about 2 minutes...from the moment I spotted it directly East of where I was standing, until the time it disappeared due North from my position.  I could see that it had a perfectly round shape when the angle was right, and I could also see its flatness when it shifted just enough on its side in the middle of its flight.  Its flight pattern was just like that of a bent Frisbee when thrown upside down...you know, it spiraled, sort of rotating on its lengthwise axis, as it flew, kind of twisting as its path advanced.  If you've ever thrown a CD into the air, it was flying almost exactly like that, but proportionately, probably not as fast as a CD flung in the air.  It had very slow, smooth, ! almost f loating dynamics that made it seems like it was hovering almost...but it seemed like it was moving at a constant rate throughout the sky.  I could see its round profile and its flat profile as it spun/spiraled, depending on its position in flight relative to my point-of-view.  Its color was black, but it may have been that it was being silhouetted or shadowed or the like.  It was a flat, round disk, twisting and spiraling through the sky about as fast as it would take a small airplane to fly across that much airspace.  If one side was the \"top\" of the disk, and one side \"the bottom,\u201d I must have seen the top and the bottom about 6 to 8 times each.  That is about how many rotations it made on its axis.  Its size was not determinable, and the altitude at which it was flying was also not determinable, so I cannot make any postulation as to any of those details.  I have never in my life believed in any sort of inexplicable flying objects of any sort.  I always thought that people that believed they saw UFO either had overactive imaginations or were just ignorant in terms of existing aircraft, or a combination of many other factors.  I do not wear glasses and I have perfect 20/20 eyesight in each eye. This was my first time ever seeing what in my mind, I guess, HAS to be a 'UFO', meaning there is no way I can explain what I saw based on my own first-hand experiences.  I have never believed in \"UFO's\" simply because I have never witnessed, first-hand, anything that I would qualify as such...there always seems to be an explanation (and there probably is one in my case, with my sighting this morning too!...I just don't have one right now!).  I always said that unless I see one myself (or a Sasquatch for that matter) I can't logically claim to believe in them.  This is my first ever 'UFO' sighting.  I even caught about 30 seconds of what I thought would be good footage using my cellular phone's video application...to no avail.  Immediately upon recording the sky, I could tell that there was nothing visible showing up on my phone's screen.  Nothing showed up during the recording process and there is nothing at all on the footage I have saved on my phone...just the hazy morning sky...no black spot, no nothing!....the object must have been too far away to register on my phone (a 2 Mega-pixel camera-phone).  That is all I have to report.  Conveniently, I am making this report here because I happened to see your website on TV; a History channel special on \"the grays\" which ran last night, and that is how I knew that this is the place to come if I ever needed to make a report.  Well, wouldn't you know it...the day after that is the day I have my first UFO sighting.",

I noticed a very bright high altitude object that looked to be a satallite at first, however, much brighter than I have seen satillites before and moving slower. I still thought nothing of it but watched it for the beauty of it. It then slowed in the sky and made a turn to the northeast. This caused me to give more attention. After about 10 secs more I noticed another smaller object following it at some distance. The smaller object tunrned to follow the same trajectory as the very bright object. Ive seen many satillites in my life and even saw the emrgency space shuttle re-entry landing that took place in California years ago. all I can say is that this was somewhat unusual due to size and 2 ufos with direction change.

It was odd... aircraft generally have one solid white light with a red and green on each side. There was no noise... just a white light that blinked steadily. It moved steadily across the sky, directly overhead, and moved behind some high, very thin clouds. At this point, it disappeared.  I stepped out into the front yard to scan the sky in the direction it was travelling.  It never reappeared! It travelled about the speed of a low-altitude plane, but was as high in the sky as a jetliner.   The light was brighter than a jet would be. Strange!   I have been a field investigator for 18 years. I've spent much of this time investigating Bigfoot reports for Oregonbigfoot.com, of which I am the director.  However, I've spent many years following up on UFO reports as well. I'm very aware of the appearance of planes and jets at all altitudes.  This did NOT have the appearance of those. I would add that there have been two occasions in the last few months that my research partner and I have been up near Oakridge, Oregon and have seen steady, bright white, soundless craft moving across the sky.  I captured these on film on one occasion.",

If you read the reports for Eugene/Springfield, Oregon, many people are reporting the same type of sighting.  These reports are spread across many months/years. I saw the UFO last night on a walk in west Eugene.   Was a bright light moving across the sky from west to east.  This was about 5 miles south of the Eugene airport and directly in the landing/takeoff path of aircraft from the airport.  If you look at a map of the airport you will see the main runway runs north to south, so this UFO crossed directly across the path of normal air traffic.  I haven't see an airplane ever move in an west to east pattern this close to the airport. Craft details.  I have no idea how to judge the height or speed of the UFO.  It was much too bright and moving to slow to be a satellite.  We did see satellite about 10 minutes after the UFO was gone for comparison.  The craft flew directly over head and was completely silent.  As it moved east, it finally sped up and was not visible any longer. About 30 minutes, we either saw the same UFO or one that looked exactly like it.  It was moving south to north at a rapid pace, but was far to the east of us.  An airplane with blinking light was moving in the opposite direction at the same time, but the UFO was much quicker and appeared to be at a much lower altitude. I also believe we saw this UFO on July 4th.  We were north of the Eugene Airport by 10 miles.  The light appeared to be south of the Airport and stopped hovered for about 10 minutes.  Then disappeared. I would assume this UFO is some sort of manmade device, but it is very hard to speculate on its speed and height as there is nothing to use as a reference.  It also does not follow the normal traffic pattern of aircraft that frequent the airport.",

      "story": "Five fiery lights/dark circular objects seen by young couple in Eugene, OR. It was about 8:50 p.m. on a Tuesday night, Tuesday the 27th of September 2011, when my fianc\u00e9 and I saw what looked like a ball of fire coming from the north, moving across the sky.  The night was mostly overcast with slightly orange tinted clouds, the wind was gently blowing from the north, and the temperature was about 60-65 degrees.  We were on our way to the store, walking up and around a nearby hill, in a mostly residential neighborhood, when it appeared. I at first thought it was just a brightly lighted plain or helicopter, but then noticed that the light seemed fire-like, red-orange-yellow, and slightly flickering.  There was no sound coming from it.  The next thing we noticed, for both my fianc\u00e9 and I were watching at this point, was that the fire/light seemed to be focusing towards the back of the craft, and then went out completely, about the time it passed over-head, though a little to the right from where we were standing.  And because the clouds were somewhat bright from the light pollution of the city, we both saw that, after the light had faded, there remained a small, dark, circular object.  At a distance it looked as small as a pupil, between an eighth and a quarter inch.  But there was no mistaking its flawless shape and its smooth edges. It was a perfect circle, black to my eyes, at least in the darkness.  Still silent, it continued on southward until we lost sight of it in the distance. Amazed, and a little frightened, we asked each other some typical questions, just to make sure we were both seeing the same thing as it was happening. \u201cCould you see it?   Did you see its shape?  I can\u2019t believe this!\u201d  Then, about 30 seconds later, from the same direction, another one appeared, as silent as the first.  It looked the same; fiery, moving southward, and its light also slowly receded towards the rear of the craft, and then went out, again, revealing a dark, round object beneath the clouds.   We both observed that the light went out about the same moment as the first, almost directly overhead of us, but to the right.  But unlike the first craft, which held a seemingly straight course, and remained dark, this one turned left and right in small, quick and smooth movements, and relit; just a flicker in the rear, fiery like before, only faint and small.  Then, the small light that reappeared seemed to move around the edge of the craft, in either direction, but never in a ful! l circle.  (I found this particularly strange, because I assume that a round craft would most likely spin to stay in flight, but the small light that reappeared did not.)  The light then seemed to go out again as the ship went further away into the distance. Almost as soon as we lost sight of the second craft, a third appeared.  Again, it came from the north and made its way south, looking just like the first two, and making no sound.  This one acted more like the second craft though, turning slightly, this way and that, and relighting after about 5-10 seconds of darkness, during which it was revealed as another round, dark object beneath the clouds.  The light that reappeared on this craft was small like the other, and also seemed to move around the edge of the dark circle it was attached to, but not in full circles. Before the third was even out of sight, the fourth appeared, just as the others had, and acted much like the second and third.   Each one was completely silent, all moving at what looked like the same speed, and in the same direction, taking about 25 seconds to cross from one edge of the sky to the other. Then, there was no more to be seen for what felt like 2-3 minutes, and we continued on to the store, watching the sky behind us. We were heading west.  After about 2 or 3 more minutes, we reached the store and went in.  The clock in the store said that it was almost 9:00 p.m. Coming out, we looked again towards the direction of the sighting, and saw the fifth and final craft. At this point we were surrounded by a bit more tree growth, and further away, so we didn\u2019t get a good look.  But we saw that it was plainly another light of the same color, moving in the same direction, and its light also seemed to extinguish, though we couldn\u2019t see if it came back or not. It was the first time either of us had seen anything like this, and as soon as we got home we start searching for the right people to talk to.",

When I first noticed it, it was stationary and I thought it might be a planet, though it appeared to me larger than I have ever known a planet to appear.  I observed this object in a stationary position for about 10 seconds.  As I watched, this object suddenly grew slightly larger with a flash of white light then immediately shrank down to the size of the surrounding stars.   As I kept my eye on it the small shape slowly begin moving upwards toward the zenith of the star field, faded away and was gone about 5 seconds after it started moving. About 10 minutes later I noticed two very large, bright white objects in the southern sky.  They appeared exactly as the first object did in brightness and size and they appeared to be about a hands width distance apart if I stretched my arm out in front of me.  They were positioned vertically to one another.   I watched them in this stationary position for about 10 seconds.  At that time they shrank down to the size of stars and then begin moving together toward the west very slowly.  They appeared to move together as one unit, keeping an equal distance apart as they moved.   They grew dimmer and disappeared about 5 seconds after they started moving.",

My girlfriend had been telling me ,a couple days before this ,that she had seen a UFO in the sky ,to the east of our house ,above the tree line.I did not pay too much attention to her ,until monday October 1st,2012 when i was watching tv and randomly looked out the window . I saw a light that caught my attention because it looked like an airplane but was not moving. I went outside on my deck and looked closer at this . It was a light that looked like a star ,but brighter,and seemed to have flickering red and green lights on it that told me it was a plane, but it was not moving anywhere.  I had a view of this between 2 trees and could tell it was not going anywhere,this light was west of my house above the treeline. As I am watching this light with my son ( 16 yrs .old ) ,  my girlfriend yelled at me that she can see another one on the other side of the house , to the east.We live outside Eugene, Oregon ,on a mountain, where there are no lights from the city ,m! aking the stars stand out with great brightness. We watched both of these lights for a while and only saw them move slightly up and down ,and side to side once in a while .  I got out my binoculars and could definately see flashing green and red lights and once in a while there was a dark ,almost purple blue light that was not constant, seemed to be random...... When I was watching the on to the west, I saw a bright flash of light close to the others that looked like maybe if you shined a realy bright light at something chrome or a mirror or something . This light never flashed again , that I saw . Ya know ,it was more like a flash of a camera, times 1000 !!!So that kinda weirded me out , but then last night Oct.2nd , we were at King Estates Winery for my birthday dinner,15 miles from our house and again on a mountain with no city lights, and there they were , in the same place as the night before !!!!!!!

It's not a star or satellite, apparently, because every few minutes it seems to randomly move about, sideways, back, up and down, in an erratic manner.  But essentially it is staying in the same location in the sky.  About a half hour before I noticed this, one of my dogs seemed highly agitated (unusual for her).  She's settled down now. I do live near an airport, but this object has been in the air for a long time now -- essentially hovering in place.... I just went back outside to check, and initially couldn't see the lights, then realized that it had traveled further north, and was now below the tree line from where we are.

They were about the size of Jupiter maybe slightly larger. I didn't automatically think UFO, I actually thought huh, a new street light?  It was hard to really stare and get a good look while driving but I tried and I realized that whatever it was, was not a street light.  I couldn't make out many details but this is what I observed: 5 or 6 bright white lights that were round, looked like stars and were about the size of jupiter maybe slightly larger.  There was one in the middle and I believe 5 that surrounded it. All the same size.  They reminded me of fireflies, they were not completely stationary but fluttering.  The ones on the outside were almost dancing around the middle one which stayed relatively still.  The other thing I noticed was that I couldn't really tell if they were close or far away.  Definitely closer than s! tars but much farther away than the trees but where exactly in-between those two was really hard to tell. Just a side note...i was skeptical to believe it was a ufo...i hear about these things all the time but to actually see one...  I drove the same streets the next night to see if there was in fact a new street light or any lights in the same spot and nothing.  Did anyone else see it?

This doesn't happen very often at all! I walked out the door to see what I could see, noticed the plane with red flashing lights.  It was going northwest and disappeared. As I was looking at the stars, I noticed an unusually bright object in the sky. At first I thought it was a plane because you could see it moving and appreared to be coming my way. Then it stopped. Red, yellow and blue lights were flashing from it as though it was a balled up rainbow. It would fade in and out of view. I ran to get binoculars and focusing in on it discovered there were two objects side by side. There was no moon shining at that time. I kept watching it by naked eye, then binoculars for approx. 5 minutes. I could barely make out the outline of a large fir tree so kept that in focus, as trees do not move. These objects kept moving.First  up and down then back and forth. They would also move away from ea! ch other, but always came back close again, Always colorful and flashing. They were very close together, but focusing on another star and keeping the binoculars very still, you could see them distance themselves then come back again closer to each other. At first they were to the left of the little dipper and the tree I had in focus. Then they gradually moved to the right of the little dipper and of the tree. I watched for over an hour till I called the local TV station. They recommended I videotape what I saw. My camcorder is broken so was not able to. They told me they would check it out. In the meantime, I got on FaceBook and found a friend that lives 5 miles from me. I explained what I seen, told her what area to look in and she seen the same things. I watched these objects for over 2 hours slowly going back and forth across the sky.All the while the lights kept flashing. Every couple of minutes they would fade away a tad, but then would be bright again. This was a very! clear sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD))",

It was a cloudly night and they didnot see them.  My compass said it was 63 degrees N.E.  They were much bigger then stars. They flashed and glided slowly, never losing formation.

As I got out of my car, I noticed a light moving relatively slowly, moving west or west southwest.  It caught my eye because the color was more orange than typical plane lights.  The speed seemed too slow for how low it appeared.   Then I began to notice the speed was slowing.  It didn't appear to turn, it just slowed until it came to a stop.  It remained stationary for 10 seconds or so, the began to fade until it just became dark.   I got a video of it on my phone, but it's just a small light that then turns off, no real detail visible.  At least it's proof that there was something there.  The night was very clear so I don't believe there was a cloud or something.  It is the only light in my video so it was the brightest light up there at the time.  I've never seen a flying object stop like that...then go dark?  Cool!",

What I saw looked like a giant snowflake (for lack of better way of describing it) and it had pulsing lights all over the front of it!  The pulsing lights were in vertical sections, with one section coming on really bright and then fading, while the section next to it came on very bright.  The sections alternated like that all across the front of it. This thing was traveling through the sky at a slow speed and I think it was near the Eugene airport.   After I watch it for about 30 seconds, it suddenly divided and became two rounds things of pulsing lights.  They kept traveling through the sky at a slow speed, keeping a uniform distance between them.  After about another 30 seconds, they went behind some trees and I lost sight of them.   Two vehicles were pulled off the road in strange places and no doubt the drivers had seen this also.   I did not have a camera with me and that taught me to always have one with me in the future, as I never know what I may see!

At first I thought they were fireworks gone awry and waited for them to explode.  Neither of them did.  That attracted my attention as being odd.  One was above the other.  After about 3 minutes first one then the other faded and disappeared several miles southward.   Went out an hour later (at 0:54) to have a smoke and saw a red light come from the west from the direction of Florence, Oregon followed by 6 others.  As they traveled in my direction, they all appeared to be moving very fast. They appeared to be traveling high above the oregon coast mountain range.  I have always watched the weather coming in from the coast ( we live 60 miles inland) and have a pretty good idea of what the weather is going to do here in the Willamette valley based on my observations of cloud activity wes! t of us.  I've seen a lot of jets in the area but none of them flies from that direction or that fast.  All of the red lights disappeared at the same point several miles toward the south.  All of them followed the exact same trajectory and faded quickly and disappeared at the same point in the sky. I have lived less than 2 miles from the Eugene airport for the past 23 years.  I have seen private airplanes, private jets, commercial jets, cargo jets, navy sub killer aircraft conducting touch and go training flights, and a wide variety of military jets taking off after re-fueling on north to south trajectories.  I know all of the trajectories for all of the aircraft that fly over or around my home and, at times, what time of day I can expect to see particular airlines.  I am can distinguish the difference between night time aircraft lights and landing lights between fixed wing and jet aircraft.  I also know the sound that all of them make.   Tonight I neither heard nor saw anything I have ever experienced.  There were none of the usual stro! bing lig hts, throbbing engine sounds, or jet sounds.  I have also seen military jets climbing at night.  Their after burners have never looked red.  What I saw and heard were bright red lights that fluctuated minimally and felt, but did not hear, a slight bass hum.    Conditions were clear, 23 degrees F, no clouds, and a bright half moon in the sky.  I have never seen any thing like this in my 55 years on the planet.",

The color almost looked like the distant glow from a fire but was floating in the sky.  They flickered with intensity and flew in unison with one another.  They appeared to be very low and slow moving.  They were traveling north then turned northwest.  One orb started to go dim almost to the point where it looked like a star then disappeared then the other orb just disappeared.  This was not the first time we have seem this kind of activity before.  A month before in November of 2014 we saw a single orange orb that we wrote off as a balloon with a candle attached to.  The second even was the same kind of orb with the glowing orange fire like light but was in a pair.   We live close enough to the airport to see the planes come and go on a regular bases but these flying objects were different from anything we have seen before.  Regular air traffic generates a lot of noise pollution these c! rafts were silent.  We find this event and the past event very strange but don't feel threatened by the presences.

I live with my grown son in a trailer park, and I am very religious.  On June 30th, 2015, a little after 9pm,  I was standing outside my trailer to see the bright \"star\" of Jupiter and Venus together, which many have called the star of Bethlehem.  I waved for my neighbor to come off her porch and see.  We looked together for a minute toward the west, talking about how it has not happened in 2000 years since Jesus was born. I turned to go back to my home and she said, \"What is that?\"  I looked above my trailer in the sky and saw what seemed to be an invisible rectangular object with four sets of blue and red paired lights beneath it.  The bright blue and red lights were paired together in four places like where the wheels would be under a car.  We did not see the rectangle object, only the lights.  These were large lights, not tiny pin-sized lights. They did not blink, only glowed cobalt blue and bright red very vividly.  At first it was just hovering, then it went up, away south, around and back again and that is when I realized it was not a helicopter.  Nothing could travel or turn that fast that I have ever seen before. We watched until it went up and disappeared into the east. I had a strange feeling while watching that it had been looking at the stars as well, knew we were looking at it, and was trying to get away from us.  I don't know if that is true, it is just a sense I had.  I did not feel afraid, just calm and curious.  I brushed it off, since someone I later spoke with said it was probably a drone.  But after thinking about it, this was too big to be a drone, and much too fast.",

One of my photos was zoomed into Autzen Stadium (Ducks) the others were of the downtown area.  There was quite a bit of haze from lingering fires on the horizon which made it difficult to take any quality photos. About an hour later I was viewing on my PC when I saw a disk \u2013 UFO \u2013 pretty clearly over and past the stadium.  I did not see or was aware of this object whatsoever when I took the picture. My camera is a new Sony Cybershot DSC-HX90V.  I had the zoom almost all the way out but was still able to capture a freeze shot at 1/320 of a second.  I was fortunate to have it on Program Auto mode with the ISO set to 80.  I used Cyberlink Photo Director to clean up the image by increasing the contrast and edging effect some.  With those simple adjustments it becomes quite obvious I have captured a large Saucer Disk.  You can use the cell tower to get an impression of the size as it is beyond that.

An orange solid very bright oval object crossed through the window just to the right of my TV view screen.  The window is located in my vaulted area of me ceiling above my front door. When I saw it I was awe struck with the size and orange brightness as it progressed to the right side of my window.  A few moments later, another Bright orange same size solid object came into view in line.  I jumped up went outside.  There they were.  Suddenly, a third was in view from the East coming in my direction.   I ran back inside and grabbed my wife out of bed.  We both saw the third and then a fourth.  They seemed to be in formation.  As they got closer they began to go towards the right or South.  As they moved silently, I noticed there was no sound.  I also looked for wind.  It was a perfect dusk night.  No wind.  No sound.  Just more lights.   I told my wife to go back inside and grab her cell.  At first she could not see anything on the cell display.  She handed me the phone and I held it up into the sky at the objects regardless and pushed the button in hope it might see something. The photo is included with this report.  Unfortunately, the image does not show a very clear shot.  The good news is there is a tree, house, low small cloud in the image for comparison. I went back in the house as the objects disappeared towards the right into the trees. A put on my pants and went back out just in case.  Who knows, perhaps they would circle around?  My neighbor was coming around the corner in his car.  He asked if I saw some -thing?  Told him hell ya.  He said he say them also and his daughter also saw them from the house.",

      "story": "Saw triangle shaped craft with some kind of cloaking. I am a veteran of the military and an amateur astronomer so I am pretty good at aircraft identifications and where lights should be in the sky.  Last night, 09/25/2016, at approximately 20:15 I saw what looked to be a triangle shaped craft over the city of Eugene, Oregon. I had just stepped out on my balcony for a smoke and sat down in my chair facing East overlooking most of NE Eugene and N Springfield.  Looking in the sky above and well beyond the neighbor's house at the sight line of the power lines I saw 3 orange lights equidistant apart and in a triangle.  It occurred to me that there shouldn't be bright stars in the sky in that area that time of night and time of year so I\u00a0 looked closer. As I\u00a0 looked closer, I saw the bottom most of the lights moving and then I thought to myself:  that makes sense it is commercial aviation.  So I looked back at the other 2 lights and saw they were moving together too and that it was one triangle shaped craft rotating on its center axis.  All the while I\u00a0noticed the bright orange lights were shining through what looked like heat shimmer coming off the desert floor. Very much like a scene from the movie, \"Predator,\" the \"cloaking\" around it wavered for just a brief second and when it did I saw a large triangle shaped craft with smooth sides and a smooth metallic bottom with a smaller circular abutment in the center with a light bluish glow.  The craft stopped rotating and it looked like a harrier jet pulling up its nose on a vertical takeoff and then it disappeared.  It did leave but as it was leaving the \"cloaking\" kicked back in and it disappeared from sight. Like something out of the X files 2 helicopters showed up within 30 seconds of the object disappearing.  Eugene is a small city and helicopters are fairly rare here with just a couple of overflights a day but these stayed on station for the better part of an hour circling over the Eugene/Springfield area.",

At first I thought it was a big meteor entering the atmosphere, but as I looked, it appeared to be about 500 feet up, and about 1/2 mile away, and about the size of a small business jet.  It had a brilliant white ball of light at the front, and a 3 or 4 panel-like \"tail\" sections attached to it.  The sections were distinct from each other, they were iridescent radiant colors in red, green, and blue and were roughly 6 times the length of the \"head\".  It traveled smoothly from south to north, silent, and very steady.  It looked very similar in shape to the Teston (Kent), UK/England, sighting of Saturday, August 13, 2016.

This is a correction to my submission last night.  There were 2 witnesses (1 partial) and 1 craft, instead of 1 witness and 2 craft. I've also included my email address this time around. I was sitting in a lawn chair looking up in the night sky not long after dark, when I spotted what I thought was a satellite to the east of me.  I noted that it was about the same brightness as the surrounding stars except that it was moving across the sky at the speed of the usual satellite in a SW direction.  When it was aligned in front of and above me, at about 95-100 degrees, it appeared to suddenly shoot straight down towards me at a high rate of speed growing larger and brighter (bright white) the closer it came, maybe to about 10x the size it had been, not any larger than a dime. I thought to myself that if it continued in that direction it might hit me.  Then about \u00bd way down it suddenly reversed direction and went back up to the approximate altitude that it had been, continuing on its course in approximately the same SW direction.

We were on Pre's (Prefontaine's) Trail, right next to Interstate 5 and the Patterson Slough, a canal that runs through the park.  It was a very clear sunny day and there was a University of Oregon game going on nearby at Autzen Stadium.   An airplane was flying overhead with a banner trailing it, like they often do on game days.  I stopped to bring up the video recorder on my phone because I was having a hard time reading the sign and wanted to blow up the image.  My husband asked me what I was doing and you'll hear him in the video saying, \"Coors Light,\" because he could read it (without being a dork like me and video recording it).  You can also hear someone else yell \"woah\" in the background, and I am not sure what that is about.   It wasn't until much later that I was watching videos on my phone that I noticed something come into the frame of the video in the upper corner by the plane and flash by.  It's moving at a very fast speed and seems to be fairly low in the sky.  What is crazy to me is it looks disc shaped, or partially disc and cylinder shaped, when you zoom in on it.  There were no other engine sounds other than the low flying airplane with the banner.   I'm interested to know if others think this is a UFO, or if there are any other logical explanations for the object.",

It seemed odd because it was not high in the sky from my point of view and because it was a very clear bright light and there were no other stars visible in the sky.

The light was in the distance but just above the horizon of the building from my point of view. I don't believe it was close at all since it just appeared like a very bright star in the sky at sundown. The light remained stationary, I asked the person next to me to look at the light.  They first thought it was a light from a building very far away since it was a very bright white light, sort of the type you would see on Tall building Radios. I told them that it was not because we don't have those types of tall buildings in our city. They then just said at it in confusion. There were no sounds of helicopters around and there were no other lights around it, something a helicopter might have. ( red and white )  It did not move and stayed in the same position.  After a few minutes, It suddenly began to dim. and then the light was gone just before the sun completely went down.  The Dim of the light lasted about 10 seconds before it completely went out.

Why would a drone need such a powerful light when there was still light out? and Don't most LED lights go off suddenly?  rather than a 10 second fade away?  the light did not seem near, appeared to be very far away like a star.",

On July 17, 2017, at approximately 7:00 PM Pacific Time, my wife and I were driving South on Lorane Hwy in Eugene, OR.  As we passed the Andrew Reasoner Wildlife Preserve, we observed to the North what appeared to be a commercial jetliner hovering over the hill, approximately one quarter mile from our position on the road, and maybe 500 feet off the ground.  My wife noticed it first and exclaimed, \u201cLook at that.  That\u2019s not moving at all.\u201d  My wife was convinced it was tethered to the ground, like a dirigible.   As the driver, I was initially focused on the road, but was able to turn my head left and see the plane for about 15 seconds and it did not appear to be moving.  I tried to convince myself that it was, just flying very slowly, but I saw nothing to indicate it was changing position.   The plane was extremely low; from our vantage point, we could almost see the tops of the wing surface and we could easily see the color scheme on the side of the plane (a flash of orange writing on a white fuselage).  Considering the Eugene airport is miles away to the North, and the plane was traveling, or hanging, East to West, I find no rational explanation as to why a giant commercial jetliner would be frozen, or possibly moving at a speed slower than our car.   Although I\u2019m relaying this as if we cognized everything immediately, it wasn\u2019t until we rounded the next corner and the \u201cplane\u201d left our sight that we realized how incredibly odd what we had just witnessed was.   We immediately turned the car around and were back where we first saw the plane in less than 30 seconds.  It was gone and although we had a clear view all the way to the horizon--West, North and South--we could find no trace of the \u201cplane\u201d in our view.   We couldn\u2019t see clearly to the East, but it would have been impossible for the plane to head in that direction from the position it was in when it left our view and no chance we wouldn\u2019t have seen it if it was even possible for it to instantaneously turn around.   Considering the proximity of the \u201cplane\u201d to our car, we should have heard the sounds of the plane's engines, but there was only the noise of our tires on the road.  The plane made no sound and didn\u2019t show any exhaust gases.   We both are well- familiar with the area and have never seen a commercial airliner flying so low, let alone at walking speed, if not completely frozen.  It was one of the oddest things either one of us has ever experienced.",

I saw behind a tree about 60 feet above was a lit up long flat disc shaped object. It hovered there for about a minute then procceded to move slowly along the row of trees getting higher and higher.  About 50 feet away it got lower and made a simaler sound to a boom of thunder and then it got lower and lower and zoomed off in the distance.  This took about 3 minutes then it was gone. Description of object: it lit up along the whole bottom edge.  The shape was like a flat disc and was ginormous and long.  Its pace had no stops and went smoothly.  When it was hovering it was still and the lights seemed dimmer than when it started to move. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "My neighbor and I were standing in front of my garage talking, about 10:45pm, Saturday night, March 31st, when I looked up about 60deg up WNW above the trees across the street and noticed a bright white flash about -4.0mag.  Thinking it was possibly the ISS coming over, I told my neighbor to look also, but about 4 seconds later, we saw a much smaller flash about 2.0mag followed 6 seconds later by another brighter flash as the object moved very slowly from WNW toward the E. I went inside and grabbed binoculars while my neighbor tried to capture it on his Android phone. When I looked at it through the binoculars I realized it was actually two objects!  One following the other and both flashing at irregular intervals.  After watching them move slowly across the sky, the brighter one suddenly TURNED SOUTH, continuing to flash every 6-12 seconds for about 30 secs before disappearing. Never seen anything like that happen before. The dimmer object continued E also flashing at odd intervals until it moved past 90deg above us and began quickly fading as if it was going into the earths shadow. First thought was it might have been the Tiangong-1 space station, but a quick check online showed it nowhere near our latitude. A check of the satellite databases showed no objects matching the magnitude, altitude or azimuth observed for the time frame. Whatever they were they appeared to be very high altitude, possibly tumbling and moving very, very slowly compared to satellites or aircraft. Observer #1 has been an astro-imager and satellite tracker for 15yrs+, an aviation enthusiast for over 40 yrs, and has seen a lot of strange looking, but easily explainable, things in the sky.  These were VERY odd objects indeed!!   Observer #2 has had one other observation of different unknown objects 3 1/2 years ago about 2 miles from this location. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly tumbling space debris, giving off intermittent reflections of the Sun??  PD))",

      "story": "I saw a something appear in the sky out of nowhere and shoot off across the sky like a comet that disappeared into clouds rumbling I was on my driveway in the River Road area of Eugene Oregon teaching a martial arts lesson to a private student at night. The object was probably flying overhead around 6:30pm or later but not after 7pm. I saw a flash of light that remained consistent for about 2 seconds then disappeared flying in 1 direction headed into some clouds and disappeared. It did not come out the other end of clouds. It was as if the craft sped up and shot some fire/light out and looked almost like it could have been a close falling star or meteor. I heard a very quiet rumble and it was almost silent. I said \u201cWhat is that?\u201d And my student then looked up and saw it too. She would not have noticed unless I said something. The reason I saw it was because I saw it out of my peripheral vision above as it shot very fast into the clouds. It came from an area of no clouds heading west and flew in a dart of light into some dark clouds and disappeared. I did not see it come out anywhere else. The entire event could not have lasted more than 2 seconds. I think I may have seen a stream of smoke or a trail out like a comet or a jet stream that only started from when I saw the flash until it went into the clouds. I was not sure if the shape was a ball or a dart shape. It may have been a military jet that was silent and doing night flying. I am not sure what it was. It was very fast and before it flash! ed it was completely silent and undetectable by sound or even sight. Like it appeared in the sky and flew fast like a comet and went into a cloud and disappeared. And yes it was way lower than any meteorite but way higher than a typical airplane flies and way faster than any commercial jet flying. I am 37 years old and college educated and a martial arts teacher.  My student is 45 years old and a mother and grandmother and married.  She works as a phlebotomist at a local hospital and is also educated.",

      "story": "3 lights in a triangular formation, disappeared after getting out of car There was 1 UFO, seemingly above Spencer's butte, a local hiking spot. I was driving and noticed it, it was brighter than the brightest star/planet would be at that time of day, and moving slower than a satellite. It was also not blinking like an airplane. I was driving home, and the object seemed to continue to rise from the butte and come closer to me.  As I kept driving, I could see more of it.  I slowed down and squinted, and saw that it was 3 bright white lights in a triangular shape.  I was close to home so I sped up into my driveway, got out, and it was gone.  I scanned the entire sky, nothing to be seen.",
