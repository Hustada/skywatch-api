Myself and my mother her sister and daughter was watching tv waiting for the news to come on, at 2200 hrs watching wffa channel 8 news the reporter said, \"Folks, if you want to see something amazing go out side and look over the Dallas skyline\" which we did as well as most of the block. What we all saw was three objects looked like the size of a golf balls\u00a0from about 9 miles from Dallas texas looking east.  At about a 1000 to 1500 feet above Dallas.  These objects was stationery each emitting different colors like blue gold red green silver.  It was rather superb looking.  After just standing there for about a minute each one started to do bizzar monuvers\u00a0like one was zigzaging the other one was going up then down zipping from on side of the sky back and forth with the other two, at on point they formed a close circle and went spinning around at very fast speed. This lasted for about 3 min.  When the US Navy put a halt to the airshow\u00a0as they scrambled two F-8 crusaders which at that time was hot alert aircraft, which ment they was armed with the sidewinder missile, along with the 50.cal guns.  They flew from NAS Hensley field out side of Dallas on the southwest just about 6 miles away, it only took about 20 seconds from the time they took off to get\u00a0 over Dallas.  (I seen them as they left the air station only 3 miles away) never will forget how loud they was in full afterburner,  Just before they got on station, the three objects shot straight up in the night sky in a split second.  The F-8s made a few passes over Dallas before returning to there base. This left me with a impression that the ufos wanted to show the people what they could do, I know aircraft and it was nothing\u00a0 that any aircraft or helicopter could do. Not only did my family see this but was reported by was channel 8 news along with hundreds of people I will say on thing this report is not a hoax I seen other sightings as well but none as this one.",

      "story": "The hi-pitches noise is what first alerted me to the disk. My family was watching t.v when the t.v started static and picture problems. The lights started blinking from dim to bright.My dogs were whining and scratching the back door wildly.Keep in mind my German sheperd had been qaurentine twice for biting people riding or walking ddown the alley.As well as a mean standard poodle. I went to let them in the house and when I opened the door they ran me over peeing and pooping as they crossed over me.The noise was very hi-pitched.I was 13 yrs old.My first reaction was to run where they did under my bed. I went as far as the bed room and ran back to lookfor my mom and brother. The front door was opened and I went to the porch and our neighbors and my mom and brother were all looking in the sky. I looked up and saw a huge disk shape houvering above the neighbor hood. It was so huge it could have destroyed at least two blocks if it landed. Now it gets even stranger.It is dark outside the sky is just a shade of dk blue but not quite black. The ship is almost the same color or a shade just lighter from the color of the sky. I'm histerical and run in the room where my dogs are. I grab the phone to call police,my dad anyone because I'm scared but remember I have to go getmy mom and little brother. The sound of the ship is head jolting. I ran to get my mom and brother in the house but they just stair in the sky. I grab my neighbor hand and tell her to run. But could'nt budge her. I ran back to the porch behind the bushes surrounding the porch and look up in ahh. I notice that it is round in shape like a washer that goes on a screw then criss-crossing are bars that connect to the center of the disk which is like a black smoke-glass sphere. It didn't have windows and I would have to guess maybe that the center was like a smoke glass marble and they were watching us. Anyway, the outer part begin to have lights red,green,yellow,blue four in a row from my angle i could see blinking at the front side and back of the ship. They blinked in a harmony like way. Then as it went higher u in the sky it's shape seemed to change and the criss-cross bars went in and the disk was smaaler in size and it went up and shot ahead in the sky so fast it was gone. I ran out into the yard where everyone seem to be calm and alert. I was screaming did you see it lets call someone. And mom said calm down it's time for bed. Pat the neighbor was telling every one good night. I was alarmed that everyone was so calm and non-shalaunt about the situation.The next day my mom the neighbors all of them said they didn't remember seeing anything last night. But they couldn't explain why my legs were all scratched up from the dogs running me over in the kitchen and the back door being almost scratched in too from the dogs. I've told this story to every one I know and they just look at me like I crazy. And as god is my witness, I've been when three of them and together they witnessed again another ufo sighting. Do they keep an eye on you once you spot one of them. I've never seen a allien, but I  have seen at least three other ships since I have seen that one at 13. One had three lights and was triangle shape, one just a blue sphere never loosing altitude and traveled in a perfectly straight direction. and yet another like jacks shaped. You know the jacks and ball little girls played as a child. With light on all five ends. They were at close distances and was also a bit over whelming even as I am now a adult. I had the same fear rush threw me as I did as the 13 year old girl who seen the mother of all ships. Nothing has ever come close to the sighting I seen at the house in Dallas,Tx. Whats even stranger is..... Since 1998 I have had a series of dreams.That seem to be messages from alliens. They were very clear and in color that was so bright. Over a two year period I had five that were so real. I have to question if they are related. One thing I am clear on is this. Somethings out there.",

      "story": "My UFO sighting over the Immigration Rally in Dallas, Tx. It was all in the Immigration Rally in Dallas Texas on April 9th 2006 at around 13:30. Me and one of the people i was marching with saw this strange object changing shapes in the sky. We didnt know what the object was. We just saw it as a ballon or something. I jokingly said, \"look, bro , a ufo!\" we had a little laugh, not thinking anything of it. But the reason I am bringing it up now is because i was just curiusly looking at ufo pictures on the net (10/06/2006), and it was a ufo that looked exactly like what we saw on that day. I was overwhelmed when I saw the picture, and I immediately thought that some research area might want to know. It was a white cigarrette-like shape, except it moved around, and it seemed to make movements as if it was weightless (thats why we thought it was a balloon at first). It seemed to move like if it had no weight, like if the air was making it move. It was pretty high in the air, probably the elevation that a airplane would fly. The object didnt really seem to move location, it was just like standing still, like if it was just observing how the 300 thousand+ people were marching. At times the object would look like a horizontal cigarrette, and at times it looked like a bomerang like shape. It didnt seem like if it was changing elevation, just the movement of the object. Like I said before, I've held this in for about 6 months because i just thought of it as a balloon. The pictures I'm going to send are not from the Immigration Rally, but they're from some couple in Los Angeles. But the pictures are not of something that somewhat looks like what I saw, but they ARE OF WHAT I SAW, the SAME EXACT THING. In the pictures you can clearly see what im talking about when I said that the object changed shapes. Again these pictures are not mine, they were taken by a couple in Los Angeles. If ya'll have any question to ask me, please feel free to contact me by e-mail only at a_zenon08@yahoo.com . thanks for taking time to read my report. I hope it is to some help to! you guy s.  p.s.- has anyone else from Dallas reported you about this similar object?",

It seemed to either be a translucent dark color, or to reflect the surrounding clouds, which led to it looking 'ghostly'. It seemed pretty large. I'm bad at estimating altitudes, but we're on the direct flight path to the Dallas/Love Field airport which is only about 4 miles away so airplanes fly pretty low overhead (maybe 300ft). This object appeared to only be 2 or 3 times as high; it was roughly the size of a quarter held at arm's length when it disappeared (possibly into the clouds). It was also traveling pretty fast.

      "story": "Its bottom appeared as three dimly illuminated elongated octagons, one in front of two in tandem. 8/13/07 UFO Sighting, Dallas, Texas  On Monday morning, August thirteenth of 2007, I was lying on my back on a lawn lounger cushion up on top of my carport about midnight, prepared to spend the next five hours watching the second night of the meteorite shower.  I had a cut-out cardboard box around my head to block out the street & residential security lights in the neighborhood, making my view of the clear but hazey sky quite clear.  I had laid there admiring shooting stars when at about 12:25 AM a small airplane flew North over me in Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas, Texas.  Its North-South trajectory was about a few blocks to the West of my position.  I imagine it to have been following the path of Westmoreland Boulevard.  Before I could see it, I remembered the noisey little airplane by its distinctive sound, since it flies North and/or South over our house frequently at night, always disturbing my sleep.  It triggered the usual question: why aren't such airplanes required to muffle their noise, especially at night?  As it passed over my line of sight, I noticed something following it.  I first thought the plane was towing something behind it, because the object behind the airplane was traveling the same speed and at approximately the same altitude.  It was so dimly illuminated it was hard to see.  It's image area was about six to eight times larger than the small airplane's image area.  All I could see of it was three elongated octagons (rectangles with the corners cut off).  Their lengths ran the direction the craft traveled.  The octagons were in a common plane, two in the back and one in center front, evenly spaced apart in a triangular formation.  It was about one to two hundred yards behind the small airplane and slightly to the West of the airplane's trajectory.  It flew in a straight, level line without deviations.  Either the small airplane was making so much noise that I couldn't discerne the object's sound.  Or, the object was making no noise at all.  The object's three elongated octagonal panels were either very dimly: but evenly illuminated, or they were finished with a non-reflective or ultra-flat coating that evenly diffused their reflection of the city's ground lights over their surfaces.  No sharp ground lights were reflected off of them as it passed over.  And, I don't know if it was a single craft or three individual aircrafts flying in continuous and perfect formation.  I stood and turned around to continue watching it and the airplane as they flew away from me, to the North toward Love Field.  As they dissappeared in the misty distance I couldn't descerne anything about the object's shape.  As the three panels became flat in the distance, the whole thing seemed to dissappear.  But, I could still see the airplane's blinking lights and barely still hear the airplane's noisey exhaust.  I immediately went downstairs to write down and sketch what I'd seen.  Just after one o'clock I called Love Field Tower.  A recording gave me a night phone number.  I called that number at 1:10 AM.  Someone named Gary answered the phone.  I briefly described what I'd seen.  He said he was on the field and to call him back in twenty minutes when he'd be back in his office.  I called him again at 1:30 AM and again told him what I'd seen.  He said he'd talked to the tower and they'd heard nothing from anyone else about it.  I reminded him that the tower's nightn phone number isn't even listed, so the public couldn't have called the tower unless it was a relative or other airport official who already knew the tower's night number, deducing that HE would be the only one to have recieved any calls about it.  He completely ignored that.  It seemed as though he was partonizing or attempting to placate me.  He didn't seem genuinely interested, failing to ask for my name, phone number or any information about the sighting that I hadn't volunteered.  I asked him if there is an official phone number where such sightings are supposed to be reported.  He said, \"No,\" that I'd \"called the right number.\"  So, I appologized for bothering him with such ridiculous nonsense and hung up.  I was left feeling disgruntled, unsatisfied and embarrassed.  Now, that I know the National UFO Reporting Center is listed in the FAA Manual as the correct place to report unusual sky sightings, I'll call ole \"doubting Gary\" back tonight to provide him with the NUFOREC's phone number, remind him to read his manual and give him a free piece of my mind.  I saw a similarly unusual flying object many years ago (I'm bad with past chronology) several miles East of Tyler, Texas.  It was deep in the dark piney East Texas forrest.  The night was clear and the stars were amazingly bright.  The thing appeared to be a sharp triangle, only distinguished by it's blocking out the star's light behind it as it passed over me heading East.  It was moving too slowly, in my opinion, to be an airplane.  It didn't exhibit the three elongated octagonal shapes on the bottom.  If it was the same type craft, I suppose this was because there was no ground light to illuminate them.  It was exactly the same color and intensity of the background night sky.  It, too, made absolutely no sound.  And, I was alone then, too.   I seriously doubt these craft were man-made.  And, I no longer have any doubts that we are NOT alone on our God-forsaken, bloodthursty, demockery-cursed, predatory little planet.  So, perhaps there is hope for Us good Earthlings, afterall!",

      "story": "Large cigar shaped metalic flying object I'm a retired xxx Airlines 777 Captain and former USAF Search & Rescue Pilot.  I thought you might be interested sightings I've had during my carrier?   In the early 1980's, I was flying as Captain on an MD80 from DFW to DEN.  Our departure time was approximately 8:00 pm, hazy, but with partial light still in the sky.  Climbing out of DFW on an initial 185 degree heading, and just passing through approximately 1,000' AGL (above the ground), I spotted a very large object out of the copilots window.  I immediately made the statement to my copilot, \"What the @#*! is that?\"  It appeared to be elongated and \"cigar\" shaped, a grey metallic looking object, moving very slowing from right to left (west to east), and it appeared to have many small, dark, and slightly fuzzy looking, rectangular \"windows\" running longitudinally along the length of the object; a line or band of windows?  I immediately called departure control on the radio and asked, \"Departure, do you show anything ahead of us on radar\".  He replied, \"No, why do you ask?\"  I told him I wasn't sure but that we thought that there was an object out ahead of us.  At first seeing the object, which was initially located in the right third of my copilots window from my viewpoint, I thought that it might be the undercarriage of a 747.  The object appeared to be moving very slowly.  However, as we accelerated on climb out, the object did not appear to be changing in size indicating that we were not going to have an immediate collision.  I had seen mirages many times before in the past, and so I initially thought that this might be a mirage.  Because of the hazy sky conditions, moisture in the air, and dusk, it didn\u2019t appear to be a mirage, but still a possibility.  As we climbed out of 4500\u2019, the object was now leaving us toward the east but still visible in the left third of my windscreen when departure had us turn to the northwest on our way toward Denver.  I didn\u2019t think much of the incident until years later when I happened to turn the television on during one of my layovers.  The program, \"In Search Of\" was on and this particular segment was about a sighting over Montreal (Torronto?), Canada.  In that program, several hundred witnesses described exactly what my copilot and I had seen on our departure out of DFW during the same time period.  The announcer stated that through triangulation, the objects length was determined to be 6,000\u2019 long.  That\u2019s a mile long and would explain why it appeared that we were not closing on the object we saw!  I thought my sighting above might have some interest for your research?  Other pilot friends have had different encounters.  Back in 1979, I was flying with one 707 pilot and he told me that during a nighttime letdown approach into LAX, when still east of Palm Springs, California, he and his Captain had to take evasive action in order to avoid hitting another flying object.  As they pulled back on the stick to avoid colliding with their \u201cUFO\u201d, they could clearly see inside the \u201ccockpit\u201d of this craft and clearly saw the \u201cpilots\u201d.  Both of the American pilots were former USAF pilots and they both knew what oxygen masks looked like, the type worn by military pilots.  What they saw on the \u201cUFO pilots\u201d face(s), helmet or oxygen masks, they said was nothing they had ever seen before.  In their estimate, it was not of this planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We have encouraged the source to try to determine the exact date, using his flight logs.  Also, we have requested that he have the other pilots submit reports, as well.  PD))",

Toward the end of October my fiance & I had been seeing odd things in the sky a lot. we tend to be night owls and we would go walking between midnight and 4am regularly.  She lived with her sister at that point & a new subdivision was being built about 500 yards down from their house.  Over this new sub we regularly saw lights and strange shapes darting about. As we were walking down the street (Benson rd) we saw a disc shaped object approximately a quarter mile ahead of us and probably around 10,000 feet up  It seemed to spin, and white lights shining from it began to blur as it spun around.  We kept walking and it appeared to follow us as we walked.  This all tripped me out due to the fact i was a new believer in UFOs, but she wasn't intimidated by the craft. she decided to blink her flashlight at it to see what would happen. after flashing the light at it, the craft fired off blue, green, and red flares in the same pattern as the light blinked.  We continued our walk, occasionally shining the light skyward with the same results as before.  The craft would also follow the light if we moved the light around. As we headed back to the house, we shone the lights skyward again, illuminating the craft once more.  Suddenly the lights died, and it was not batteries dying.  Both light had freshly charged batteries before we left the house.  As we walked back, we kept looking  back to see the craft following us.  I cannot remember what the neighbors dogs were doing, but it was likely not their typical come out and challenge us behavior.  The craft had followed us all the way back and as it was over the neighbors house, my fiance  felt as if she was shaking or having a seizure.  As we got into the front yard, she suddenly collapsed to the ground.  I helped her to her feet and we went inside.  A final look out the front door showed the craft hovering above the front porch.

I stand from this computer and desk, then walk to my home office door. I open the door, step out into the cold night.  I look up, and oh my God... maybe 300 ft DIRECTLY above my head is a triangular craft. I have such anxiety as I write this. The craft was maybe 150' wide along edge. It clearly traveled forward along one point of the triangle.  All edges were rounded and smooth. NO SOUND.  The bottom of the craft was clearly visable to me.  It had 3 large domes at the corners of the triangle that were glowing a steady amber light.  In the center of the craft was a larger dome that had antenas and other fixtures, that extended down from it.  The longest, and most centered of the extentions had a smooth pulsing red strobe.  The craft had no distinct color other than a metalic dark grey. It moved at about 15 to 20 mph, slow and steady in a SouthWest direction.  The craft seemed to be surveling and mapping, this is just a hunch.  I live in flight paths of two major airports, DFW and Dallas Love Field.  I could not help but notice that there were NO airplanes in the air. The nite was clear and crisp with N/W wind gusts.  I had an unobstructed view of the whole event for approximatly one minute and a half.  For the first 15 to 20 seconds, I was struck dumb with awe not even blinking.  Take a picture I quickly thought.  As I rushed in my office, completely confused as to the logical whereabouts of my family camera, I rumaged through my shelves and grabbed a pair of binoculars.  I stood on my diving board, and at 17x mag. I watched it float off over distant house and treetops toward downtown Dallas. For the record, I am not crazy, although this event has tested every limit of my logical capacity.  I sat in true shock, shivering on my couch wearing my bathrobe trying to calm down for the first 15 minutes after.  I dont understand why I was allowed to witness it or them.  I did not roboticaly move on command or anything like that, however I was asked or encouraged to see.  I just dont know how else to explain that part of the experience.",

The sight is very close to a landing path to a local airport and this craft is too high for aircraft in this particular area.  As I started to focus on the glint, I realized the craft just went up in the air about 5000 more feet and then third second, it was gone.  The craft when it went up in altitude did not move forward to go up, it just went \"backward\" from me, meaning it just went up in the sky in unbelievable speed with no sound and within 2 seconds, it was gone.  It never moved forward another foot from where it was when it was when I first saw it.    there was no wings or tail or any marking except it was grey metallic color in a cigar long shape.

It appeared to be hovering but was moving slightly vertically, and horizontally. I watched it for 5 minutes, and then called my neighbor to witness what I saw.  She saw it as well, and said I should report it. I called 911 and they connected me to the UFO Center.  I reported the incident to Mr Peter Davenport, who asked that I write this narrative. I also reported it to WFAA TV...the ABC Affiliate in Dallas.  They said no other sightings had been reported to them.  While still viewing the object after 10 minutes, other American aircraft were flying around, over, and beneath the object. The American aircraft appeared to be military jets because there were smoke trails coming from the back of the crafts.  There were also domestic aircraft flying which looked MUCH smaller than the UFO, and I assume they were flying their regular routes.  I went inside to get my binoculars...and through them I could see the object much better. There appeared to be an orange color on the bottom of the craft. I called my mother, who lives 6 miles away from me, and she saw the disc as well.  I have enclosed pictures of the craft.  I cropped 1 of the pictures...and I left the other 2 photos untouched, so the tree line would be visible.  The object had been visible for 35 minutes when I got into my car and left.   I came back home around 7:00 PM, but the object was no longer visible.",

It was large, about one and a half inches in the sky, but it moved slowly, about the same speed as a plane at full altitude.  I stared at it and realized that it was triangular, and it flew, point-forward, across the sky.  It had about 5 lights on it.  Three whites ones situated in a triangular pattern near the front point, and two bright, red lights on each of the other points of the triangle, in this case, which was the back of the craft.

Then 3 days later I got a better view of him when he all brown head to toe faceless appeared in my white living room chair at the window where I had seen him days before. He appeared there only 3 to 5 secounds then vanished. He both times seemed to be noiseless. His appearance was as if he were wearing brown pantyhose body suit, but I had the impression that it was his flesh all the way through. It was a nice bright day both times. I said there were 2 only because they were seen on different days. I am a high school graduate with some art background. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It was about to land I think at Love field as far as I could tell according to the direction it was traveling.  I noticed a light pink and orange object with no sound other than the noise made by the jet and I noticed this slightly glowing craft teardrop in shape or acorn and about the size of a small bus or van  off the jet's right wing about two hundred yards over and about one and hundred fifty yards to the right moving slightly behind  traveling at the same speed the jet was traveling as though it was pacing the jet.

The light began to flash arhythmically then stayed illuminated and moved rapidly and diagnonally from the lower left side of the building to the upper right side of the building, then it flew toward the west (the opposite direction I was travelling), zooming very quickly directly over my vehicle, perhaps 8-10 stories above the ground.  Entire sighting lasted only a few seconds.   My radio was turned off because my daughter was asleep in the car, and I heard no sounds coming from the object and saw no propellers or wings.

      "story": "20:05 hrs., Dallas, TX, wedge shaped object passing approximately 150 feet above house, moving NW to SE at approx 15 mph. At exactly 20:05 hours on the evening of December 5th, 2008, I was in my back yard walking my dogs along with family cats.  Only lights on was backdoor light.  Dogs were running around yard as usual.  What drew my attention to object I witnessed, was one of my cats, who would normally stay distance from me, ran towards me and stopped right by my right leg.  She sat down and was looking up over the roof of house.  I looked at the cat, thinking she was probably just looking at plane lights or maybe a bird so something.  She kept looking, so then I looked up to see what she was seeing. What I believed I saw at first, was a mass of bird flying over, and more than likely geese, since the formation was sort of looked liked a shape of geese migrating.  But then reality hit me.  It was moving at approximately 10 to 20 mph, almost parallel to my street, but when I focused on it, I then could see, that it had mass, and structure of a wedge shape.  It was close enough that I could get a base size from comparing it to the roof of my home.  The overall length was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and height was approximately 7 to 10 feet, and it was only 100 to 200 feet from the ground.  I was looking at the right lower quarter, from bow to stern.  There weren\u2019t any lights or any sound what-so-ever emitting from the craft. The right side was visible because of the lights of homes and a few street lights carried to that height.  I also had a small private aircraft flying at one to two thousand feet at about 2 miles southwest of our location, so I could get some variable and we have high pecan trees which also gave me some comparison to height from the ground. What was apparent, the side wasn\u2019t a smooth surface.  I say this because you could see dark and then somewhat lighter shades.  This to me could have been either two assumptions:  1.  The surface was painted, as we do some of our military aircraft, so it will blend in with the sky (clouds lighter and darker) or 2.  the surface had angles on it which would show lighter for the parts protruding out and dark for the area that was indented. This is similar to our stealth aircraft for displacing radar.  The light of homes and street lights were barely hitting the surface of the object but it was enough to make out the details. I yelled at my wife, who was inside.  When she came out, the object had only moved \u00bc of our block down the street.  I tried to have her follow my arm movement to look down the length of it to be able to see it.  By the time she was in sync with my movement the craft had gained some altitude and was moving away.  The rear of the craft seemed sort of blunt, not the shape appendage you would expect from a tails of an airplane.  It then moved away out of sight, not at an accelerated rate but at a constant speed. My background is journalism.  I\u2019ve spent over 6 years on U.S. Navy aircraft carriers and 6 years on Navy Air Stations, documenting Navy fighters and bombers in flight.  I also was piloting Cessna 150 and 172 aircraft years ago when I started pilot training, so I\u2019m used to aircraft design, determining what you visually see before me in order to navigate and anything associated with flight.  And being a photo journalist I\u2019m very good when it comes to attention to detail.  I wasn\u2019t mentally rattled and didn\u2019t lose my composure but the event left me with allot of questions.   A male friend of my wife at her work, who lives in north Dallas County saw something similar, same design, but with more than one object just a few months ago.",

      "story": "Ok, first of all I want to say that I DO NOT wish to gain popularity, money, fame, etc. from this, all I want is to let everyone know that there are very mysterious things going on and I wish I could know exactly what.  I just feel like I need to tell somebody now because what I saw was incredible.  I have told a few friends but I am most definitely sure that they think I saw something(I don\u2019t care if nobody believes me, I know what I saw).   I love to watch the UFO television shows but I am the type that has to see something in order for me to believe so if my friends came up to me saying they saw something I would also may tell them I believe them but in the back of my mind I would probably think they saw something.  Well let me get started.  It was my friends\u2019 birthday and we decided to go to the club 2009 in Dallas, Texas.  We planned on getting wasted and have a good time like we always do.  Well we got to the club and it was a normal night until I deci! ded to go out to the car and smoke a cig with my girl.  We got to the car around 1:45AM.  We were in the car facing north in the parking lot, I was in the passenger seat and she was in the driver seat.  We were having a conversation over something very old as we watched people walk by.  I remember looking at the security guard on top of the building patrolling, looking down, I guess to make sure nothing crazy happened,  it was around 2:15AM when out of the corner of my eye I saw  UFO floating from east to west as if to be a balloon.  As soon as I saw IT, I said \u201cLook\u201d to my girl and we both rushed out the car to look at the thing, we both are sure it wasn\u2019t a plane or a balloon especially because of its lights.  When we stepped out it seemed to have stopped and it just started getting smaller as it went up and before I could process what the hell was going on, it was gone!  The overall time it was there was around 10 seconds.  Well I must say I was a little drunk but it was! n\u2019t my first time drinking and in all my life of getting drunk! I have never seen things that weren\u2019t there especially disk like flying objects.  I also want to say that WE only saw if for a small amount of time so I don\u2019t want to give a description of it since it may be inaccurate but I do remember that it was circular and it had circular blue lights under it!  I also remember that it was kind of fat in the middle so it wasn\u2019t a perfect circle or sphere, maybe egg shaped but like I said I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail since I may be inaccurate.  All I know is that I saw something that I had never seen before and I really didn\u2019t believe in that stuff but I now know that there is \u201csomething\u201d out there.  The object made no noise and when it started to elevate did not leave a trail/aurora, nothing, it didn't shoot off into space either like on television, it simply elevated very fast.  I am also almost certain that the guy patrolling on the roof saw it but I\u2019m not sure.  I also know it was around 2:15AM because my cousin called at 2:22AM a! nd by then I just kept talking about it and it had just happened. I also want to add that about 2 minutes after we saw the UFO we were standing outside(because I made my girlfriend stand by me just in case we saw something else) I was looking East of in the distance when I saw 2 star like lights moving up and down as if to be playing but when I told her to \"look\" they were gone!  That only lasted for about 3 seconds. If anybody has seen something similar I would love to hear about it and compare, I am really interested and excited because I now know we are not alone.  If you think I was too drunk or I am mistaken, NO! I know what I saw.  I wish I could have captured it on camera but I don't know why I didn't even think about it.  I will go there again and try to capture some proof.",

If it were the way the moved  the speed and the formation they could not have been balloons with flairs. It was such a quick sighting on my part, I just wondered if anyone else got more than I got from my sighting.  I thought it so strange that i was hoping someone else saw it. Thanks for posting.",

Starting at 11:53 as I lay on the porch of my four-story townhouse in downtown Dallas. I was looking up at the night sky and I saw a semicircular object moving from north to south. The shape looked like an incomplete circle of lights that was missing about 1 or 2 lights that would have completed the circle. The single lights that made up the incomplete circle were blue-white and circular, and there were probably about 7 of them. It was moving across the sky at about the same speed that a plane would but it was moving in very sudden, subtle movements and it wasn't exactly moving in a straight line. It also seemed like it would stop on a dime and then continue as it was. Also, when I looked at the formation it looked as if I were squinting my eyes and looking at a streetlight (it was blurry), but as I looked at the stars near the formation, I could see them clearly. They continued on their path for about 2-3 minutes until they disappeared on the other side of my roof. After that I saw another formation moving from west to east. This was probably at 12:30-12:45. It was in a V-shape and it wasn't as blurry as the first one. Again it was moving at about the same speed as an airplane. These could have been jets in a very precise formation heading somewhere but it was completely inaudible. This formation seemed to move in more of a straight line but again they had some sudden, subtle movements that lead me to believe that they were not airplanes. There were probably 7 circular white-orange lights with one in the front and even amount of lights on either side of the \"V\". I am the only observer that I know of. I am 14 years old and I go to a private school in Dallas that requires greater than average intelligence. I wasn't fatigued at all as I saw these formations and I've never had any mental hallucinations or anything before. I have experienced floaters (in eye doctor jargon) but I'm sure that the objects I saw were not them. The wind was going from north to south, so they weren't flares if the! y went f rom east to west. To conclude, I have never really strongly believed in aliens or UFO's or anything of the sort, but this seems very extra terrestrial to me.",

It moved at a very fast speed I would considering the distance it covered in the short time it was illuminated, it covered at least 60-90 degrees of the sky in a matter of 5s and like going behind an invisible wall it vanished. Now I will consider that its relative traveling direction was E-SEish from my apartment complex where in relation to an airport just south of me does have heavy air traffic, however having seen hundreds of planes in the night sky travel over my head this was not the normal.  On the contrary no plane at night turns their lights off especially on approach to land.  Besides every plane makes a noise and this was silent making no noise. Having witnessed multiple \"shooting stars\" I can also say that this was definitely not that either.  It was simply too bright, in my example its as if the lights just went out, like turning a light bulb off w/o the afterglow effect, or nothing like the dwindling light of a \"shooting star\".

      "story": "3 crafts with amber lights suddenly appear , then disappear Time: between 8 and 9 PM, near dusk, partly cloudy with haze. While working at my computer in a bedroom with its window facing south (also faces the front yard of my house), I heard some strange noises outside the window.  The strange noises sounded as if there were hard droplets, hail, or a large amount of pecans falling onto my roof and sidewalk from trees outside.  Being concerned that a thunderstorm was blowing in, I stood up from the computer and went to the window to look through the blinds to see outside. When I peeked through the blinds, the strange sounds immediately stopped.  I looked into the yard and into the street across the way to see if rain drops or hail were falling.  Not seeing any drops of rain or hail, I then looked out onto the horizon to see if there were any thunderstorm clouds, and immediately saw a series of strange lights directly south approximately 15 degrees on the horizon. At first, the lights appeared to be three landing lights on the front of a large airplane heading north. What was strange about this apparent airplane was that it was banked downward as if it were about to turn to the west, but it did not move from this position.  The lights were all of the same amber color, with the two outermost lights the brightest, the center light more dim.  The craft stayed stationary as if it were parked in the sky at an angle.  The other odd thing about this craft was that it seemed to be extremely large, and located approximately 5 or 6 miles southward near the junction of the Dallas North Tollway and I-35.  An estimate of the size was approximately 300 or 400 feet across (huge). Then, incredibly, another craft of similar proportions (but further in the distance), suddenly appeared to the left of the first craft, and it was banked at a different angle compared to the first craft.  The sudden appearance of the second craft was immediate, as if a light switch or strobe had been turned on.  My immediate thought was that there was some sort of fireworks or laser light show being given near the American Airlines Center near downtown.  Then, incredibly, a third craft, immediately appeared to the right, with the same proportions, but at a different distance than the other two craft.  The third craft was also banked at a different angle compared to the others.  It was difficult to discern whether the crafts were actually moving very slowly, or if they were completely stationary. Then, each craft blinked its lights off and on (the three lights of a craft in unison) as if the crafts were communicating with each other.  The blinking seemed to be in a sequence, as if each craft was a separate ornament on a Christmas tree.  The sequential blinking lasted less than 1 or 2 seconds.  All of the lights disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared, but not at the same time (each craft \"turned-off\" at different times). All of the above took place on the order of about 10 seconds.  I have never seen anything like it before. I have been searching the news sites to see if anyone else saw the same lights.

The basic direction was from WSW to ENE - horizontally, and fairly low. This object consisted of a single, bright, white, continuously burning light. Size was indeterminate but it was rather large, much like a small meteor.  The speed would suggest a falling star or meteor and was out of sight as quickly as either, however, neither travel horizontally or as low as this object did.  It was far too fast to be a helicopter or airplane.  I had the windows rolled up and the radio on, preventing me from hearing any sound associated with this object.

The lights appeared go out rather than fade with distance.  The size of the circle of lights was smaller than the moon and I believe that I could have covered the lights with my forefinger had I held out my arm.    We immediately noticed another set of circular red lights moving across the sky above us from south to north almost directly above us at the same rate of speed as the first, and then another.  We went through the house to the front lawn and there appeared to be 15 to 20 sets of circular lights high in the sky, much closer than stars but not moving - they are still there at 10:52 P! M.",

      "story": "Orange Fireball in the sky At approximately 19:30 hrs I was taking out the trash when I looked up into the night sky.  I noticed an orange colored fireball shape making its way across the sky.  Because DFW airport is near, I initially figured it was a landing plane; however, there is no glowing orange landing lights of that I am aware.  I was unable to make out any directional lighting i.e. green and red wing tip lights.  It seemed to be moving faster than that of a plane.   So I watched it for several seconds, it made no change in direction.  The object from my perspective and location moved from a South Eastern direction to a North Westerly direction.   When a commercial plane on approach to DFW came into my view with its landing lights on, I was able to compare the two objects.  I was able to compare the light temperatures which were clearly different.   The size of the orange glow was much larger than that of the planes landing light. Although the orange object appeared closer to my location ! than that of the plane.  I was able to make out the directional green and red lights, in addition, the flashing strobe on top of the commercial plane in the distance.  The orange object did not have any additional lighting.  I also noticed that the orange fireball shape was moving away from my direction and away from the direction of DFW.  In addition, the orange fireball object appeared to be at a higher altitude than the plane. Once it was in the NW quadrant from my location the orange glow went out.   I was waiting to hear the whine of engines or growl of a rocket thrust and heard neither.  My only regret is that I stood watching in awe instead of running for a video camera.",

Shortly before the fireworks began, I noticed to red-orange glowing lights in the distance.  I was about to brush them off as someone in the nearby neighborhood shooting off fireworks, until they continued to move closer to where we were standing.   Mesmerized by them, I continued to stare, but managed to get a couple of quick photos with my cell phone.  They appeared further away than they actually were in the photo.  It would have been easy to dismiss these as Chinese paper lanterns, had they not been SO bright and moving sideways and not at an upward incline at all and it was not windy.  I turned for two seconds to say something to my cousin, and when I looked back to where they were, they were completely gone. The two of us had both completely forgot about this within minutes, until the next day when her brother in-law came to pick up his children and mentioned he saw the same thing, too.  Only he was at least thirty minutes away in Garland. The objects we saw are what I am thoroughly convinced to be UFO's, especially after seeing DOZENS of descriptions from all over the country describing red-orange bright glowing balls moving across the sky the evening of the fourth.",

We parked in a church parking lot at the corner of Gurley Ave and Carroll. Many other people were parked here as well.  As we were waiting for the firework show to start, I noticed two glowing, red/orange, slow-moving orbs, or what I first thought were fireworks.  They resembled Chinese lanterns floating in the sky, IF they had been on fire.  I was thinking, \"Why aren't they racing upward to explode like they usually do?   Why are they so slow?\"  I asked my cousin, \"What ARE those!?\"  Then we noticed they weren't going up, they were moving sideways, and I thought it was weird that they seemed to be \"caught in the wind\" and moving away from where the fireworks would be.  They were moving slowly to the Northwest, at approximately 20-30 mph.  Everyone around us was staring at them, trying to figure out what they were.  They were reminiscent of ta! il lights on a car, but far apart from each other.  Also, they were hovering rather low, which is the other reason I discerned they weren't fireworks.  Low, slow moving, and non-exploding. We watched them for no more than 5 minutes altogether.  I got impatient waiting for the fireworks to start and forgot all about them.  That is, until the next day.  My brother in law arrived at my house to pick up his kids and he sat down and said, \"I SAW something last night.\"  The kids were around so he was hesitant to go into detail at first but I instantly knew what he was talking about.  I told him to tell me what he saw, and he described EXACTLY what my cousin, my son, and I saw, and he lives at LEAST 30 minutes away from where we saw them.  And it was about the exact same time.",

The whole ordeal may have only been about 30 seconds long.  We don't know how long they had been there before we noticed them.

AT THE SAME TIME AS THIS HAPPENING ...THE KIDS POINTED OUT AN ACTUAL PLANE LIKE OBJECT COMING SIDEWAYS CLEARLY DISPERSING CHEMS ALL THE WAY ACROSS.  NOW TO CLARIFY WHAT I WAS SEEING WASNT A EYE TRICK...O! THER ACTUAL AIRPLANES WERE STARTING TO CROSS THE AREAS. WHICH THE KIDS WERE ABLE TO CLEARLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBJECTS.  TO MAKE IT EVEN WEIRDER WE SAW ONE OBJECT THAT CLEARLY HAD NO WINGS BUT MANEUVERED JUST LIKE A PLANE COME ACROSS LAST.  NOW TO GET MORE EVIDENCE I TRIED RECORDING IT WITH MY CAMERA PHONE WHICH RECORDS IN HD 1080P BUT THE OBJECTS DID NOT APPEAR ON CAMERA BUT THE PLANES DID.  THIS ALL HAPPENED BETWEEN 7:15-7:21PM IN NORTH DALLAS.  I WOULD LOVE TO DISCUSS MORE IF U LIKE.",

      "story": "Orange-Red Flying Object Vanishes In Mid-Air Over White Rock Lake Park, Dallas, Texas On February 2, 2012 at approximately 2030 hours over White Rock Lake Park, Dallas, Texas, there appeared in the dark, evening sky an unusual orange-red light, or composite light.  The temperature was 55 degrees.  There were no clouds over this area of Dallas, and the stars were clearly bright and visual in the background.  There was virtually no light pollution over White Rock Lake this evening and the lake was still and dark.  White Rock Lake Park was mostly deserted in this area, however there were several other people walking along edge of the lake.  Apparently they did not notice the object. I was driving with my wife and south on West Lawther Drive on the West side of White Rock Lake.  White Rock Lake is rimmed with large residential estates on the West side of the park, all facing East and overlooking the lake.  West Lawther Drive winds around the perimeter of White Rock Lake Park on the West side. The orange red light was moving from the East to the SouthEast across the 65 degree horizon and in the general flight path approach for Southwest Airlines into Love Field Airport to the West of White Rock Lake.  There were other airplanes in the approach for Love Field Airport in the general vicinity over White Rock Lake.  The orange-red moving light was noticeable and unusual because there were no strobe lights or white lights as are common with commercial or private aircraft.  The orange-red light appeared in the sky at a 65 degree angle from the road and the light source was the approximate size of the commercial aircraft in the area.  The orange-red light was not moving rapidly, or erratically, but rather deliberately on a particular path and at a speed in common with the other aircraft in the vicinity. The orange-red flying object was not a star, planet or meteor. After viewing this object move through the sky and over White Rock Lake for approximately twenty seconds, the object faded and vanished in mid-air over the lake.  Upon closer observation, the orange-red light appeared to have a composite light source of multiple lights. Given that this area of Dallas is restricted airspace and in the approach path for Love Field Airport, it was highly unusual for any flying craft to have no strobe, and to have turned off its lights and or disappeared. The disappearance of the orange-red flying craft was not immediate, and it appeared to have diminished in size before vanishing, leaving one with the impression that the source of the light gained altitude at an unusually rapid speed and not on a trajectory common with traditional airplanes.  This process took less than several seconds. The sky was scanned for several minutes in an effort to locate the object, however this was unsuccessful. I am a graduate of the University of Virginia and Southern Methodist University and have experience piloting private aircraft.  I am familiar with the appearance of aircraft making an approach to Love Field Airport in this vicinity, and of the identifying lights required of aircraft, and can attest that this object was not a commercial, private or conventional military aircraft.  Furthermore, I have observed meteors, comets and other natural celestial phenomena and this object was neither. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you for the reply.  This was a very strange experience.  I intend to contact a few Southwest Airline pilots to ask around if any of their colleagues saw the same on their approach tonight. ((END ADDENDUM))",

      "story": "5 Reddish Amber Lights Moving Multiple Directions Then Disappear. We were all sitting in the back yard when there was a very bright reddish amber colored light that immediately drew our attention just over the tree line.  This even was at about 11:57pm and we watched it just until the ball dropped.  We all went inside to watch the ball drop and celebrate.   We then grabbed the small firecrackers we bought for the kids to see and went out front to the roadway to set them off.  At this point the light was gone.  We were all very confused as to what it was being that it moved in multiple directions then hovered just before we went inside.  After lighting the firecrackers and rounding up the kids to go back inside we saw the light appear much further off in the distance in the complete opposite direction.  Myself and one of the other adults stopped and watched it as it moved east, then north, then hover and disappear again.  About 20 seconds later it reappeared much further away, much too fast for any craft I as a civilian know of.  It then hovered once again for about 20 seconds, flew north west, hovered again for about 10 seconds, then continued northwest.  Slightly after it hovered the last time, another appeared and began to fly towards the original.  As the second sighting got closer to the first, the first completely vanished.  The second hovered and sure enough a third began its ascent towards the second.  The second flew to about where the first vanished and hovered as the third started to move closer.  At this time a fourth came into sight flying towards them both.  The second sighting vanished and a fifth and final appeared and performed a very similar routine until all 5 vanished at roughly the same location in the sky.  We watched for a good 20 minutes afterwards to see if perhaps they would return, they never did.  All 5 sightings were very bright, reddish amber colored, moved in random speeds and direction, made no sound whatsoever, and all vanished at about the same location in the sky. Does anyone else have a good explanation for this?  Why are there so many sightings of these red lights in the sky in the past year?  I have never ever heard about these lights or this site for that matter until tonight's experience.",

      "story": "A single, rectangle shaped object with red lights and alternating blinking white lights, like hazard lights flew over Dallas, Texas. On this night of November 14th, facing a little southeast, at approx. 7:31 pm, while driving with a sibling, we saw an unidentified flying object.  It was rectangle in shape and was black.  It had 5 lights on the front resembling that of high beams, but were blinking like hazard lights but in an alternating fashion.  There were 2 red lights on the outside and 3 white lights in the middle.  The white lights were the main lights blinking, almost like search lights.   The object flew in an upright position so that when it flew over me I could see its underside which was rectangle shaped as well.   The more extraordinary part about this sighting is that I could also hear the object.  It made a light whooshing sound that was softer than that of a plane and kept the same tone.  It was a calming sound like that of ocean waves and I live nowhere near a large body of water capable of producing such a sound.   It also was lower than any plane I've ever seen before.  The object came rig! ht out of the clouds in front of me as I was driving on a residential road near my home.   Seeing the object prompted me to pull over and get out of my car to witness this immaculate event.   The object literally flew right over me allowing to give such specific details.   After this experience was over I got back in my car and pulled off.  As I got on a nearby highway I was able to see the object once again as it faded off into the clouds once more and was at a higher position in the sky than before when it was right over me.   This was one of the most shocking events I've seen.  To actually experience what I've only heard people speculate about and document encounters about is beyond any word I could use to describe.   Truly freaky and bewildering.  I hardly know what to think.",

On our way driving to Dallas on Kings Valley Highway before the S-curves a mile before entering town, my buddy and I noticed a glowing orb 300 ft or so above the tree line.   When I first glanced at it I thought it was a star until I realized it was too big and too low to be one.  My next thought was a radio tower but the light was glowing yellowish gold and not red and there is no radio tower on top of that hill.   As my friend and I drove closer, the light went from 300 feet to to 75 feet or so above the ground in less than a second.  That's when we realized this was no ordinary object.   The light then instantly went to the ground and stopped moving.  The light moved too fast to be a helicopter and was too big to be a firework or flare.  After 4 or five seconds, the light moved to the left of the hilltop then shut off.   My friend and I drove home later that night and the light was no where to be seen.   During daylight you can see everything on that hill top where we spotted the light, and there is no tower or object that emits that color of light or moves that fast.",

      "story": "1200-mph dart silhouette seen for 6-seconds. My first ever UFO sighting occurred from Sylvania Drive, near its intersection with Sinclair Avenue, at about 8:00 pm on December 11, 2013, during a walk.  The night was cold, the sky was clear and there was a day-past first quarter, or fat half-crescent moon.   I saw the object through an opening between some trees across Dixon Branch Greenbelt Park.  The sighting was a brief glimpse of a far-off, dark, silent, dart-shaped silhouette against the clear luminous night sky.  Because the object appeared to be so sharp, I assume that I was looking at an edge-on view of a triangle, but cannot prove this.   Initially, I thought that the shadow was a swept-wing fighter accelerating upward in my direction at a supersonic speed.  It was climbing toward me from the southwest \u2013 note that ALL of my view of this first UFO was along a straight line approaching from the southwest of me.  The craft apparently moved twice the speed of a commercial jet and traveled about two miles in six seconds, both estimates, when put together, gave its speed at about 1,200-mph.   There were commercial jetliners visible to the far north and south, providing a direct comparison.  The silhouette appeared to be generally airplane-sized at 2 to 4-miles distance, but was silent despite the velocity \u2013 a jet interceptor would have been on afterburner and audible at that speed and range. The UFO first caught my attention when it was about 35-degrees elevation and it disappeared at about 50-degrees elevation.  The first quarter or half-crescent moon was at about 60-degrees elevation, also to the southwest.  I roughly estimate that the silhouette first appeared to me about 4-miles away, possibly over the Deep Ellum area, and it disappeared when 2-miles closer, approaching White Rock Lake.  It climbed from 2-miles altitude at Deep Ellum to 3-miles altitude at White Rock Lake.  If the climb and direction were backtracked, its original \u2018takeoff\u2019 may have been the Cockrell Hill areas, which are 8-miles to the southwest.  Although it was getting closer to me, I lost it in the half moon\u2019s glare and could not pick it up on the other side, which would have been almost directly overhead.   The thing seemed phantom-like and eerie, and I was surprised to see it.  The object appeared to be going on a straight course from a lower altitude to a higher destination and I recall chuckling to myself that, \u201cIt must be carrying some cargo.\u201d   I did not think much about this first sighting because it was so distant, vague and impersonal, and did not make a report or discuss it with anyone.  However, I did begin accessing some websites and buying various books about UFOs, for the first time in my 73-years.  In addition, I began scanning the night sky, looking for a repeat performance.

      "story": "Lighted craft hovered for 3-minutes, then dove 1-mile in 5-seconds This is the second of two consecutive reports about my sightings of December 11, 2013 and June 13, 2014, at age 73 and 74, respectively.  I observed my first and only two UFOs ever.   Both of these sightings occurred within a 6-month period from the same general location.  Since these objects appeared to be about the same size and shape, I have the impression that both sightings might have been of the same craft; however, I have no other proof of this assumption.  These are given in chronological order, and the first sighting in 2013 was vague, distant and impersonal \u2013 I did not file a report on it then, nor even mention it to anyone, including my wife.  By contrast, the second encounter in 2014 was a life-changing event \u2013 it was shocking to be shown that we humans are not the only intelligent beings here. My second, very much unexpected and extremely more vivid sighting occurred six months later at 11:00 pm on Friday night, June 13, 2014, near Hexter Elementary School.  I had walked to Gold\u2019s Gym at Northcliff & Buckner at 9:30 pm and had left at 10:50 pm.  It was a beautiful night, comfortably warm, the sky was clear with a full moon and no wind, and there was not the usual city noise.  Nobody else was seen outside and there was no automobile traffic in the neighborhood.  I was walking alone in the middle of the street in the full moonlight. As I was traveling roundabout back to my house, a lighted craft suddenly appeared high over me at Northlake near Peavy.  I was rounding a curve heading generally northward and the lights cleared above the 30-foot trees to my right, or east side.  This occurred within the usual flight path of airplanes originating from south Texas and landing at Love Field; however, at this time most scheduled Southwest Airline flights had finished for the night \u2013 which seemed to be a very important factor in the presence of this thing.   Before 10:00 pm, mostly 737s and some corporate jets fly over here at about 8,000-feet or 1.5-mile altitude, heading north to cross I-635 where they will make a left, west to south U-turn and land at Love Field.  Now, there were not any planes in the sky anywhere.  Subconsciously, I assumed the lights were an airplane, but the object actually stopped directly above me as I was walking alone in the middle of the street.   I instantly looked up and felt that it had be! en watching me on the roadway in the full moonlight \u2013 I was the only rabbit alone on the road.  The craft appeared to be positioned almost 1-mile straight up \u2013 maybe 1 or 2-degrees eastward \u2013 with the apparent size of a large corporate jet; it seemed to be slightly smaller than a 737.  Although it is difficult to estimate size and height at night, I am reasonably sure that it was not over 1-mile, nor under 1/2-mile. (I have since studied airplanes flying directly overhead to confirm this perceived altitude and size.) -See illustration of UFO provided - It had extremely bright lights of pure colors, the brightest I have ever seen and the most beautiful red and green. There was no softness to the lights, only a sharp piercing glare.   The object had a strange jerky aspect unlike any aircraft.  No Federal Aviation Administration navigation lights were apparent \u2013 specifically, green on the starboard, red on the port, flashing strobes on the wingtips, with fore and aft white lights as required below 10,000 feet altitude.  Its lights were arranged in a nonsensical pattern as in my diagram above, with the red lights blinking on and off every 2-seconds \u2013 this appeared to be the front, as the craft moved.  All of the red lights pulsed together; there was no 1-2-3 sequence.  The green lights shined steady, did not blink and appeared to be the sides.   Each red and green row was composed of about 10 individual pinpoint lights, all like bulbs with equal intensity. No other lights, colors or emanations could be seen.  My sketch diagrams the bel! ly of the craft as seen from below.  The body was not visible as a silhouette against the sky because of the bright lights; however, I am certain that there was a rigid structure because the lights maintained their relative position at all times.  If I were to guess, I would say the object was rather triangular because of the arrangement of the lights, but I cannot be sure of this.  It had a clear-cut, garish carnival midway appearance \u2013 there was no vagueness at all.  My initial and vivid impression was as if a Texas State Fairground contraption, such as a Ferris wheel, with its colorful, blinking lights, had been placed 1-mile overhead in the night sky to float around \u2013  it was totally out of place and illogical.  I instantly realized that this was not an airplane, so I quickly stepped under a front yard tree to my right or east side on Northlake, to hide from its view.  My actions were largely reflexive and fear-responsive, so I probably was only visible to the craft for a few! seconds. Immediately after I hid, the object seemed to have lost me, because it began to go back and forth, do figure-8s, hover and rock as I watched from between the leaves. Imagine that you are standing on the bottom of a lake watching the bottom of a big motorboat circling above you on the surface; similarly, seen by me from below, the circling craft acted as though it was floating on a flat horizontal surface.  The effect was like looking up at the bottom of a large launch that was being driven around on a choppy lake surface; perhaps the medium or force upon which the craft rode \u2013 or it created \u2013 was wavy.  The craft stayed contained within an imaginary circle of about 1/4-mile diameter eastward of me as it apparently searched; it never strayed to the west side of me.  Of course, its actions were faster than a motorboat as it maneuvered around searching the bottom below.  When it stopped, it seemed to rock like a boat, as though floating on waves.  The craft appeared to be driven or controlled by a coxswain who was methodically searching the bottom below, making its movements selective, erratic and chaotic as it went back and forth, repeatedly, stopping and going. The object emitted a very faint but perceptible whirring sound from high up, similar to an electric motor brush.  This sound had that same distant overhead audio quality as some hot air balloons, ultra-lights and blimps that I have heard from the ground while they were high above me; I have heard voices, burners and motors from these.  With this UFO, I had both eyed and eared confirmation of an actual materially structured mechanical craft and of its apparent vertical distance above.  Furthermore, the tone or pitch of the electrical motor sound seemed to change throughout its movements overhead, as though accommodating various mechanical requirements. Throughout all of this, I was busily playing devil\u2019s advocate \u2013 \u201cCould this be an electrically powered human-fabricated aircraft?\u201d  Suddenly, I realized that if whatever was controlling this thing had infrared vision that I had better get behind the wooden tree limbs, which I promptly did.  For whatever reason, the object appeared to be searching for ground-based subject matter, so I remained cowing against the tree trunk and became a certified tree-hugger.  To add to my problems, the front yard\u2019s motion detector light turned on. This weirdness went on for the longest three minutes, my anxiety level was rising and I began to wonder how it would all play out.  Suddenly, without any warning, the object instantly streaked nose-first at a downward angle, around 45-degrees, east-northeast toward the Lochwood Park area. It went from hovering almost directly overhead, down to the horizon, traveling over a 1-mile distance, at one constant and terrific speed. There was no observable acceleration against inertia or deceleration against momentum. I have watched high-performance jets stall out several miles above and then rev up to flight speed \u2013 this takes several seconds. My UFO did this instantly! When its lights disappeared through the trees and just above the horizon, it was still travelling at the same speed without slowing down. Its observed lack of inertia and momentum implied that the object had no mass, as though it were only a mirage or light image, and it actually looked somewhat that way during the d! ive. Although I could only see the lights, the craft appeared to be intermittent between a real object such as a bus or airplane, and an artificial movie-projected image of such. That is, at times, it would have passed for a solid material night-flying helicopter; while at other times, the lights seemed transparent and unreal, like projections on a movie screen. The greatest division in this dichotomy appeared between the very separate hovering and diving phases. During the overhead circling, I felt as though I could rap my knuckles on the craft; conversely, during the dive, I felt as though my arm might go through it. This division was reinforced by the whirring mechanical sound of the craft as it hovered, contrasted by the total silence when it dived at supersonic speed. Lending to this impression, a solid form would have created friction, pushed the air aside and made a horrific noise; this thing made no sound whatsoever. There was no noise at all during the dive \u2013 any air-dis! placement whoosh, sonic boom, crash or explosion \u2013 anything! Artillery shells make a distinctive sound as they pass through the air, and this speeding UFO should have done likewise. Incredibly, there appeared to be no resistance from the air. I felt that if I had shot this thing with a rifle, the bullet would have gone through it. Because of the lack of both inertia and air resistance, I must assume that there was no solid object \u2013 AS WE KNOW IT \u2013 during the dive phase. This raises my question of whether the UFO was somehow outside of our physical reality, a consideration that might apply to the origin of these things. I assume that a craft from another solar planet or star system would obey the same Newtonian physical laws that we do \u2013 but this thing did not do this. - See diagram of flight path provided - Visualize a right triangle with me on the ground at the 90-degree angle, and the craft 1-mile above me, searching within a 1/4-mile diameter circle to the east.  The full Moon is southeast, at about 50-degrees elevation at 11:00-pm CDT, at its lowest zenith in June \u2013 exactly opposite the Sun. The UFO dove toward the east-northeast at about a 45-degree angle. I have fine-tuned the compass direction with several visits; however, because it dived away from me, the exact descent angle cannot be exact.  Therefore, I have bracketed or averaged it as 45-degrees, and the \u2018landing point\u2019 would be approximately 1-mile away horizontally at the other 45-degree angle.  On the map, that would be around the Lochwood Park area.  Draw a line from Northlake-Peavy east-northeast across Lochwood Park and somewhere along this track is where the UFO \u2018landed.\u2019  By geometry, the flight path or hypotenuse would be about 1 1/4-mile long \u2013 or a little over 1-mile when discounting the 10-degree roofline.  The object\u2019s closest proximity to me would be about 7/10-mile as it slid down the hypotenuse.  I watched its lights through the trees until the craft was about to slam into the ground about 1/10-mile above the actual horizon.  Seeing the UFO dive to the horizon greatly helped me to scale and confirm my original vertical estimate as about 1-mile altitude, and no lower than 1/2-mile. I have used three methods to determine and confirm the exit speed as about Mach-1.  First, my daughter and I have attended the Fort Worth Alliance air show annually for over twenty years \u2013 a father-daughter thing.  There are always jet interceptor fly-bys, usually by an F-18 Super Hornet, at Mach-1, whereby the sound shock wave is visible forming off the fuselage.  The June 13 UFO simply appeared to be diving that fast and that is what I settled on. Second, it took no more than 5-seconds for the craft to go from 1-mile overhead, then 45-degrees downward to the horizon, a dive distance of over 1-mile.  Here, I estimated the dive time, based upon my gut feel of 5-seconds.  Third, at home I pointed my finger at an imaginary UFO and had my daughter time my downward sweep with a watch, always getting about 5-seconds.  In summary, 1-mile multiplied times 5-seconds works out to 720-mph, or about Mach-1. At the short end of the spectrum, time is easy to estimate. Two, five and ten-seconds can be accurately guessed.  As time gets longer, estimating becomes more inaccurate \u2013 one minute is more difficult and an hour is even more so.  Five-seconds were easy to guess and to confirm by dragging my hand downward and having someone else clocks me.  My object had lights that pulsed every two seconds and it dove within about five seconds \u2013 these times were simple to bracket and measure.  I estimated that the craft hovered above me for 3-minutes because it seemed like 3-minutes, even when considering the lengthened anxiety factor.  In addition, I bracketed the hovering phase \u2013 it was certainly longer than 1-minute and probably shorter than 5-minutes \u2013 thus, 3-minutes.  My calculations of distance, time and speed all conform to one another mathematically \u2013 its red lights blinked every two seconds, the object hovered about 1-mile above for 3-minutes and exited at a 45-degree downward angle, di! ving within about 5-seconds at a speed of around 720-mph. As the craft streaked downward toward the horizon, its lights were visible through the nearby trees, but of course, the lights were blocked when they went behind the roofline.  The angle of total disappearance was about 5 or 10-degrees above the actual horizon, which would have been about 1/10-mile above the ground at the \u2018point of impact.\u2019  Seeing the object go through the far tree line greatly reinforced my vertical estimate as 1-mile distance.  The UFO\u2019s path of descent formed an imaginary \u2018hypotenuse of a right triangle,\u2019 which is depicted in the third diagram.  At the horizontal, its size and distance could be compared to foreground features \u2013 much as a rising full moon can be compared to nearby hills, trees, houses and so forth \u2013 this confirmed my estimation of the overall scale of the UFO flight path. The contrast between the 3-minute hovering and the 5-second dive was astounding, and suggested that there were two methods of control during these two phases \u2013 manual and autopilot.  This dichotomy erased all doubt as to whether or not this was a human construction.  The circling and wobbling object appeared to be silly, jerky, and almost Warner Brothers cartoonish with the super bright garish lights \u2013 the reds pulsing on and off, and the greens glowing steadily.  The searching was asymmetrical, irregular and chaotic \u2013 as though a coxswain was steering the boat randomly and impulsively as he searched the ground far below.  If I had witnessed only the hovering phase, I would not be convinced that it was not some type of human-made aircraft. By contrast, had I seen only the 5-second dive, I would not be convinced that it was not some reentering satellite debris.  This exit plunge was straight, steady, mechanical, meteor-like and almost blurred.  Unlike in its erratic circling phase, the fast diving craft did not appear to be arbitrarily piloted, but went down uniformly at a constant speed in a straight line from A to B as though programmed and automatic.  It appeared as if a switch was flipped, which said, \u201cTake me from here to there.\u201d  Certainly, no human pilot would have had nerve reflexes fast enough to control this suicide dash downward and I assume the same for any biological organism.  As it dove, the form or basic structure of the object was perfectly retained \u2013 the blinking red bar of lights in front and the two steady green rows of lights on the sides. However, more so than when it was circling, the craft looked strangely like an artificial light image as it dashed downward, with the pulsing red lights at th! e front. Possibly, the angle of the lights were turned away from me somewhat, making them appear dimmer, thus contributing to the dichotomy of appearance. The object went down angled into the dive and all of its light structure was retained intact, as though it being a rigid object. However, both of these phases, when put together said that this was not grandma\u2019s biscuits. I looked straight at this thing for 3-minutes as it hovered, and for 5-seconds as it dove \u2013 it definitely was NOT a human-made aircraft! A saying goes that we should always look for ponies before we look for unicorns. In the best tradition of looking for ponies, immediately following the sighting I attempted to eliminate all plausible possibilities. I considered a DRONE as an explanation, and several other folks, including my wife, have since offered the drone scenario (which seems to be the contemporary Debunker explanation for all UFOs today). This would certainly fit the hovering and whirring electric motor sound, since several drone models are electric powered hovering devices. Immediately after this event, I asked myself, \u201cDid someone launch and retrieve a drone from the Lochwood Mall parking lot?\u201d However, I quickly dismissed my devil\u2019s advocacy here because this explanation would have been more unrealistic than a \u2018flying saucer.\u2019 The large size, mile altitude, glaring lights and exit speed ruled against a drone. Hobbyist\u2019s electric RC craft are small, weak and slow, and they fly at very low altitudes. ! Military drones are larger and more powerful, but still rather slow. These are secretive, conserve power to remain on patrol for long periods, and they do not waste batteries on bright lighting; the CIA is not going to advertise its presence with glaring, blinking lights. All of this goes against the large corporate jet-size of my UFO, which was hovering 1-mile up with lights blazing while milling back and forth. Consider the Mach-1 exit speed. No drone, civilian or military, is streamlined or powerful; indeed, such a design would be antithetical to the hovering purpose of a drone. All drones have propellers or rotors. No propeller driven airplane has ever achieved Mach speed and survived \u2013 ever!  This formidable velocity requires an aerodynamic, reinforced coke bottle-shaped fuselage, sweptback razor thin wings, and a turbojet engine with a powerful afterburner.  Even the fabled F-86 Saber Jet and MiG 15 of Korean War vintage could not reach the speed of sound.  Moreover, no human-constructed aircraft \u2013 prop or jet \u2013 would have pulled out of such a steep dive at that speed. Finally, yet importantly, all aircraft, civilian and military, CIA or FBI, drone or whatever, flying high in United States commercial airspace are required by law to conform to FAA lighting standards.  This is to prevent mid-air collisions with other planes.  As ruled by the National Transportation Safety Board, an \u2018aircraft\u2019 is any device used for flight in the air \u2013 there are no exceptions!  My observed object was violating a main landing flight path over northeast Dallas, which would have been filled with vulnerable commercial Love Field traffic an hour earlier.  It was shining and blinking bright garish lights that were arranged in the bizarre pattern illustrated above, that made no sense and which conformed to no codes or regulations.  If it were any human-made object, it would have been flying illegally and in violation of United States law. My UFO had a definite symmetrical structure, differential lighting, a variable mechanical sound, a 3-minute time of operation and a complex behavior, so it was not a natural phenomenon such as a mirage, ball lightning, plasma, Venus, meteor, swamp gas and so forth. It moved back and forth against the wind, so it was not a passive lighter-than-air object such as a balloon, kite or Chinese lantern. During its high-speed dive, the UFO exhibited no inertia or momentum, and it made no sound; therefore, it was not a human-made aircraft \u2013 no human construct can do this. All of this taken together leaves only a NOT human solution. Of interest, the June 13 object appeared to be predatory by its raptor-like tactics. First, there was the sneaking up and hovering above me. Second, after I hid under a tree whereby it lost me, the craft started to circle as though scanning the ground for a replacement. Third, it seemed to have spotted another ground-based subject, toward which it made a dive. (Of course, we want to believe this target was an abductee \u2013 whether true or not.) The entire affair was reminiscent of a hawk circling in the sky and stooping at a mouse in a field. I suspect, but will never know, that my quick reflexive hiding may have saved me from being confronted by whatever was operating this thing. It was never closer than 7/10-mile during the 5-second diving. Other than the expected natural anxiety and elevated adrenaline, I have never experienced any unusual symptoms then or afterwards. I actually arrived home earlier than planned because I did not proceed with my exercise walkabout, thus had ! no \u2018missing time.\u2019 Several months later, I have not experienced any side effects, so I guess that I am in the clear\u2026 The weirdly blinking red and the stationary green lights made no sense; were they designed for them or for us? I have reviewed many other UFO reports and have never seen any pattern described like mine; therefore, I assume it was either a custom job or the object could configure its own lighting scheme.  All that I can surmise is that the garish, colorful lights might have been an enticement or gimmick to instill interest and attract a sucker to stand still and gawk. I know that I certainly was enticed to observe this thing; only my fear of the unknown overrode my curiosity and kept me from standing in the open street and observing it.  This entire affair became a delicate balance between me hiding from the craft and me peeking at it. Of note, the UFO did not execute whatever action it desired, against whatever ground-based target it apparently had \u2013 from high up during its hovering position.  There were no visible projectiles, rays or whatever extending downward from the object toward any ground subject; conversely, there was nothing from the ground, which came upward to the craft.  Apparently, the object had to dive physically from its mile-high perch down to whatever it had targeted at ground level.  It appeared to have needed to get near whatever its interest was to accomplish whatever it wanted to do.  This would be like a hawk needing to get down grasping a mouse with its talons.  I estimate that the UFO \u2018landed\u2019 somewhere along a straight path, east-northeast from Northlake-Peavy, with Lochwood Park as the central impact.  It was traveling at a constant Mach-1 velocity as it approached about 1/10-mile above the ground.  I did not see it again as I walked home after that, so the object either stopped instantly or else it drilled into the ground.  Afterwards, there was no explosion, no news report and no evidence of damage. Two days after my June 13 observation, I wrote a short letter to the Dallas Morning News in hopes that other witnesses, perhaps near Lochwood Park, had seen where the object went and what it did after plunging below the tree line.  My letter was not published, which suggests that when these things are reported to the mainstream news media, they are laughed off.   Circuitously, since no one hears about them, there is nothing to them!  During my lifetime of 74-years, I have never seen anything that I could not explain; I can even explain my two Unidentified Flying Objects and thus make them Identified Flying Objects \u2013 they simply are highly advanced machines, designed, built and operated in our atmosphere by intelligent creatures that are NOT human.  What these beings are or where they are from, I can only speculate; however, their existence and activity in our environment is a 100-percent fact, from my direct observations.  This reality should help support those claims by other witnesses of fantastic and bizarre UFO occupant activity, as being a very real physical possibility. All of the testimony given here is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of two high-quality reports which have been submitted by the same witness.

I went through the Lake Highlands Baptist Church parking lot, at the intersection of Northcliff Drive and Parkhurst Drive. This Church is about 1-mile northeast of White Rock Lake in northeast Dallas, Texas. Directly to my southwest, about 20-degrees above the horizon, were about twelve orange lights, forming about six distinct pairs. The lights were each uniformly as bright as a full Venus, but were pure orange in color. No FAA aircraft navigation colors were visible, specifically white, red and green. The lights appeared to be over the Fair Park area, at about 5,000-feet in altitude and 5-miles distance. The span inside each pair was comparable to a 737, from wingtip to wingtip. Each two lights appeared to be mated, but I could not see any solid object between the lights. None of the pairs seemed attached with a different pair, as they slowly moved around independently. Each pair was separate of the other pairs and they appeared to be at various staggered distances. I only saw a flat-on view of these things from their northeast side, and do not know the other side. Another witness 71975 saw the lights from another angle and could give triangulation. A jetliner was directly behind the lights to the southwest at about 10,000-feet altitude and 10-miles away. This aircraft apparently left D-FW Airport and was traveling in a southeast direction behind the lights. The night was clear and the lights were steady for 5-minutes, so they were not natural phenomena. They were much too large, bright, high and stable to be Chinese lanterns. These were illegally hovering near a Love Field flight path, five miles south of the runway, for five minutes without proper navigation colors; therefore, they were not man-made objects. These orange lights should have been easily seen by Love Field aircraft and traffic control and recorded. The pairs each slowly faded out one by one after about five minutes.",

I was outside in my back yard at 10:15 pm CST, on Saturday March 5, 2016.  To my southeast I saw a moving bright red light that was flying level at about 3,000-ft altitude and at about 1-mile horizontal distance from me.  It was flying northeast, from my right to my left, along a path roughly estimated to follow Garland Road from Casa Linda Plaza to Whiterock Marketplace Shopping Center, where it then turned northward toward Lochwood Park (Google Map). At first, I thought it was a small airplane in straight level flight without much variation. Its speed was about 200-mph, too fast to be a helicopter.  I looked for any other lights, specifically white strobes and green navigation lights, but it only had a steady intense red.  Since it is illegal to fly below 10,000-feet without white lights, I quickly inferred that it was not an airplane or other human construct.  No craft silhouette was visible because of the steady bright red light.  Then, I purposely listened intently for an airplane sound, but there was only dead silence.

To my southeast from behind the neighborhood housing, a moving single bright red light suddenly appeared at about 30-degrees elevation.

It was cloudy and the object was flying low and under the clouds.   It was a sphere with red, blue and orange lights emitting from it.  It was flying too slow to be a meteor and low enough that I could see it was a sphere.   It was flying North West from the South East and as it passed over our house the lights turned off.  But with the clouds in the sky, I could still see a dark sphere against the white cloud backdrop.  And it kept moving until it disappeared.",

      "story": "Large UFO with four red lights appears to do something inexplicable to the power grid in Dallas. I have wanted to report this sighting for a long time, but could not confirm the exact date until recently.  There were multiple witnesses (some very close) and physical effects (power grid disturbance). My girlfriend asked me to follow her to pick up the kids.  She didn't say why.  They were at a friend's 13th birthday party on New Year's Eve.  At a high point near White Rock Lake where the downtown skyline could be seen she pulled up beside my car, rolled down her window, pointed to downtown and asked, \u201cWHAT IS THAT?\u201d  Above the neon green-lit 72-story Bank of America Plaza building, a huge object, chevron or disk-shaped with four very large red lights visible around the base which were pulsating in a strangely synchronized but unpredictable way, appeared to be almost parked on the roof.  Maybe 100 feet above it.  It was larger than the top of that skyscraper.I said \u201cI have no idea\u201d. I wanted to stay and observe but she said, \u201cCome on we've got to get the kids now!\u201d and took off.  I followed, glancing at the object any chance I got visibility on the way. When we arrived the object was gone but the kids ran full speed to me saying\u201c (name deleted)  WE SAW A UFO!  WE SAW A UFO!\u201d.  They were so excited that they were tugging on my clothes.  I asked, \u201cWhere was it?\u201d They said, \u201cRIGHT THERE!\u201d, pointing above a large live oak in the front yard. I asked them how big it was and they said \u201cBIG!\u201d.  I asked what shape it was, but they couldn't say for sure because it was so close that it was partially obscured by the huge live oak tree.  They said it had red lights around the bottom. It turned out that the reason we were picking them up early was because they were terrified by this object.  When I went in to talk to the homeowner he said that he also saw it briefly.  He said \u201cFollow me I want to show you something\u201d.  He pointed in both directions up and down the street and said \u201cLook at the lights.\u201d  All the street lamps and porch lights were a very dim, faint yellow in both directions as far as I could see.  I had never before seen anything quite like this.  It looked like all the light bulbs had been replaced by tiny yellow candles inside.  It was as though 95% of all available power had been sucked out of the grid, leaving only a tiny trickle.  Clear cloud-free night.  I hadn't noticed this in all the excitement when we first pulled up. He said, \u201cLet me show you something else\u201d.  I followed him back inside and he tried to turn on his TV, but the power was so weak that it wouldn't come on.  Same thing with the stereo, although the inside lights and lamps were lit, seemingly by tiny candles. I asked \u201cHow long has it been like this?\u201d  He said, \u201cEver since the kids ran in screaming about the UFO\u201d. That's about it.  The next day (New Year's Day), my friend said that the power returned to normal perhaps an hour or two after we left. I found a match for this object when I ran across this video from Turkey:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSNViG1HoX8. At the very end you can see an object racing off over the water near dawn and it has the exact same four red lights! Same object with no doubt. Starting at 3:13 into the 3:58 video.",
