Friday, July 19, 2019 - At 9:50 PM EST, I was in the swimming pool at Post Ballantyne, when I saw a bright object, like a star (but three times bigger) or a satellite (four times bigger), flying north at about 15,000/20,000 feet.  I am always fascinated and very interested in flying objects, and I know that this was not a star, not a shooting star, not an airplane, not a drone and not a helicopter.  There was no engine sound.   A minute later a saw a second one, and then a third one, and a fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh.  Two minutes later I saw ten more, and ten more and then ten more.  Three minutes later I saw twenty more, and twenty more, and twenty more.  They were not flying in formation, rather randomly.  There were three other people with me in the pool, a man, a woman, and a child.  I asked them if they could see what I was seeing and they were totally surprised to see the flying objects.   We tried to take photographs with our phones, but they were too smal! l for the cameras.  The objects were flying in direction south to north, slightly west (5 degrees) from where we were.  They kept coming for the next 20 minutes.  Between 10:00 and 10:10 PM was the largest number of objects flying at one time.  Always flying at the same altitude, same direction, and same speed.  Then they started to decrees (contrary as they had started) until I saw the last one at about 10:20 PM.   I am a pilot and a keen observer of the sky, and I do not believe in UFOS, BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING very fascinating that I had never seen before.  Quite intriguing and fascinating. I need to investigate this event more and try to find a logical explanation, but if I do not find an explanation I feel I might become a believer in UFOS.",

      "story": "Whooshing sound with 1-red and 3-white lights that went silent. At approximately 3:30 a.m. EST while on work break in South Charlotte I heard a strange whooshing sound for about 5 minutes, I looked up and did not initially see anything.  The sound continued, but did not get louder nor distant, then I saw a single red blinking light followed by 3 very bright and vibrant white lights (brighter than those that come from Xenon gas bulbs) that flashed one at a time making a line pattern in a different direction than the red light, making it appear as if the object was changing course,  however,  when the red light would re-appear, it was at the front of the direction the object was moving, and the white lights were angled off to the side. .  If all those lights were to be illuminated at once, it would have made an \u201cL\u201d shape.  I see all types of commercial and military air craft here at night especially being in the flight pattern of the airport, I have also seen weather balloons, satellites (no blinking to their lights) and the international space station fly over.  None of which had the sound or light patterns I experienced tonight.  The strangest part of this experience was that when my eyes focused on those lights as it was directly above my head, the sound ceased.  Even as the object passed, and what you would usually hear from the rear of a craft as it passes by, there was complete silence as I watched it move overhead then eventually out of sight.  I have to add, I am a total skeptic and I have tried for hours to make logic of this experience, but the more I try, the more questions I have.  Most importantly, if it were a military type jet propulsion aircraft the sound is more like a constant distant thunder (even when it is very high in the sky) that gets louder as it gets closer, then the sound gradually fades.  This was not at all like anything I have ever heard\u2026the sound was more like the noise an MRI machine makes at top speed.

      "story": "This disk with various colors of light 'oozing' around the bottom section was seen just above the trees at the corner Dotger Avenue and 7th Street (above 2420 E. 7th Street) sometime around 1975. I was only a child when my mother call me from the kitchen with a certain urgency in her voice that was never heard before or ever again after the event.  I suppose I was only six or seven (1974 or 1975) when her eerie cry had me running from the living room where the TV had been keeping me company.  I joined her at the window and witnessed something less than 60 meters away. \u201cDo you see it?\u201d she asked. I did see it.  I saw it.  Beautiful!  How flawless in form, size, and color for a vehicle.  A big, rounded flying\u2026 car?  The bottom section of the disk had a bright blue glow that was being replaced by a new color from left to right as it seemed to ooze into view.  A new color followed it around (always counter-clockwise) very slowly as I heard my mother ask a new question. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cI think it is a\u2026\u201d  Then I thought, \u2018My mother is asking me what it is?  You mean she doesn\u2019t know?  Was she testing me?  The color red began to ooze in behind the last color and then just as slowly came another.  Mesmerized, my mother and I watched this thing hover just above the trees and give us the lava lamp show of our lives.  Before long we were saying the colors in unison as they came into view and waited a few seconds for the next color to appear.  I remember wanting to be the first to guess the next color or say what it was as soon as I could see any hint at what the color would be as it slowly made it\u2019s appearance. \u201cBlu-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-u-e\u2026 gre-e-e-e-e-e-e-n\u2026\u201d \u201cHey Mom, can we go outside?\" After several minutes my panic-stricken mother moved me to the dining room where I watched it from a bay window and she made phone calls to police, the airport, my dad, and then gave up from frustration at being laughed at or hung up on.  I watched the flying saucer and for so long that I actually got bored of it and went back to the TV set only to return to the window during commercial breaks.  Alas, it was out of view.  What could have been the most remarkable encounter of the first kind, was over and done without even a single photo.  The heavily used camera was out of film.  I had one of the most extraordinary experiences ever and it never really sunk in until the day I told someone what I saw and they laughed at me.  I would give everything I own if intelligent extra-terrestrial life was be COMMON KNOWLEDGE.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

August 21, 2007, approximately 8:45 p.m.  Noticed a blinking disk-shaped object in the northeastern sky above downtown Charlotte that appeared from nowhere, moved around a small area of the sky, blinking and disappearing, then appearing again, hovered for several minutes.  I went inside to get my boyfriend as a witness and a pair of binoculars, and when we got back outside, the craft had disappeared from its location.  After watching for several minutes, another disk-shaped object appeared in the north-northwestern sky above the incoming flight pattern to Charlotte-Douglas International Airport for a few seconds, and disappeared.  Another craft then appeared directly afterward, hovering still, slightly more westerly and lower in the sky.  This craft hovered for approximately 5 minutes before disappearing below the tree line.  We were both stunned that the object was in full view and seemed to be right in the landing path of incoming flights; several planes came in over the craft while it was present.  These three (or maybe it was just one on the move?) had red and white blinking lights.  Boyfriend looked directly up from our vantage point and pointed out what he described as a bar-of-soap shaped object with a satellite that looked like a glowing white orb.  I did not witness this particular object.  I am located just south of center-city with a direct view of the Charlotte city skyline and often sit on my deck at night.  I have witnessed these things for months (and often grab the binoculars and my boyfriend to witness - if nothing more than for confirmation that I\u2019m not seeing things), most of the time over the airport or in the northeastern sky.  The objects have appeared nightly for months until about the second week of July, and were gone completely until this week when they reappeared.  They are most often saucer or disk shaped with blinking lights or steadily but dimly glowing orbs.",

      "story": "Grayish object flying fast North to south over Independence Blvd On September 02, 2007, at 2339, I was looking up during a cigarette break at work, standing at the Carmax on Independence Blvd in Charlotte, NC.  There is a low to medium level of light pollution, and looking almost straight up under an overhang cuts out most of that.  I was outside about 5 minutes, and I was looking up, as I usually do at night, looking at constellations, and I happened to notice and watch a very high flying airliner flying approximately east to west.  I then noticed an object flying very fast approximately north to south.  It was a dark grayish shape, with a tiny spot of an orangish color that really seemed like a reflection of light versus an active light, and it was almost unnoticeable except for the movement.  I would say it was almost oval-ish.  It first appeared directly overhead, and was flying at a much higher rate of speed than I've seen any aircraft at a visible level.  It was going slow enough to follow it with the naked eye, however.  I first thought it might be a helium ballon due to the characteristics of appearing smaller but moving faster than a plane may.  However, there is no wind during this incident. I have no idea how high or the size of the object, but I would guess possibly 2000 feet up, possibly more, but no where near the height of the airliner.  It traveled in a straight line, jinked to the right similar to a bat would move, about 6-10 degrees, flew about a second on that heading, then jinked back to the left, again in the same instantaneous motion, a smooth, quick motion, while continuing on.  I would say from noticing it almost directly overhead, until I could not see it, lasted about 5-7 seconds.  I shouted at a coworker to look up, but they had just stepped out of hearing range at the time.  I am not taking any medication, do not drink, and have been at work about 6 hours when this happed, so I am fully awake and alert.  I called Charlotte Douglas airport and asked for a controller to ask if they saw anything, they replied the only thing they had was a plane flying around to land at the airport. I know there is no way this thing was a plane.  No flying lights, no blinking lights, the 2 smooth curves it made while flying.  If there was a helicopter that could angle that fast, I might believe that is what I saw, however there were no lights and I don't believe helicopters fly nearly that fast. I spent 10 years in the Air Force and have seen a few planes fly.  Nothing this fast, seemingly lower height, and the turns/curves it made.  Would like to hear if anyone else saw anything.",

      "story": "We were under brilliant illumination that was much brighter than the 2:30 pm afternoon clear day sunlight. I noticed intense but unusual ground effects lighting all around us before I noticed what was causing it.  There were no clouds, it was a bright, sunny, blue sky, October afternoon with the sun shining to our right, casting long shadows in the sand. I had sat down on a swing for about 5 minutes, watching my son playing in the sand to my left, when all of a sudden I physically felt an extremely intense, powerful double shock wave that initially seemed strong enough to stop my heart momentarily from beating. When I looked around me, everything was lit up brilliantly in a strange light grey light, and then looked over at my son 7 feet away from me, I could clearly and obviously see that we were being intensely illuminated from directly above. When I looked over at my son, his own shadow below his body was razor sharp around him on the sand, but when I looked straight up in the sky, the two round objects were actually about 3-4 miles over to our right instead, which was confusing because the light they were emitting made it seem as if they were only 100 feet straight above us.  His bright red jacket appeared only grey, there was no color vision at the time of the sighting.  The light seemed brilliant grey, and actually eradicated all of the shadows eminating from the bright sunlight.  They were heading south to north, same speed, same line of movement, second one behind the first one about a mile or two behind, and were the same size each, circular in shape with about 7 concentric non-contacting rows of brilliant but separate and staggered, huge, stationary sparks underneath them, but coming out of the underside of the objects. The sparks were static and appeared photographic due to total non-movement, but with random, smaller bright shards of blue and red in each of the white and also each of the yellow sparks. The first, outer, ring of sparks was white, the second two smaller inner, concentric rings were yellowish in color, the next smaller ring was white and the next two were yellowish ag! ain in c olor, with the final, smallest ring being white sparks. But in the exact center of each object was a huge black circular discharge of downward facing uneven energy, like an enormous jet black spark, as was all of the other sparks, each facing downwards as well.  I could tell the black energy was larger because it was blocking out the few rows of sparks that were behind it.  The second, trailing object then zoomed quite rapidly up to the first one, as they each continued northbound, and then immediately bounced off of without ever hitting it in two or three tiny little loops to the right of it, then instantly approached it again, and once more seemed to be deflected somehow by the first one in 4-5 little swirling looping motions on the left side of the first object.   The first object remained perfectly stationary at both times.  Then the second object went all the way back to its original distance and position and once again approached the first object again, same speed, but this time, apparently making a smoother approach, because it went slowly under the first one, because the first one started disappearing as in a crescent shape above it, and then the top one dissappeared completely, apparently as it overlapped the second one now below it.  Due to their similar size, they now appeared as one object.  Then, after traveling another few miles towards the north, above to my left, they rapidly and suddenly flung apart from each other, the top one seemed to deflect to the right where I could still see the rings of sparks on the bottom of it and then the second one deflected to the left of it flipping almost on its side at an angle towards my direction because I could see the top of it, that it was covered in a greyish brownish material, soft looking, and it had no windows or doors and had a smooth dome shape directly in the middle of its center. When they both instantly flung apart from each other, they also instantly and abruptly stopped at the same exact time completely in mid-air.  At that instant, that ! they bot h stopped in mid-air for perhaps two seconds that I could tell, then they both, at the same precise instant, disappeared from view completely without any indication of speed, flight trails or even any apparent flight direction whatsoever.   I used to work in the financial accounting field, so paying attention to details was very important.  I also did not feel threatened or afraid at any time of the sightings even because of the strange light because they made no movements towards us, they simply seemed to be maneuvering in the sky, and the way they moved so effortlessly, made it seem to me as if they were floating on top of a solid surface, even though they were so high up in the sky.

It was stationary so we thought it WAS a  police helicopter. Then it dawned on us that our police dept most likely doesn\u2019t  own that many helicopters! They had flashing lights but were not flashing lights on the ground like police helicopters do when they are looking for someone etc. They just hovered ther and were very bright. As we merged onto I85 we saw 2 then 3, then 4 more similar objects/lights in the distance all what appeared to be exactly the same distance away from one another. We live in the city, at the end of a street  near a hospital ,with helicopters landing and taking off many times of the day and night, so we know what they look and sound like day and night.  We are also very familiar with the airports traffic patterns and what several airplanes coming in towards the airport on the horizon look like.  This was not like that. These objects hovered like helicopters had flashing lights of red gold and white all at the same altitude over the distance of about 10 miles altogether. As we drove down the road, (about 8-10 miles or so, we saw all of the lights remain where they were, but began to notice in between them were VERY small objects (tiny red lights) that travelled at very high speeds  between the brighter larger main objects. We stopped the car and witnessed several of these small objects travelling very fast in different directions.   Our son became worried because we were shocked and very interested to the point that we stopped the car, so we continued on to the grocery store and went inside.",

One night, about 1 a.m.,  I was returning home from studying late at the library.  I was suddenly forced off the road by a blowout.  I stopped the car and began to change the tire when suddenly my car radio started changing channels rapidly and the car lights began to flicker and dim.  All of a sudden everything just stopped, even my cell phone was off.  I could barley see anything as my eyes didn't have time to adjust to the darkness.  Across the road right at the tip of the tree line I saw a small orb-like object hovering and slowly changing color red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.  It hovered for about 15 seconds and then started moving rapidly in a square pattern around me, about 50 feet up for another 15 seconds. At this point, I remember feeling a warm paralyzing sensation through out my body. The next thing I remember is opening my eyes, and finding myself directly in front of the car tire with the tire iron in my hand.  The only difference was the time, it was 5:30 a.m. and starting to get light.  The spare was changed and leaning up against the car, I don't remember getting that far with the tire change.  I drove home in a state of shock and when I arrived in the house I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.  My right eye had a red mark on the outside corner; I had red marks in the back of my throat and soreness ((deleted)).  For the next 3 days, none of my body functions were operational, meaning I did not defecate or urinate for that period of time.  Usually, I am very regular.  Since that time I have not slept and my appetite has all but vanished.  My desire to study or do anything productive is gone. I am really scared that something has been done to me physically, or there is some underlying trauma that my mind is blocking out.  Please help me, I can't stop thinking about it, and I feel I am going crazy.  ((deleted/obscene)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

UNKNOWN FREAKY ORB DREW EYES, IMAGINATIONS ACROSS AREA   Earthlings, you've had an otherworldly experience, a cosmic encounter.  About 8 p.m. Wednesday, something peculiar flashed in the sky - something twinkly, something colorful, something eye-catching. Something strange. And blue. Or green. Or blue-green.  \"Bright blue-green ball with a white tail,\" says one man from Shelby, who spotted it just west of Blacksburg, S.C., after dinner at a Steak House.  \"A greenish-like light low in the sky,\" says a woman, driving home from church with her kids near Matthews. \"We thought a small plane or helicopter was going to crash.\"  \"A slow-moving bluish glow,\" says a man from Polkton and who watched it while soaking in his hot tub.  \"Large, bright green ball,\" says another man, who was headed to Chick-fil-A in Gastonia with his wife and four children after church. \"Had a haze about it.\"  \"Almost looked like a flare,\" reports a lady, who was on Interstate 485. \"Kind of creepy.\"  Venus, perhaps? It's often a suspect in UFO sightings, particularly when it's as bright as it is right now.  Not Venus. It vanished beneath the horizon about 7 p.m.  Stricken plane?  Nope. All aircraft accounted for.  Space junk? Errant satellite?  Negative, says NORAD. No re-entries of the sizable man-made objects they track.  OK. So ... alien object?  Bingo. But not the E.T. variety.  \"A fireball,\" says the observatory director and astronomy professor at Appalachian State University in Boone.  Based on the reports, the director believes it was an unusually bright meteor that burned up about 30 miles high in the atmosphere somewhere above Charlotte. Sightings came from more than 100 miles away.  Many witnesses say the light appeared to fizzle at the end and break into pieces, making it a special kind of fireball called a bolide. In the universe of meteors, they're A-List entertainers, known for their splashy finales.  Each day, an estimated 4 billion meteors burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Most are the size of sand grains, but rocks tumble in, too. NASA estimates that the Earth packs on several tons a day in meteors.  Some witnesses who contacted the Observer on Thursday wondered whether it could be debris from the recent anti-satellite test by China.  Probably not - but maybe, says a spokesman for the North American Aerospace Defense Command near Colorado Springs, Colo., which tracks satellites and space junk - everything from lost screwdrivers to astronaut gloves. He says he's been getting an unusually high number of calls this week about things spotted in the sky.  China's satellite-zapping exercise has probably increased space litter by about a million pieces, making it nearly as untidy as Interstate 77 in Charlotte.  \"It's anybody's guess,\" the spokesman says, \"what direction this stuff has gone.\"",

      "story": "Bright, spherical object flying over Charlotte, NC I was outside in a small park called The Green, located at 400 South Tryon Street in the middle of downtown Charlotte, NC, when I witnessed a single sphere flying in the sky approximately three miles south of my location, and approximately 2000 feet high.  The object was round and either white or silver in color.  It was quite far away, and very small, but definitely visible as the sun was positioned in the northeast sky and so was reflecting very well off the object.  The sky was filled with lots of clouds, but with much blue sky in between.  The day was bright and quite windy. I first noticed the orb moving in a straight horizontal line across the sky from northwest to southeast.  Given the proximity to Charlotte Douglas International Airport we see airplanes in the sky all the time, and initially I assumed that was the case here.  But the object did not look like a plane, even from a distance.  It was definitely round.   Within one minute of my first noticing the object, it slowed, then came to a complete stop. It hovered for a moment, then slowly descended.  I can only guess at the distance of the descent, but it must have been at least a couple hundred feet.  It was a smooth, seemingly controlled, descent that took less than one minute. The object hovered again for a couple of minutes.  It was not entirely stationary, rather it moved around a little bit, perhaps just moving with the wind.  It was very windy on the ground, so it was probably even more so up in the sky where the object was.  Even so, all of the movement I saw seemed very controlled and stable, not as though it were just a balloon being blown around. After this, the object started rising.  It rose back to its original height, in a mostly straight line, but now it was also moving south - away from me.  The object continued to rise while moving south for about 2 more minutes until I lost sight of it. The obvious conclusion is that this was just a balloon being driven by strong winds. And it may have been.  But the object was very visible even though it was very small and far away.   Perhaps a mylar balloon would have this effect, especially with the sun being opposite in the sky.  But given the distance it was from me, I really think the object was much larger than a balloon otherwise I would never have been able to see it. Also, the movements seemed very controlled; it was not being whipped about.  It's path may have been affected by the wind, but given that it initially was going in a straight line, slowed, stopped, descended, stopped then ascended in a uniform manner it just did not at all appear to be a balloon.",

It was dim, perhaps transparent; I could barely make it out.  I just noticed the movement - it would have been easy to miss.  It did not have any details or color I could make out.  My impression was that it was anywhere from a few feet from tip to tip to maybe 10 feet.  It seemed to be around 50 to 100 ft. away, moving 10-20 mph.  The bow center or angle corner was the front.  It moved silently in a straight line towards the south or southeast.  It went behind the trees, and I didn't see it again after that.  The total duration of the sighting was about five seconds. I will admit that what I saw could have very well been an owl or something (or even a trick of the eyes, e.g. a \"floater\"), but I cannot be certain, so I thought it would not hurt to report it, especially since I witnessed a very similar phenomena a year or two earlier.",

Thinking it was kids scoping out the yard/house for something to steal I sent my rotti out who did not react at all.

I then thought it was intentional, and having an X with a restraining order, I thought for a moment he had someone out there and ducked under a glass table, that\u2019s when the two parallel lights, about 10 ft off the ground, moving towards the house, went from a pinpoint white light, to a yellow silver dollar sized light, and I said, \u201c nothing does that, nothing moves parallel like that and comes at you!\u201d my friend ran out and said, \u201cthere is nothing behind it!\u201d I think meaning a light source. Still, my dog who goes off at squirrels, was not at all alarmed, and h! e\u2019s 70% blind. There was no sound.  But the two yellow lights came about 20 ft into my fence line, and when my friend got to where it was, it just stopped and was gone.  We got a mag light and looked behind the fence for footprints, but there were dead tree limbs I threw out a week ago, that obstructed the path and there were no broken limbs, even on dried, dead limbs.  There was no way for someone to stand near my fence and with the dramatic angle behind my house for someone to shine any light up my 20 degree angled yard without being at the fence line aiming up.    There was no sound and my dog never reacted as if anything was out there. It was the most amazing and unexplainable thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed.",

First, the craft was much too large to be pulled by a plane and had no text or picture of any kind. It was a flat dark gray color. From it's position relative to mine and the apparent size in the sky, it appeared to be much larger than an airliner. I drove down Lawyers Road toward NC 27 to get a closer look at the object as it appeared to drift westward. I did not seem to be getting any closer to the craft as it was still a considerable distance away when I got to NC 27. I turned around and returned to Mint Hill and was unable to see the craft once I had stopped again. About 15-20 minutes later, I was outdoors again and looked to the north to see if the craft was visible. The craft was emerging from behind a cloud on the horizon, which gave good indication of it's distance. There were very few clouds in the sky. The craft appeared much smaller, probably further away.

Just before the Sighting ended, I noticed another Ball just East of the 1st one. After maybe 20 Seconds, they both just Vanished. You could see them kind of Fade Out of sight.

      "story": "Strange balls of light in the sky On this particular incident, me and my sister were outside on my balcony in South Charlotte, NC.  I happened to be telling her that she should observe what goes on in the sky at night.  The skies were clear and we could see the stars very well.  I have on two other occasions, in Virginia Beach, have witnessed an incident of a ball of light that I could not explain what it was.  While staring over the night sky, I noticed a light, that was, it seemed to me was trying to disguise itself as a star.  It was like at first glance it looked like a star but after staring at it, I could tell that it was not outside of this atmosphere.  Then it started to move.  It moved horizontally thru the sky, It was completely silent.  It was far away.  We lived in an area that was in a busy flight/landing path of the Charlotte Douglas Airport. There was not a flashing light on this object as airplanes have.  As it moved, it was on a horizontal glide and trailing it was a faint t! rial of light.  It definately was not exhauaust from a plane that will linger after the plane passes.  This light was like a smear behind this object that was flying.  There was no 'exhaust' trail left behind. The further it traveled across the sky, the dimmer the light was.  I have seen many shooting stars and meteor showers and cannot compare this object to what I saw.  I know that it was not ordinary because my sister was becoming uncomfortable looking at it. This object was not a sudden fade like a shooting star...This was a calculated, dimming of the light that I had witnessed before. The very first time I had seen something like this was at my home in Virginia Beach, VA...Right near the Chesapeake border.  I have always liked looking up at the stars and one day I stepped out of my house to smoke a cigarette and while waiting for my sister to come outside, I looked straight up.  That is when I saw a star that was very bright but it has a dull yellowish tint to the light....it was not pure white light like a star...but it looked like a star.  I stared at this object for about a minute and then it started to move. First a slow sway back and forth then it started raising it's elevation.  Even though it did not look like the size was shrinking siginficantly I could tell that the swaying was moving away from me.  For about 30 seconds, this object swayed back and forth like a metronome and as it swayed the ligth gradually got fainter and fainter until it was completely gone.  There was no noise and I know that this object was not a plane or a helicopter. After that, also in Virginia at the same home, I went outside on the porch again to smoke a cigarette.  This time it was right about when the sun was going down.  The sun would set behind my home and it was down far enough that the only thing that was lit was the sky.  The shadows from the house and trees were at their max 'stretch'.  I looked over to my right at the sky.  Some stars were already visible.  I saw this one star that was unusually bright that I know was not the North Star.  It just seemed like it was out of place. We lived in this home for almost 30 years and I had never noticed a star that bright in that area of the sky at that time of the day before.   While staring at this object after about two minutes, I noticed that it was moving...back and forth...It was almost like it moved becuase I wouldn't stop staring at it.  The way that it moved back and forth, made me feel like it was staring at me too.  There was no noise and this light was a perfect sphere.  It ! didn't twinkle like other stars.  As it moved back and forth, I could clearly see that it was raising its elevation and that same trail of light was following it. The higher it climbed, the dimmer it got, still bouncing back and forth until it completely disappeared.  That took about a minute or two from the time that it started moving for it to fade completely out and when the light was completely gone, there was nothing that made me think it was a plane or chopper or any other man-made vehicle.  It is disturbing that I have had three incidents that I have seen an object flying in the sky that I could not identify.  I am originally from Virginia Beach and this is a highly active military area w/ airforce bases and naval bases nearby.  I am not a stranger to seeling military planes and have also seen a stealth bomber fly by...  These objects were not planes. Hopefully this information will be helpful to you in your research.  One thing that resignated with me from watching programs about UFO's is that if there is a race of anything in outer space that has the capability to make it to our planet, how so far we are behind in their technology as we cannot get a human past the moon.

      "story": "3 Glowing Orbs glide across the night sky in triangle shape. Friday, January 6th, 2012 Charlotte, NC 28209  \t A group of friends and I were playing a game of night Frisbee at the local middle school.  At approximately 9:15 pm someone shouted, \"Look up at the sky!\"  We all shifted out attention to the clear dark sky, where 3 balls of white light were swiftly gliding in perfect unison.  Even more bizarre, was how these foreign balls of light moved.  Not only did they glide with a solid white glow, (didn't flash like an airplane), they moved in a perfectly symmetrical equilateral triangle shape.  One light guided the other two across the sky, all of which appeared to be the exact same distance from one another, forming three perfect 45 degree angles. We were all dumbstruck by the phenomenon and attempted to make sense of it while continuing to admire its beauty.  Each of us announced our individual ideas in hopes of deriving a logical explanation for the triangles existence, whilst smothering the immediate idea that lingered in all of our hearts - could it be a UFO? \tPerhaps it just seemed too unlikely for us to be blessed enough to actually witness, first-hand, a true UFO sighting.  I remember watching the lights glide across the sky and debating whether or not to take a picture from my phone, not wanting to appear juvenile, I decided against it. After watching the lights glide for approximately one minute, the rear two lights began to reduce their distance apart from each other making the guiding light's angle (Far Right) more acute and the other two light's angles more obtuse (Left & Center).  The possibility that their paths were not predetermined by the front light (Far Right) began to cross our minds.  However, surely enough the rear lights settled into their new position and the three glowing lights maintained there new triangular shape and continued to travel across the night sky, once again, in perfect unison.  This proceeded for approximately 30 seconds.  Then, the far left light suddenly vanished from sight. The group burst into uproar, attempting to decipher the cause of the disappearance.  The consensus from the other witnesses was that it must have disappeared behind some clouds.  However, I was not convinced for two reasons. First, the sky appeared completely absent of clouds, no reflection from the moons glow indicated any cloudy haze whatsoever.  Secondly, even if it did disappear behind the clouds, eventually it would have reappeared - it never did. Approximately 15-20 seconds after the far left glow disappeared from sight, the front guiding light also disappeared (Far Right).  Leaving the last light to dwindle for approximately 20 seconds until it, too, disappeared.   The lights never revealed themselves to us again. One day later, a friend of ours who was at a neighboring mall the night of the occurrence, approximately 3-4 miles a way from our sighting, also saw the glowing orbs in the sky that night.  He took a picture of his findings and sent it to us; it is the image that I have sent you. I researched the phenomenon somewhat and have found other sightings of these glowing orbs in the North Carolina area.  I hope that my story proved interesting, feel free to contact me about any questions you might have.",

It was then that one of the wives exclaimed there were more coming, and sure enough 3 or 4 more appeared from behind the treeline and followed the same path at the same speed.  More kept coming in random intervals for the next couple minutes, sometimes only 2 at a time, sometimes up to 5.  There were no patterns I could discern except for a couple groups seemingly forming a perfect triangle.  There were about a couple dozen total over the course of 3 or 4 minutes.  We managed to get videos on cell phone cameras, but they are what you would expect from filming with such a device against a dark sky. We were amazed and baffled to the point that we called 911.  While we admitted to the officer who came out that we felt a little silly calling and that we had been drinking all night, we felt a burning need to let authorities know what we had seen. I checked wind direction for that time frame, and it was blowing South at 5 mph which pretty much discounts the possibility of chinese lanterns or flares.  I have absolutely no clue what these things could have been, and I feel very fortunate that I had friends with me to witness this.  We are all in our 30s and have careers in retail, insurance and teaching.  I am sharing this experience in the hopes that someone else saw these and can possibly explain what they were.  The random formations discount (to me) the possiblility of military aircraft, the wind direction rules out lanterns or flares, it was a clear night so they weren't reflections, and no trails tell me they weren't meteors.   Absolutely unexplainable, and the quantity made it somewhat of a scary experience.   For a brief time I wasn't sure if they would stop coming. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness.  We found him to be exceptionally objective about the sighting, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD))",

Now with all this end of the world hooey going around I was starting to get a bit worried.  Then I realized this event probably wouldn't include me.  So I paid more attention to the object.  It was really fast and left no contrail, so I don't believe it was a plane.  I nearly had to lay down on the parking lot to keep a track on it!  It eventually moved out of my field of vision. I have never seen anything move that fast!  I am not a spring chicken and have seen a lot of stuff in my days, but this takes the proverbial cake.  I went on the party and didn't say a word about it... I am not sure what it was, but thought I'd report it.  Thanks for listening.",

My Golden Retriever approach the area of &quot;fly-up&quot; very slowly, sniffing the aire and walking very slowly.   My German Shepherd at the same time was slowly approaching the area looking upwards and moving in a questioning manner. It was very dark outback, however I had flipped on the back lights, that lit up the yard for me watch the dogs from the porch.   And, I was on the porch frozen and quizzled as to what in the world I had just seen.  I have questioned different people about what this could possibly be.   A large owl, osprey were the answers.  I have bird watched quite a bit and know my silhouettes.   This shape does not match any bird descriptor I have referenced or observed.  There were no flapping wings or wing spread nor was there a tail visible.  I did find however, bird feathers of birds possibly consumed. It's the triangular shape that has me puzzled.  And, the power this thing had to have to leap to a higher branch or line.  I stayed on the porch frozen while my dogs continued to sniff and look upwards.  They finally gave up did their business and came in.  I could not sleep all thinking about what this thing could be.  When I question or tell other people about this experience I am laughed at or brushed off with a silly look or remark.  I know what I saw.  And, if the dogs could talk they would back me up!",

After about the third or fourth occurrence, I looked at the southeast part of the sky and something completely different.  It was an unmoving white light, brighter than the moon. It was disk to oval shaped, kind of oblong.  The moon was out on this occasion and it was full so im not sure what i actually saw there, but it wasnt swamp gas or venus.  And once again after a few minutes the light simply went out.  More recently, it was a lot closer than usual and had a kind of hazy spotlight projecting in front of it.

Our location was somewhere close to South Carolina and North Carlina line (?).   A row of 3 or so white lights appeared just in front of our vehicle approx 3 to 5 hundreds yards (?) away traveling at a smooth but very quick speed.  It crossed from left to right from a cell tower to another tower on other side of expressway.  It then proceeded to travel back across highway toward another cell tower further down the highway, then traveled south bound, following I-85 until it eventually dissappeared from our view on the horizon. It took about 12 to 17 seconds from first site to end of site.  No sounds, no hesitation, just a very smooth flight.  The row of lights never changed even though it moved from right to left then left to right, then traveling straight away from us.   I've never encountered anything like this before and has me checking the skies most nights.  I've searched online for sitings on this date but not found any such reports.   My grandson and I agreed the speed to be extremely fast due to the time it took to travel from our location to horizon, which we couldn't agree on.  He seemed to think the horizon was 50 or more miles away and I thought it could be no more than 10 miles away.   Even at 5 miles an object to travel that far in less than 12 to 17 seconds would be traveling at a very high rate of speed.",

First, this thing was massive, maybe the size of 5 airplanes in the sky.   Secondly, this flying object was not lit up at all and was very difficult to see (you wouldn't even notice it if you were just glancing at the sky).   I couldn't believe what I was seeing and expected it to  be gone in a flash, but after a few seconds I called out for my girlfriend to come see and she came out.

      "story": "Small kidney bean shaped UFO over plaza-midwood (east side of charlotte) midmorning Two of us (one adult male and one adult female) were witnesses to this sighting.  At the intersection of North Davidson and 11th street, near the onramp to 277 we observed an object hovering stationary in the sky toward the East/South, roughly over the Eastern side of Plaza- Midwood area, could be directly over Central and Hawthorne. It was on a Monday morning at around 8:55 AM.   Upon entering 277, we watched the object stay stationary and kept it in visual range until the beltway passed the exit for 4th and 3rd street, roughly 2 minutes.  During that time the object did not change position.  It struck us as odd because it was not behaving like an airplane or bird, and was too low in the sky for an airplane other than for an approach to landing or takeoff.  It was in the right location for a large bird, but it was not flapping any wings or gliding.   The oddest part was the shape, which is difficult to describe but I will do my best:  It was kind of a lopsided \"kidney bean\" shape, vertically oriented and proportioned so that the upper half was slightly larger than the other, rounded, and slightly curved or -c shaped.   It was too far away to make out any discernible details, but it appeared to have a surface texture or facets, and did not appear smooth and shiny. After we were out of visual range, and I was dropped off at work, my counterpart returned to the area about 10 minutes later, but the object was missing.",

The aliens were making a very high-pitched sound and it was very fast. the only way to describe the sound was that it was (di ga diggi di ---a digga dii ga di) repeating over and over again like frequency.   The alien did have the typical big eyes but not the same shape head as seen on tv for a typical alien.  The alien was white or a tannish color rounder shaped oval head.  It had the typical alien nose but the mouth was bigger and wider.  I was paralyzed but could only move my eyes and also there was one behind me because I was laying on my side rocking me back and forth.  I was trying to break free but could not move and then wend fully unconscious.  I do remember being levitated and pulled or dragged out of my bed.  The next day I went downstairs and asked my nephew did he sleep ok that night.  He said to me unc I could hardly sleep there was this giggi diggi di sound going on and I thought! it was the radio. Well later that day I went into the shower and when i came out I gasped and my heart started beating fast.  There were patterns all over my body red scratches hand prints and they stung a little.  I called my sister who took picture, I as well took pictures and had a friend of mine with a high quality camera come and take pictures of all the patterns on my body.  I have been visited before but NEVER has it been like this.  My friend said man they really got you and he was in shock.  He said it looks like someone strapped you down to do all of this.

      "story": "Saw 3 objects in sky and a creature. UFO sighting, chase and possible abduction.  Charlotte N.C., May 5th, 2014. I am submitting this report because I feel that people should know what my adult daughter (28 years old) and I went through.  After over three weeks later we are still upset and still not our usual selves.  I guess we are both still in shock and we are not sure what to do about it. It\u2019s hard because we only really have each other to talk to about it and my daughter is still having stomach problems and just wants to forget what we saw.  I can\u2019t get it out of my mind.  I am still scared. I still can\u2019t believe that it happened at all.  But, I know it did! We know it did. On May 5th, 2014, around 8:30-8:45 PM, we were driving through Charlotte, NC, on the Southbound side of I- 77.  I noticed a really bright light off to the right of us up in the sky.  This huge thing was just floating there in the sky.  It was no plane.  It was silent.  My daughter was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  I just kept asking, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d  Her reply was that it was a plane because it had blinking lights.  It did have blinking lights but they were pretty insignificant compared to the huge bright white string of lights that seemed to be at the front of this thing.  The smaller lights looked like they were on top of it. One to each side of the center.  The white lights were very large.  I couldn\u2019t see past the lights to see what shape the object was.  We were kind of arguing about what it could or could not be. I grabbed my cell and took some photos.  I actually caught two pictures of the lights and I also turned on my cell\u2019s video to try and catch it that way.  I caught it on video too but it is very small and all you can see is a white light off in the distance.  It\u2019s pretty shaky.  I\u2019m not sure if I can pull it in to see it better or not. As we drove through Charlotte on 77 we came to an area where there are street lights right next to the highway.  Tall orange/yellow street lights.  I could no longer see the object because the street lights were so bright.  All of a sudden a huge round ball of solid bright white light came right at the windshield.  Out of nowhere! It took up most of the windshield and she drives a four door Toyota Corolla.  When it came for the windshield I braced myself for impact. But it didn\u2019t hit the car.  It just kind of seemed as though it evaporated into it.   At that moment my daughter was driving over 70 mph.    As I sat there dazed, I was thinking that one of the street lights must\u2019ve fallen on the car but there was no sound at all and I was having a hard time trying to grasp what had just happened.  I hadn\u2019t said a word to my daughter about the light when she asked me, \u201cWhat was that light?\u201d  I was like, \u201cYou saw that too?\u201d  Then I told her \u201cI don\u2019t know what that was!\u201d   That scared us pretty badly.  Her stomach started to hurt really bad and she was nauseous and my stomach was hurting too.  It seemed to just take all of my daughter\u2019s energy away. She started feeling really bad.  Not only did this light scare the crap out of us but it \u201cSTUNNED\u201d us.  We were actually dazed by it.  We don\u2019t know where the ball of light came from, but we didn\u2019t see it again.  We both remember actually feeling it on the skin of our faces and upper arms. I remember that I looked in the side mirror a few moments later and nothing was there.   A little while later a huge helicopter flew right over and in front of our car. It was so close that we could see the two greenish/blue light domes stuck underneath it and a tiny little blue light on top of it, under the blades.  It was a huge helicopter and it was very loud. Because of the blue light I thought it must be police or military. All in all we saw the chopper three times or three different choppers. They were circling the area where we were. So, we couldn\u2019t have been the only ones who witnessed the object. Not sure if anyone saw the round light that came after us. I did notice that the helicopters didn\u2019t actually seem to approach the white lights that were still in the sky. They just circled around the interstate. The last time I saw one of these helicopters was when we were leaving the Charlotte area. Once we cleared the street lights we could still see the lights in the sky were still there. Then the road turned so that the object ended up behind us. I was determined to get some pictures of it so we took the next exit so that we could see it from on top of the over pass. Well, the next exit didn\u2019t go up to an overpass. It angled down. We ended up surrounded by trees and buildings. So, we couldn\u2019t see it anymore. We were going to go to the next exit to see if it had an actual overpass where we would be able to see it again and that\u2019s when my husband called. It was 9:08 PM. I frantically told him all about the lights in the sky and the ball of light that came at us and about the helicopter. I wasn\u2019t paying any attention to my daughter who was still driving until she said, \u201cMom, I don\u2019t feel good!\u201d  That\u2019s when I noticed she was driving about 85 mph and she told me that she couldn\u2019t stay awake. I told her to slow down. I got off of the phone.  She told me that she had been nodding off and that she couldn\u2019t drive anymore.  We had eaten in Huntersville and we left at dusk.  I\u2019d say a little after 8:00 PM, she was full of energy.  Our trip to where she lives was only 3 \u00bd hours away from Huntersville and she was fine.  She was fine until the white ball of light came at us. I told her to pull off of the interstate so that she could rest and that I would drive the rest of the way.  The exit we took had a Denny\u2019s so we went in there. This Denny\u2019s is located in Rock Hill, S.C.  As soon as we walked in, we realized it was freezing.  So, we reluctantly walked back outside to the car and opened the trunk to get our jackets.  Everything in the trunk was hot. Even the metal of my camera\u2019s tripod was hot to the touch.  Our jackets were toasty as though we had just pulled them out of the drier.  That was when we started to worry about radiation.  Worried about where that ball of light might\u2019ve come from. Everything being so hot really shook us up all over again. (We don\u2019t know where to go to have something like that checked out. Who do you call to see if your car or you have been exposed to radiation? If anyone out there knows; please get the information to me.) When we went back inside we sat down and ordered coffee. We sat there trying to rationalize what had happened. She was still nauseous so she decided to get something to eat hoping she would feel better. I didn\u2019t eat. My stomach felt bad and I had no appetite at all. Strange thing is that the clock on her cell and the register receipt didn\u2019t match. The receipt said we left there at 10:05 and my daughter had gotten a call from her husband while we were at the table and the time read 10:46. That would mean that by her cell we left there after 11:00 PM. I know we weren\u2019t sitting there for that long. I called the Denny\u2019s last week and spoke to a manager to see of the register\u2019s time was off. But, it was accurate. I can\u2019t explain the difference. I wish I could say that our experience ended there. But, it didn\u2019t. We got into the car and I drove back to I-77.  After I had been driving a little while, I spotted the lights again. We couldn\u2019t believe it!  They were over to the right of the interstate, just like before.  (When we had left the restaurant I made sure that we got my video camera and Cannon camera out of the trunk.)  So, I told my daughter to grab it to film the object, so she did. I couldn\u2019t help her with it because I was driving.  As she opened the view finder she tried to focus on the object when it seemed to come straight towards our car! She just said \u201c It can see us, it\u2019s looking at us!\u201d She said the white lights went out and now there was a line of red lights under it. Then it flew over the car. It went from the front passenger side to the rear driver side and then across the street. By this time it was moving very slowly and low. The whole thing turned slowly like it was facing our car while staying in the! same spot. She is so scared and at this time I can\u2019t see it. She can, because she is looking over the seat through the window behind me. I pull the car off to the right side of the slow lane. Strangely there is no traffic except for us. Now, I can see it! As we watch this thing together; it started changing shape. I ask you, how does something just change shape? The fact that it was in the air is what scared me! We could see what looked like metal beams drop down from I guess inside of this thing and it looked like they were interlocking. The beams looked like 2 x4s but seemed to be made of metal. It was changing shape right in front of us. We could clearly see it because it was right there and the red lights illuminated it. It\u2019s outer shape was starting to look like some sort of a triangle. That\u2019s when I put the car back into drive, hit the gas and took off. I need to say this now; my daughter doesn\u2019t own and has never used a video camera. (Except for one time when I was recording something and handed it over to her to use.)She thought that just because the view finder lights up and the screen is showing what you are pointing at that what you see is being recorded. She never hit the little red button. Later when we realized this we were crushed. I do not blame my daughter. Now, here is where I made the worst decision of my life. At this time we are in South Carolina and are between Rock Hills and Columbia. As before, I wanted to see more of the object so since it was behind us I started to look for an overpass again so that we could sit up high and maybe my daughter could get some more footage of this thing. When I took the overpass to the right, stopped at the stop sign then headed left onto the bridge/over pass as we looked at the trees in front of us there was a large glowing hovering bright creamy white object that was about 50 feet wide if not more. I don\u2019t know if it was the same object we had just seen but if it was it had changed color and shape again and was chasing us and waiting for us. As soon as I saw it I slammed on the brakes. I remember hearing the sand and gravel crunch under the tires as I skidded to a stop. I had driven all the way across the bridge and was sitting in the middle of the road on painted lines that showed that ! the lanes were separate. We were in shock. It was at tree level and we could see the outline of the tops of the trees on both sides of the road. I could see that the road we were on went in between those trees and looked like it headed off to the right. There were no lights anywhere on or around this overpass. We were just sitting there, stunned.  Staring at that bright light. When my daughter said, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going near that thing? Are you?\u201d I told her no. But, as I realized later; I still wasn\u2019t leaving either. I can\u2019t explain that. I was terrified but I wasn\u2019t leaving. I don\u2019t know how long we sat there. I think it was just a few minutes. Then we were hit with headlights from the right side of us. Someone had taken the exit from North bound side and had pulled up to the stop sign facing right at our car. That snapped me out of it. I took my foot off of the brake and swerved to the right and around to the left to make a u turn in the street and headed for the ramp back to I-77 South. I am ashamed to say that we did nothing to alert the other car. We have no idea if these people saw it or not. All I know is that the object was still there when I took my u turn. I never looked back. Once back on the interstate I drove for quite some time when finally I just had to pull off. By this time it was after midnight. I took a well lit exit and saw a Wendy\u2019s but it was only open for drive through. All of the gas stations were closed. All the while I\u2019m checking the skies. So, I got back on I-77 and looked for another exit. That\u2019s when I saw a Shell station sign and took that exit. It was on the left side so we had to go over the overpass. We could tell it was closed as soon as we came over the overpass. All of the parking lot lights were on but it was closed. I was in pain because my bladder was hurting now. I pulled partially into the entrance of the Shell station and then made a u turn. As I completed the u turn we saw a guard rail right in front of us. At the very end of the guard rail as we were swinging around we saw something  standing there. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of it. It was right next to the road. Right next to the door of the car. It seemed to be! bristling. Like it was luminescent in some way, but it was really darkly colored like it was camouflaged. I actually thought it was someone dressed up in that camouflage netting stuff when it moved towards the glass right next to my daughter. She put her hands and arms up over her face and head and tucked her head downwards. That is how close that thing was to her door. I honestly thought it may have been a poacher until I could make out the shape of it. I could see a larger than normal rounded top of a head then it came down to a short little neck area then straight out to both sides to shoulders. (Human shoulders aren\u2019t shaped that way.) Then it\u2019s arms dropped straight down.  The thing that made me realize that it wasn\u2019t human was mostly that it\u2019s waist was only like 8 inches wide and that it was about maybe 4 feet tall.  I could see from the top of it\u2019s head to its hip area through her window.  I remember thinking \u201cIt\u2019s so skinny!\u201d Next thing I know we are past it and my  daughter is asking me, \u201cWas that a person?\u201d  I remember looking  back over my right shoulder through the window behind her and still seeing the thing.  It was moving and I had never been so terrified in my entire life.  My daughter said that she didn\u2019t look at it but then moments later she said that it was really thin.  I remember asking her how do you know that if you didn\u2019t look at it?  She still can\u2019t answer that question, but is adamant about not looking at it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and she assures us that the report is sincere.  She will have her daughter submit a supplementary report.  The mother has offered to send two photos she asserts she took of the object(s).  PD)) I somehow find the ramp back to the interstate and just drive. Finally, I spot what looks like a truck stop. I know they are open 24/7. As we take the exit there are semi\u2019s parked to the right side of the exit. As I passed them I could see that it was open and now I had a place to use the rest room.  Even after seeing that thing I had to use the bathroom so I just had to stop.  Once I was finished inside I came back outside to the car.  We sat there for a couple of moments trying to absorb what we had just seen. I didn\u2019t know what time it was then and just got back on the road.  My daughter had to get back home that night because there was no one home to take her three dogs outside to the bathroom.  That is the reason we hadn\u2019t stopped and gotten a hotel. While driving I ran into construction three separate times where signs with arrows pointed us over to the slow lane and the speed limit was only 45.  After the third road maintenance/construction site I had had it.  I told my daughter that I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.  I had to pull off and get a hotel.  Two exits later we found hotels and stopped for the night.  It was 2:00 AM.  The hotel was in Orangeburg, SC.  We were so shook up that we didn\u2019t get to sleep until 5:00 AM.  We turned all of the lights on in the room and bathroom. We jumped at every little sound.  Even sounds the little refrigerator made.  I woke up at 6:00 AM and realized that we had fallen asleep.  We were both sitting up leaning on pillows stacked up against the headboards.  I finally turned off the room lights when the sun came up enough to light the room. I just can\u2019t get the image of the creepy little thing out of my mind.  Even right now, I can still clearly see it in my mind.  Every time I get the same feeling of outright fear.  We think we were still being followed.  Then again, maybe this creature was separate.  We don\u2019t know. I do guess that the larger lights that we saw were not what we saw change shape.  That object was much, much smaller.  So was the glowing light we saw at that over pass. We are still afraid. Writing this down has taken me all day long.  It\u2019s still very upsetting. We don\u2019t understand why it chose us.  Was it that we were taking too much interest?  Again, that would be totally my fault.  At points during all of this she was begging me to get far away from what we were seeing. All in all it took us four hours to get 1 hour and 43 minutes away.  The time it usually takes to drive from Rock Hill to Orangeburg.  We got off of the road a couple of times but still feel that we are missing time somewhere. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Can you tell me where people who have witnessed a UFO go when they want to speak out loud to someone about what they saw? Do people ever get answers to what happened? It took me about 7 hours to physically write down all of what happened that night. It was very hard to have to keep reliving it so that I could write it down. My daughter and I went over it a hundred times while I was still at her house but now it's like pulling teeth to get her to talk about any of it. She feels that we never should have been there. Never should have seen what we saw and that we shouldn't tell anyone. She doesn't understand why I feel the need to let people know what happened to us. What we witnessed I think it's important! All of it!  I want to know what that ball of light was!  Did it leave radiation in/on her car? What happened to my left ear?  Why is there a \"New\" bump behind my right ear and why does my daughter have one in the same area? Why were my triglycerides through the roof when my blood was tested 7 days after May 5th? They were so high that my doctor called me at home to give me the results. I remember that I was asked by the tech' when my blood was drawn if I was on any blood thinners when he drew my blood. I am not!  I am still very scared at night.  If I have to go outside for something alone at night now, It takes everything I have not to fly into a panic and run when I see any lights moving in the sky.  What if it knows where I am or worse, where my daughter is?  Please, accept my apology for being so rude in my reply to your email before.  I have not been myself lately.  ((END ADDENDUM))",

      "story": "Black, morphing shape object sighted for almost ten minutes with my neighbor in plain sight. I have never really believed in this sort of thing, but I just saw an object in the sky over south Charlotte at 8:00 p.m., 6/15/2014.  It was black and seemed to be a semi-circular shape but seemed to change shape in a slow, wobbly manner.  Almost like a blob or jellyish type structure.  It did not look natural. It either had a bright white light or some sort of reflection of the sun, but it was slowly spinning so the light would come and go. It was directly over me and in plain sight at low altitude.  Someone with terrible eyesight could have easily seen it.  I watched it for over five minutes, probably closer to ten.  It moved very slowly, gaining in altitude pretty steeply in regard to how quickly it became too difficult to see.  I recorded it from my phone, but it has no zoom.  By the time I decided to find my phone and record, it had floated quite a distance.  It was indistinguishable on the screen because of its altitude and the sun and lack of zooming ability.   My neighbor walked out as I was filming.  He watched it with me.  By the time he saw it, the object was at a greater distance and higher altitude so he asked if maybe it was a weather balloon.  It was not, though.  It was almost thickly transparent-like, but then it would \u201cmorph\u201d into a jet black with absolutely no plasma look to it.  It did not look like it was \u201cmade of matter\u201d in the sense that we usually perceive matter. I am somewhat shocked because I am a hard sceptic of almost any phenomena reported on any subject.  I called the airport.  They said that they know of nothing in the sky, that there is a National Guard Base nearby.  Really though, I\u2019m not sure why I called them because this \u201cobject\u201d did not look natural and moved in a very unnatural manner as well.  It was not a \u201cvehicle\u201d per se.  I am truly at a loss for words. I saw it earlier this week too, but it was very far away so I didn\u2019t call or make a report because I wasn\u2019t sure what I saw.  On that day, it seemed to hover in a completely still position and darted off at an extremely high speed.  I was intrigued as to what it could be, but it was very far away and pretty much a small, dark spot in the sky.  I am certain now that this was this object or something very similar that I observed.",

      "story": "Multiple lights and strange star like objects seen. I was outside on my back porch having a cigarette and some coffee early that morning while it was still dark and noticed a formation of whitish blue colored star like objects in a formation moving left across the night sky.  Some of them would push in closer to the other or move up higher.   I also noticed to my right another whitish blue object that was actually bigger than the other objects to the left and it seemed to be moving upwards in the sky and would dim it's lights and then become faint then glow really bright. I think that particular light was originally lower in the sky and when i looked at it through my binoculars it seemed to be shaped like a spherical galaxy or what you would call a saucer.   The most eerie aspect of these sightings was the last object i saw not far from that one which was a yellow light that was the same size as the blue whitish one and it was also moving across the sky even farther right to the last one.  It was a yellow color but! it flickered red at first as if it had rotating orb like lights on it and i thought i noticed it rotating as i looked at it through my binoculars but it was hard to say for certain from that distance. Upon closer inspection it seemed as though it may have been shaped like a cone or and upside down pyramid of sorts.  The light rays coming from it even bent like it had a very different shape than any average type of aircraft upside down boomerang.  I thought it looked strange.  It seemed to change it's direction a lot.  It would continue its path to the right yet it would simultaneously be going up but then seem to go towards the left.   My brother also saw this as he was with me at the time and we were talking out on the back porch when i pointed it out to him.  One last thing that i noticed while this was happening was a sudden flash of blue light that radiated out like a perfect circle from a very small circular point in the sky and it was in between the objects that were seper! ated by distance. It also happened to be in the middle of clou! ds.  I ca n rule out thunder or lightning because it never followed suit with more flashes or any thunder or rain.  The sky was clear save for a few clouds and the flash was a circular shape and very bright.  I do live close to an airport but i did not hear any sounds whatsoever and they were all sighted very high in the night sky.   This happened on Tuesday the 29th of July 2014.",

      "story": "Multi-colored flashing lights around a stationary orb My friend called me to report two bright \"stars\" in the sky flashing multi-colored lights. He gave me the approximate location so I went outside with my phone and binoculars and saw the larger orb.  I could see the flashing lights with my naked eye - green, red, white, blue. When I used my binoculars, they were very bright and clear, like an LED light, not blurry, and flashing in a rotating pattern around a glowing orb. I live near a flight line and witnessed several planes pass by.  This was not a plane.  It hovered in the same spot for about fifteen minutes and then began to slowly drift south.  Not fast.  I could barely tell it was moving. At one point it disappeared then reappeared within a few seconds.  As it drifted south, the flashing lights lessened in intensity.  I could only see them with binoculars at that point as the light seemed to be getting a bit smaller and looked more like a bright star to the naked eye. I brought my husband outside to w! itness the phenomena.  He is ex military and said it was not a plane or helicopter.  There was no sound. I took a video with my phone.  Granted, it's not the greatest and the orb looks small but you can still see the flashing lights.  I'm not sure what it was.  I've tried to debunk but honestly, I can't come up with an answer.  At one point on the video, I describe it as resembling a flashing Christmas tree full of multi-colored lights. What impressed me most was the brilliance of the lights.  It may not be anything but I wanted to report it since it was so unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Sirius.  PD))",

It must have been 30 minutes-1 hour out of Charlotte, while flying over a very big lake that looked like a scar in the ground, when I saw it.  It was a small white object.  It was hovering, and the plane was passing over it.   It wasn't a helicopter, and it was just bellow the clouds, so it couldn't have been a commercial drone.  It almost looked like a shark.   It was white, and had a small tail fin, which went into an oval shaped body with kind of a dark center.  From the small oval shape, it looked like a sideways wing was jutting out (like if a plane was flipping left, and the wing was sticking out at an angle).   It did not look very big, and I continued to look at it until our plane passed it entirely.  It was moving, but very slowly, slower than cloud speed, and it was just sort of hovering there.  I would have taken a picture, but my phone was dead, which is ironic timing. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Yes it was around 8:15-8:30 AM.  No one but me saw it (that I'm aware of).  I was flying by myself and didn't really want to be that freak in the window seat who was trying to get people to look at the UFO haha. It's amazing to me how many reported sightings there are.

Around 12:30 in the afternoon, I and one other person noticed a round metallic object hovering in the sky.  I'm making an educated guess based on the cirrus clouds in the sky with the object, that it was around 17000 feet in the air.   Although it was so high it was very easy to notice because it had a very shiny, metallic surface (like tin foil or stainless steel) and reflected the sunlight.  It appeared to be a single, solid object.  I am unable to to determine how large it was, only that it was very easy to see, as the sky was almost totally clear.   The object made no sound as it hung there motionless for about 1 minute.  I had enough time to point the object out to my friend and give him at least 20 uninterrupted seconds to observe it too.   The object then took off so fast that it almost seemed to have disappeared.  It left so quickly that I would have missed it had been blinking.   At that point I realized what we saw wasn't an aircraft.",

I can best describe it as shaped liked Saturn.   It was round in the middle, a ball almost with the typical disc shape around it.  It had rotating lights around the perimeter of the disk portion of it and the front of the top of the circular area towards the left of the craft.   I don't know if anyone else on the flight saw it but I know for a fact that I saw it. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I wasn't able to take a picture.

      "story": "My wife and I lived on Lake Norman from late 1992 to mid 2002.  Starting around 1998 we began to notice silver egg-shaped objects following aircraft around Charlotte International Airport.  I would estimate dozens of clear sightings from 1998 until 2001.  Most of the sightings were on clear, sunny days but some on cloudy, overcast days.  The craft were mostly viewed following south to north, which would be more with departing aircraft but on occasion they would follow aircraft on high-approach, north to south.  Sometimes above and behind and sometimes below and behind. I am ex-career Air Force so I have a pretty good knowledge of aircraft and flight behavior.  This was always a formation type pursuit as if they were pacing the aircraft.  If I were to judge distance I would estimate up to a quarter of a mile behind at times but on occasion we would see one directly above or below usually 300+ feet from the aircraft.   Objects would pace the aircraft from seconds to a few minutes and sometimes it was not uncommon to see the object switch and follow another aircraft.  This would go on from five to ten minutes and sometimes more.  Altitudes generally ranged from 3000 feet up to 5000 feet. The objects were always silver-metallic and egg shaped.  About a third of the size of the aircraft, generally a commercial airliner, 135 or DC-10.  There were no other markings on the object but you could clearly see it was sphere shaped and no flat surfaces visible.  A very polished and smooth looking object.  When the object left it was in an instant like a bolt of lightning.  Just a streak across the sky and then gone!  Can't imagine the G-Force it had to undergo when it disappeared. Never did set a pattern to when they would appear but it was often enough that neighbors and people we knew from around the general area would see them and talk about it.  Occasionally would witness objects with pulsating, multi-colored lights pacing aircraft at night but not very often.   Spent most of my young adult life on or around Air Force bases but have never witnessed anything like that before, or since I left the Lake Norman area.

I tried my best to catch a better glimpse of it and when I did catch a better glimpse the object in question had changed from a triangle pyramid like structure to a straight line in the sky.  I stared at this in awe for a moment, tried to make sense of it.  I almost missed my exit from staring for so long.  Just as i was turning each light appeared to leave a long trail behind it connecting to the next as if they were all moving in unison.  When I had merged onto I-85 southbound the structure was now behind me and I could no longer see it however I obsessed over the thought of it on the rest of the way home, and filed this report immediately.

On an American Airlines flight \"Leg\" with my wife and daughter from Orlando, FL, to Charlotte, NC, I looked out my window as the airplane was slowing and beginning its decent to the airport (at cloud altitude) on May 14th, 2016, at approximately 6:45pm.  The weather outside was blue sky and partly cloudy. I saw a blue orb not far from the plane at our altitude (just above and aft of the right wing) in a mix of clouds and blue sky.  The orb was distinctly circular, small, and stood out because the shade of blue did not match the sky around it.  It definitely had an aura to it. It appeared to be standing still because our plane did not zoom past it.  I had a clear view of it long enough to watch it slowly pass my window, turn to tell my wife, \"Do you see that?\", then turn back and see it go by the passengers window sitting behind me.  It was clearly not a strange reflection in the window because I saw it from the second vantage point through the other passenger's window at a different angle.  The lights in the cabin were also turned off.   It was difficult to determine an approximate distance since I had no reference.  Very strange.",

They were no brighter than the surrounding stars.  They moved from the west going east (75 degrees WNW according to my cell-phone compass). They were directly overhead and appeared to us to be at an altitude of in-flight commercial aircrafts.  They traveled as fast as commercial planes at cruising altitude. There was no sound and they traveled in a straight path.  There was some position changing within the formation.  According to weather.gov, the wind was calm at 18:53 and 5 mph from the SW at 19:53.  Our observation was at 19:10. We did not feel or observe any wind. At first sight, I was alone. I saw 10 white lights (round) in a staggered row from left to right with 5 trailing in a 2-1-2 pattern.  I went to get my wife so she could see/confirm.  This took 15-20 seconds.  Upon our return outside, the staggered row contained 12 white lights and three were trailing in a 2-1 pattern.  They did not appear to blink, but periodically, a few would indiscriminately fade out then back to full glow.  This process took 2-3 seconds.  It was a clear, cloudless night.  The total observation took 2-3 minutes.  The lights were very similar to the lights videoed in Charlotte, NC, on 10/15 and posted to YouTube.    .   .   .   .                                            .    .     .    .   .   . .    .   .   .                                               .   .   .   .   .   . .    .                                                          .        . . .     .                                                             .

Not to be confused with the Nibiru idea.  This does not resemble a second sun, but it looks like a star that just happens to be about 2-3 times larger than even the brightest star visible from here..not as large as the sun, or moon.  It stood out because I stare at the sky everyday into the evening and night and have never noticed it.  Apon watching it, I realized it was moving extraordinarily slow with the help of the trees as a reference.  It was not moving like a plane, or at plane speed, nor did it resemble a plane..or even a satellite.  I watched it for about 25 minutes and then it was just gone..not out of the line of sight, or over the horizon, but simply gone.   The next day it was there again.  And today it was there again.  At first I believed it was simply a star, but then upon research found that several people over the past week, or so have noticed it worldwide.  So far the only reports from the US have been from southern states.  Most reports from Australia and other countries.  There have been photos.  It appears to be more of a circular ripple rather than a 3 dimensional object.  There have also been infrared images of the sun with this thing showing up in them.  I do not believe it is Nibiru.  I'll try to find more on it, but as of now it still seems fairly new.",

We were facing North.  We notice to our right about half a block away some type of flying craft just above tree top level.  It was moving very slowly.  It appeared to be silver in color, cigar shaped and had a row of windows on its side.  It appeared to have lights on inside.   At first I thought that is was a airliner flying very low and I even tried to see any people sitting in the craft.  However, we soon realized that this was not a airliner.  When the light at the intersection turn green, we crossed the intersection and went into the parking lot of a large bargain store.  I parked the car facing east.  We observed the craft continuing to travel across Independence Blvd. at a very slow rate of speed.  We also noticed that everything became real quiet.  We could not hear the traffic nor could we hear our vehicle running although we could hear each other talking.   We were able to get a good look at it as it crossed the highway.  Although it appeared to have lights on inside, we did not see anything or anybody inside the craft.  As the craft reached the center of Independence Blvd., it stopped, hovered for about a minute and then began to travel toward the east over the highway.  Although it was now heading away from us, we never lost sight of the row of lighted windows that were facing us.  We watched the craft until it disappeared heading east.

The sky was perfectly blue but I noticed it had rivers of chemtrails.  They were not clouds.  I counted at least 2 \"planes\" initially spraying the chemtrails.  See photos for how robust the trails were.  The \"planes\" were spraying and then the trail was dissipating and flowing like a river in the sky. After picking up my kids, I parked the car in the parking lot to get a better look at the planes.  This was about 3:12 p.m. The \"plane\" closest to us looked to be right overhead, and looked white or metallic and very bright.  It was spraying a chemtrail and then it ran out of spray and continued flying in a straight line heading back into the blue sky over the school.  I thought it looked more like a TUBE than a plane.  It also was low enough that I would have expected to hear an engine noise, but it was silent. I looked away for just a few moments to get my camera phone from the car.  My 14-year-old daughter, in the meantime, had her phone camera and was snapping shots.  When I looked back up at the sky, the \"plane\" had completely disappeared and was nowhere to be seen in the expanse of the blue sky.  It just vanished. With 3 kids in the car, I started to drive home, and on our way, saw several other \"planes\" in the sky--I counted about 6 of them in the distance, in close proximity to each other, all spraying straight chemtrails.  I pulled over to the side of the road to observe them and pointed them out to the kids.  I asked my daughter to get shots of the many planes, but she was unable to capture the shot with all of the planes, but she did get the chemtrails in criss-cross patterns. With the kids in the car, and very astonished, I decided to drive around the corner block and return to the point where I could view the planes again.  It took us no more than 2 minutes to drive around the block to the same spot.  By then, every single plane had completely vanished, just like the other one.  This was simply not possible. We caught the photos and now see that the vehicle closest to us did not look like a plane, but a SHINY, METALLIC, TUBE WITH OVAL SEGMENTS IN AN ANT-LIKE SHAPE and there seems to be some kind of black tubing wrapped around the side.",

Up in the sky there was an orange glowing dot that seemed to get bigger and bigger.   I asked my wife if it looked like an airplane and she said yes it then took her words back as we continued to drive.  The ball moved westbound and it looked like a faraway ball of fire.   As the light grew bigger we both realized it wasnt a recognizable aircraft.  I asked my wife to record as we attempted to make a U-turn on the boulevard to keep watching and hopefully record it.   As we stopped, the ball suddenly disappeared out of the sky.  We where both skeptical about what we saw as it was not common.",

      "story": "Triangle yellow lights in the night sky. I have a four-year degree and am working on my Masters degree.   I was traveling up I-85 in-between Charlotte and Salisbury, traveling north-east.  As I was driving, I was looking periodically into the sky at the numerous airplanes with their flashing lights.  Almost 6-8 airplanes were flying and moving in all directions across the sky in different directions.   Then as I look up again, I see 2 lights beside each other straight ahead in the sky and at first, I thought they were just stars because they were not moving or flashing, but I could notice they were brighter than any star in the night sky.  As I got closer it seemed to be getting bigger and was not really moving but seemed to be hovering, almost as if it was studying the nearby airport.  It looked to be roughly 5 miles in the sky right in front of the road.   As I moved closer to it in the car, I could see vividly the 2 lights were now 3 in a triangle. They were a yellowish orange light and still at this point, were not flashing like all the other airplanes in the night sky.  As I drove almost directly under it, I could tell it wasn\u2019t moving or moving extremely slowly, as I saw the triangle of yellow-orange lights that looked to be about the size of two airplanes given the distance.   When we passed underneath it I looked back for a second it looked to be getting smaller and moving higher and away at about a 70 degree angle.  I\u2019m not sure what I saw but it was not acting like, nor looked like any of the other half a dozen airplanes in the night sky.   The 3 bright yellowish orange lights seemed to take up more than half of the bottom of the craft.",

      "story": "1st night saw rectangle rimmed with lights, gliding, then next night, along same path, saw 4 orbs, rotating, creating geometric shapes. It was 3/96, during the time that Comet Hyakutake was visible, so I was looking up trying to see the comet, from the parking lot of my apt complex.  It was around the time of the new moon, so stars were prevalent.  What caught my eye was what looked like stars \u201cmoving\u201d.  It was in fact, the outline of a large rectangle, moving across the sky. It had lights around the rim, so what I was seeing, was the moving lights against the stars, rimming what looked like a perfect rectangle.  I followed it gliding in a straight line, not sure what direction it was, until trees blocked it, maybe 30 seconds to a minute.  It was not very high, in the sky, maybe the height of a 20-story building (I grew up in NYC). The next night, feeling freaked out by what I had seen, I had my roommate come outside with me, to \u201csee the comet\u201d, but I needed to face my fear.  It was about 11pm, about an hour or so later than the sighting of the night before.  Along the same stretch of sky, almost the same \u201cpath\u201d as the rectangle, we saw 4 orbs, perfectly round, bright lights, descending slowly from pretty high up, maybe 20 to 30 stories up, higher than the rectangle from previous night.  As they descended, they were forming geometric shapes & rotating.  They\u2019d form a circle, square & an elliptical, all while rotating slowly.  Against logic, I moved under them, watching them form the shapes & rotate.  They descended very low, maybe 15 stories, give or take; I grew up in a 17-story building, it looked like they descended lower than the height of the top floor of that building, directly above my head & still rotating & forming shapes.  Directly beneath them, I could see the space between them, they did no! t look attached at all, but definitely more like 4 entirely separate orbs. After, what I\u2019ve since described as their \u201cshowboating\u201d, because that\u2019s really what it felt like, making geometric shapes, slowly, in the sky over my head, about 3 or 4 minutes, they started to move, almost exactly along the same path as the rectangle the night before, still forming shapes (mostly squares & circles at this point) & still revolving around eachother, but each together gliding along that same path, until out of site, by the same trees, moving a little slower than the rectangle the night before.  They were definitely not as high up as the rectangular object.  But both nights, there was absolutely no sound from either one, complete silence.  They were both low enough, that had they been an aircraft of some kind, we should definitely have heard something. At first my roommate corroborated my sighting completely, there were no other witnesses the first night.  However, we were both quite spooked by what we saw & although she described the same thing I saw, for several months, she eventually started to say it \u201cnever happened\u201d or that it was \u201cexplainable\u201d.  She never did give another explanation though, she just didn\u2019t want to talk about it. We haven\u2019t spoken in many years, I don\u2019t know if she\u2019d be willing to talk about it now.",

We decided to go outside on the front porch of our apartment and have a cig when we saw it. It came out of nowhere, kind of like a light turning on. It was just there, nothing to build it up or anything. It just appeared. I never actually saw a physical alien, the craft just sorta hovered there. I think they might have just been observing or scanning or some other weird alien thing, studying us. It was only there for a few minutes but when i saw it it startled me and my friend greatly. As soon as i saw it the air grew still. There was a great eerie vibe in the air that ran chills down our spines, sorta hard to explain but not a good feeling. The craft looked like it had a metallic aluminum like appearance. It didn't make any noise but there were blinking lights near the bottom. It was only half a football field long and one story tall. Nobo! dy believes my story but i hope that you guys will and that someone else has a similar experience.",
