I first saw it out of the corner of my eye as I was reading a book as it passed over our apartment, and went to another window the check it out. It flew steadily with yellow/orange lights on its rim that circled intermittently like a neon sign. It has two small red lights on one side that didn't blink. There was also a sequence of rectangles on its underside that pulsated out from its center like this: [[[[ ]]]].  It flew steadily over the city and out of sight, at one point passing a plane that seemed to take no notice. But seeing it juxtaposed againt what was obviously an airplane made it seem even stranger looking. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

I caught up to her as she was heading back to the small parking area. before we got there we saw a white jeep cherokee that we assumed was a park service vehicle there about the thing we saw. as we got closer we found the driver door opened and the vehcle running with it's headlights on. there was another couple by thier car and we asked about the jeep and they said someone must've fallen off the bluff or something.  there was nothing in the paper about any accidents and there was never anything reported about that evening.  we have never forgotten that incident and we've never seen anything similiar before or since.

      "story": "Boomerang Shaped Objects w/ dark & light color scheme It was a sunny Sunday afternoon and we (4 of us) were watching football in my friend's 2nd floor apartment in the Richmond Dist.  I spotted two men on the street below looking upwards and pointing.  We all thought they were looking up at one of the windows in the apartment building across the street.  My buddy yelled down to them \"what are you looking at you perverts\".  They looked up and shouted back \"wholly shit....do you see it too?\".   They were both almost hysterical. One of the men had a small eye piece he was looking through.  He tossed it up to us so we could see for ourselves.  There was a boomerang shaped craft way up in the sky.  It remained motionless as white puffy clouds were passing underneath. You could barely see it without the eyepiece. Then one of the guys said \"look, there's more\".  Sure enough we could see 2 then 3....I counted 4 total.  All the same shape hovering close to one another.  They all seemed to have the same segmented color scheme. A dark band followed by a light color band followed by another dark band.  Kind of like a bumble bee.  We all went out onto the street and continued watching the craft. No one had a camera so we began stopping people on the street and pointing out the objects to them. I guess this was an attempt to prove to ourselves we weren't crazy or seeing things.   After a while of watching & telling people, it was weird, there was nothing else we could do.  Eventually we went back up stairs and I continued looking back up in the sky to see if they were still hovering. I looked up the last time and they were gone.  We never saw them zoom off...they just disappeared.  I found this site while surfing the new google video search engine. When I did a search by date and saw a similar sighting on the same day in NY I had to post this.  This was very real!  It was in broad daylight on a clear day and the objects were seen by several people.",

      "story": "Object with bright light above San Francisco accelerated towards my plane at impossible speed for a normal aircraft On Sun Feb 17 2008 I was flying into SFO from Toronto on AC755. The time was about 10-15 minutes before our scheduled landing time of 7:52 PM, which would make it around 7:30-7:45 PM. We were flying over land that was spotted with some bodies of water. I was sitting on a window seat on the left side of the plane so I assume I was looking south. Here is a picture I found on the net that is similar to the view I had:  http://www.factionfive.com/blight/uploaded_images/DSC02804-771617.JPG. I would guess we were about 10,000 feet high, but perhaps someone more knowledgeable can estimate the height given the information above.  I was admiring the view when I noticed a light that was noticeably brighter than the other city lights coming from an object above a small body of water (like a small lake).  The shape appeared to be a sphere but I can't be sure as it was far away.  It was unusual enough to keep my attention. The light was a bright yellowish white but seemed to change to a bluish white and did not blink. It was moving very slowly so at first I thought it could be a helicopter. After observing it for about 30 seconds I felt it was not a helicopter and was definitely not a plane. What happened next is why I think it is worth reporting as a UFO; the object started to accelerate at a geometric rate. It quickly sped up and flew up towards the plane and passed below and in front of us in about 2-3 seconds. If I had to guess, I would say the object was 15,000 feet away when I first saw it over the lake and it came within 2000 feet of the plane when it passed under and front of my view. I may have the absolute distances wrong but the relative distance (2000:15000) is about correct.  The point is the object appeared to accelerate from almost nothing to beyond 1000 mph in about 2 seconds.  It happened so quickly and I was in disbelief by what I saw. I looked around at the other passengers hoping that someone else saw it but no one appeared to have. I recall a red glow on the lower half of the object but I am not confident about this particular detail (this happened over 3 months ago) but the rest I am confident of what I saw. I have never reported a UFO before. I would like to know if anyone else saw this.",

      "story": "San Francisco man, then 22, reported details of 1963 abduction to friend. This is a second party report of a UFO abduction which occurred in about 1963.  The abductee was about 22 years old at the time. He told the story to another person approximately in 1965, who first recounted it to me about two years ago. It is of high interest because the abductee apparently was able to remember the event in extreme detail. He worked as an outside salesman at the time of the abduction event, perhaps the reason he was not noticed as missing by person who knew him. The abductee said he was missing for three days. He described the abductors as being small \"people\" with large heads and large eyes. He considered them to be performing \"medical experiments\" on him. Evidently, he believed the abductors to be able to communicate telepathically, and reported that they conveyed to him that they would be contacting him again every 10 or 15 years. The abductee told the person who reported this story to me that his father owned a drugstore chain in San Francisco. Recently, my source talked to me again about this story, and recalled that he said that his family attended Temple Baptist Church in San Francisco. Evidently, he got married at Temple Baptist Church about in 1966. He was described as being of medium height and slim build, and a Scandanavian ethnic type with blond hair. I am not personally in a position to investigate this story since I do not live in the San Francisco Bay Area anymore or in California at all, but I think a good investigator could make quick work of finding out who this person was. If he is still alive, I imagine he would be willing to talk. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I am not able to determine speed - I did not hear any unusual noise - no was there any trace of a trail - there were no lights or beams coming from it either - and there were no other aircraft around it.

It stayed the same intensity of red the entire sighting until a jet plane flew near it at which point it blinked completely out.  A second later it reappeared but at a much less intensity of brightness.  It blinked completely out again then reappeared a second time even less intensely for an instant then blinked out again and never reappeared.

Then the two bright objects began taking their own path, seeming to moving in a wave like motion, I yelled to my partner to look at them, then they moved into the light fog, which made them more noticeable due to the shimmer of round bright light reflecting in the fog. Then, they began to pick up speed, each taking two different paths, the front object rose in altitude rapidly and shot out toward Golden Gate Bridge and disappeared. The second object remained visible for about 3 additional seconds as it appeared to fly away at a lower altitude in more west then the prior. The weird thing was that the round pulsing light object seemed to get brighter in size as it speed off and dissipated into the fog.  These were no traditional aircraft. Secondly, they were not spot lights from the surface to the sky, they were fast moving, silent and erratic flying craft. They did not make normal flight patterns or aerial movements.",

We were at San Quentin village on the little beach. I looked up into perfectly clear blue sky and happened to see 3, very small points of brilliant white light. The lower 2 seemed to be one over the other and the top light was equidistant from the other 2, but to the left, about 15 degrees. The 3 lights were \"joined\" by 2 very thin, black lines. I asked my brother if he saw anything up in the sky, without showing him and he described what I saw. I then went over to my 21 y/o niece, and without describing to her what I saw, asked her. She described the same  lights. The 3 lights were due south of San Quentin Prison, and possibly directly high over San Francisco. It wasn't possible to estimate the distance - but they were, as best I could tell (I triangulated with a tree branch) motionless over the city (or at least in that direction). There was an air show down in South Bay that day and 2 military jets did do a low pass over us before we saw the 3 lights. We saw the 3 lights for 30 to 45 minutes and then as my brother and I were watching, they \"seemed\" to flit up and disappear. They left no vapor trails Their light was almost lazer-like, dazzling and just a pinpoint with some slight \"flaring\". I am also a pilot and can state that it wasn't a satellite, a plane, a balloon or blimp. About a year later, I ran into my sister-in-law's brother - and - he recounted that he, from the South Bay, was working on his house on the weekend and also had seen a series of, what he proceeded to describe, as the same type of lights and about the same time of the year. He described them as \"over San Francisco\". So, if they were the same lights, We both, from different locations, saw them over San Francisco. He is a pilot, also.",

The lights were of equal brightness. They were not as bright as the lights of an airplane and were approximately the color and brightness of bright stars. If I remember correctly, they were white with a slightly blue tint. The lights traveled over the city from slightly north of my position to directly west of my position. At its closest, the triangle appeared to be twice the size of a full moon.  It took approximately seven seconds for the triangle to travel into the distance when I lost sight of it near the tops of the houses on the west side of the avenue. (I was standing on the sidewalk of the east side of the avenue.) The triangle appeared to tilt slightly as it traveled into the distance. There were two airplanes in the area at the time. One was to the southwest and one was to the northwest. Their lights were considerably brighter and one airplane was loud. They crossed the sky at a much slower pace and with noise. After I lost sight of the unusual lights, I wondered if they had slightly changed formation near the end of my sighting or if the appearance of such a change was the result of the change in my perspective.",

      "story": "solid, white object seen over S. F. Bay in high atmosphere, momentarily stationary On Sunday June 8, 2008 my friend and I had just gotten out of a local museum, and were lying in the grass in Union Square (downtown San Francisco) from about 4-5:15 pm soaking up some sun. As we were lying there chatting, I noticed what I first thought were balloons (or a balloon) directly up into the sky close to the position of the moon.  After watching it for about five minutes wondering what it was, I determined that it wasn\u2019t moving around like balloons might on a windy day at high altitude (it\u2019s been fairly windy in S.F. these past few weeks), and it was also too close to be a star or planet.   I finally pointed it out to my friend, and he also suggested it was a balloon.  As we continued chatting, the object slowly began to pick up slight velocity drifting towards the horizon (towards the south), away from the position of the moon.  After about 10 minutes of drifting, the object appeared to look like a hyphen (it looked like a ball before), and I pointed this out to my friend.  Eventually we lost track of the object, and kept on with our conversation.  A few minutes later, I again looked back up towards the moon, and the object (or another object) reappeared to the location where we saw the first object.  I again pointed it out to my friend, and we both thought it was odd that earlier it had slowly drifted towards the south, and was now instantly right back where it started.  We left shortly after, not thinking too much about the whole thing.  The reason why I am posting this is because this morning on the news there was a short segment on an object that was observed (by whom I don\u2019t know) Sunday afternoon over San Francisco Bay, and the news clip featured a video of the same object that we had seen.  The segment didn\u2019t say much about what the object was, just that the F.A.A. had taken notice.  I am assuming many people had seen it if it had been featured on the Monday morning news, and was described on the news to have moved from above one city to another.  From my own observations, I can describe the object as white (non-metallic), not emitting light, larger than the size of Jupiter or Venus in the night sky, and fairly circular (upon our first observation).  The object appeared stationary at first (the object did NOT get smaller as a balloon would upon rising), but later drifted across the sky (faster than planets and stars appear to move at night, but much slower than man-made satellites move).  The object did not appear to change change size as it moved away, but did appear to look more liner as it drifted away.  It was definitely not an airplane (it was close enough so that we could resolve its outlines and determine a circular shape from our perspective), and looked very solid.  The whole experience did not seem very normal, and I am greatly wondering how many other people saw it, and what it may have been.",

I was lying in my bed on Sunday night (early Monday morning) around 2:07 a.m. when I turned my head around to look out the window (my bed is facing away from the window, but is right next to it), I started to notice that I could see some of the major stars that night which was rare. Because it is usually always cloudy here at State, but the last couple of days have been pretty clear sky and ok visibility at night which allowed me to only see the very bright stars in the sky... After looking for about a minute I saw these two lights in the distance that looked like planes at first, but became much similar in size and appearance as the stars around them. But these two objects were coming straight towards my direction (still very far away and high altitude). After flying side by side they satrted to cross paths simultaneously in kind of a figure-8 type motion. while moving very quickly, and traveling very fast.. they stopped in mid-air for about 2 seconds.. At this point, I thought it was just my eyes and maybe I had been sitting for too long. but I adjusted my eyesight, even moved closer and away from the window. I know what I saw.. It was so amazing.. Then the two lights faded into a purple-pinkish color and started moving and crossing paths again in a way that defined the laws of gravity. They would squiggle for a second, then they casually coasted through the clouds and started whisking away parallel with my window (still far away)..and as they flew away they would travel while continuously fly over eachother and then cross paths like they were joy-riding or something. it sounds weird, but it was quite beautiful, it was almost like they were dancing at one point, i was so excited and amazed by it. I followed them with my eyes as they zipped very quickly away into the clouds. There is no way this could have been any commercial or military aircraft because of its color, comlexity, speed, and it's very odd way of manuevering.. I had never ! seen a U FO in my life until now. I don't do drugs and I wasn't drunk. I just had to get my story out. I wanted to know if anyone else saw something similar to this in the San Fransisco Area on September 18 around 2:00 AM....",

The trees block your view of the bridge and water every now and then, but when the tree line opened up I took full advantage of my chance to get a nice view of the bridge and the bay while still riding.   At that moment I looked to my left to view the bridge and the surrounding hills across the bay, I then saw an object that is hard to explain.

It was a blimp shape with a slight edge on each side forming kind of a saucer, but it was more blimp like in shape, definitely shiny metal.

      "story": "black triangles were seen flying across the surface of the full moon I was looking at the full moon through my telescope (Mead-Model 70AZ-AR)when I saw a small black triangle fly from left to right horizontally across the face of the moon.  It lasted about two seconds and once the triangle passed the lighted moon surface, I couldn't see it anymore. It looked, from what I could see, to be just a dark black surface- no lights on the object but with clear lines defining its triangle shape against the lighted surface of the moon.  About 5 minutes later another black triangle moved over the moon's surface from bottom to top.  This second black triangle moved much quicker, about a second or less, with the same black surface and clear lines.  Approximately 3 minutes later, another black object moved diagonally across the upper left hand side of moon's surface from left to right, very quickly, faster than the first two objects.  The third object was moving so fast that it looked to be more like a sphere, but with the same deep black color.  It was the color that I could clearly see against the moons surface.  All three objects had clear lines against the backdrop of the moon and dissapeared once they had passed the moons surface.  The first two objects had a clear delineated shape of a triangle against the moon's surface.  The third object was more of a definate color, a deep black against the moon, but not having as clear of a shape as the first two, due to its' was moving so fast.  The first two objects were the same size, the third looked a little smaller. I am currently a graduate student in psychology.  I couldn't sleep that night-but I was awake and lucid. I had been up around that time for the past three days writing papers.  I had gotten used to being up and awake around that time, so I wasn't surprised that I was awake.  It takes me a couple of days to get back to sleeping normally after I finish a big project.  Since I was up, I decided to take out my telescope and enjoy the full moon.  I had been looking at the moon, trying different lenses, trying to find different landmarks for about 10 minutes or so when I saw the first black triangle.",

      "story": "At roughly 10:10pm, on Tuesday, October 17, 2006, I went outside to have a cigarette. The observations that follow took place while I was standing approximately 30 feet above the ground, on the back staircase of my apartment in San Francisco, California.  Almost immediately after walking onto the staircase, I noticed what quickly revealed itself to be a large bird, probably a bird of prey, flying from the Northwest to the Southeast, perhaps 100 feet above me. It was an unusual sight; as far as I know, birds are diurnal creatures. I could see the bird clearly and made a mental note that this was probably a result of the city lights reflecting. I watched it pass above my head.  Just as the bird had passed directly above me when I was distracted by something in the sky traveling in almost precisely the opposite trajectory as the bird. My most immediate thought was that I was looking at an airplane. The object passed directly over the bird I\u2019d been watching, traveling in what looked to be exactly the opposite path.  It\u2019s difficult to reconstruct the order of my impressions of the object. I will do my best.  My first unusual impression was that I couldn\u2019t identify the sound.  At the time I thought little of it, but in the way that one tries to identify the sound of an aircraft (\"Is it a plane?\" vs. \"Is it a helicopter?\")  I came up empty. The sound was a mechanical, aeronautical sound that (I am trying not to characterize this retrospectively) that was close to that one would expect from a jet airplace than that of a helicopter, but was not the sound of an airplance nevertheless. It was an industrial, aeronautical sound that I could not decisively identify.  I had what I must in fairness describe as a mild sense of confusion driven by the fact that in addition to my inability to precisely identify the sound I was hearing, there was something not familiar about the color and intensity of the lights themselves. Given the volume of the sound (Again, I am describing as best I can thoughts and impressions that occurred in fractions of a second in real time) I had the impression that the aircraft was higher than the bird I\u2019d been watching but low enough to make a strong sound--less than 3000 feet for sure. The lights seemed duller (less bright?) than they should have given the other variables. They were a dark red, or a blurry red--it was like a dulled orangeish red.  I have made dozens of attempts since the event to draw the distribution of the lights I saw on the object. The best description I can come up with: The representation of 5 on a standard die, with an additional light in between the two rightmost dots. ((NUFORC Note:  The formation did not survive the transfer from e-mail to our database.  PD))  \u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022     This pattern of lights moved from Southeast to Northwest for roughly 4 seconds. The part of the experience that was truly extraordinary came after the 4 seconds. As I watched with mild interest, the following happened; what I would call the lead light (the light farthest to the side of the direction in which the object was moving) reversed its postion. It took less than 1 second to do so; in that time, the lead light traveled clockwise until it occupied exactly the oppose position it had before. The object now looked like this:  \u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022   Then, in a fraction of a second and from my point of view, the object seemed to tilt in such a way that the western or leading edge went upward and the eastern or trailing edge downward. I say this not because it was directly visible as such, but because that was impression in the moment: the leading two lights disappeared from view, but I could still see the rear 4.  Almost immediately thereafter (much less than 1 second), the entire object vanishedfrom view. Watching, I did not have the impression of something speeding away. It seemed simply to vanish.  That is what I saw tonight. I have never seen anything remotely like it, and I have never before had a disposition one way or another vis a vis UFOs.  Please let me know if you can explain this event. ((name deleted)) San Francisco, Calif. (808) 232-((number deleted))",

It didn't appear to be a solid object (like the point of a plane) but was rather like a collection of dim orange lights. It made no noise. It is very difficult to describe its size or how high in the sky it was but it seems like it was as high as the stars and was, very roughly, about the size of 2 Orion's belts in a V shape.

And I turned to my boyfriend and pointed it out to him.  Him being so skeptical, I thought he was going to dismiss what I was seeing, but he looked up and said, \"what is that?\".  We both agreed it was not a plane or like anything we have ever seen before.   I am pretty positive it wasnt a plane because planes have red or white lights flashing and are always flying over head as we live near 2 major aiports; and seeing so many, this was in no way a plane.  The light was very bright, large and orange in color, wierd in shape (fireball-ish?), like nothing I've seen before. As we stared we noticed that the orange light was very bright and large for being a distance away. It was heading Northwest to Southeast, towards us. The first one stopped, stood still or hovered for more than a few seconds and then headed west. There was a second one behind it, just as bright orange as the first. It was coming from the same direction. It stopped and was hovering. It pulsed as did the first one when it was hovering, almost to the point of dissapperance. It did a small square flight pattern(looked very unatural), and headed west(was out of site pretty quickly once heading west-within 3-4 seconds). The duration was about 2 min and there was absolutely no sound whatsoever associated w/ the objects. My boyfriend is very skeptical, but he said it was like nothing he has ever seen before. The color was just such a bright rich orange color and the flight pattern was very akward. I have no idea what it was, I just know it was a first that I have seen something like this.",

I was standing at my living room window in the Sunset District of San Francisco watching the sunset over the ocean when I saw them.  As they approached I questioned if in fact they were planes. They were absolutely quite.  It seemed one was following the other.  They moved in a straight line almost directly toward me.  One got close enough that I could see four lights, one red, one yellow and 2 white lights.  The lights were pulsating.  Then I moved to my bedroom window trying to get a better view.  They were both still there after I transitioned rooms.  My bedroom window also has an ocean view looking west but is more south than my living room window. Then it seemed they were out of view so I went to my back decks on the east side of my building and saw them again.  They were still heading southeast and seemed to be heading toward a third object that looked like a star.  At the closest the larger one seemed the size of an eraser on a pencil. Then a fourth one came from the southwest and seemed to be heading north not following the others.  That one was quite big also, in that it was just over the rooftops and could not have been a star in that case. It also had 4 pulsating lights red, yellow and 2 white lights. It seemed a bit closer than the other two that seemed to pass overhead of the building I was in. All in all it felt like I watched for a good 10 to 15 minutes.  There was no sound at all and no trails of any sort.  I was not able to see any of them by the time the sun set. What did I see?  Today is 6/14/09.  It is now 10:14pm.  This sighting occurred as the sun set. It was quite a beautiful sunset in a clear sky after a warm clear day.",

My second thought was that it was a missile, because it moved like a missile, like it was up so high and was far enough away to appear to be moving very slowly, but it was moving towards the beach. I watched it from 7:30 to 8:08 pm, when the fog rolled in, and it disappeared. Several other people on the beach also witnessed it and took pictures with their cell phones.",

I was outside around 6:30-7:00pm on Friday after work playing with my dog, and b/c I live 5 minutes from the airport I happened to be looking up at all the airplanes in the sky. I noted just before the incident about what a clear night it was and how you could see almost all the stars. As I watched one plane that happened to be pretty low probably having just taken off and banking in a southern direction; going just under my clear view of a very bright Venus; I looked down at my dog. When I looked back up to find the plane to see which direction it was heading in, I noticed a single white light moving from the south to the north. It struck me as odd b/c I could see about 7 planes in the sky at one time from my vantage point and I noticed that all the planes in the sky had at a minimum of 2-4 lights on, and at least 1-2 flashing lights. I watched the single white light move north at a somewhat medium pace, wasn't fast, wasn't slow. As it got closer the single light started to turn pink, then changed to red then completely faded out. After I saw that I assumed that the object, presumably a plane, probably banked to the side and the light was hidden by a wing. So I sat outside for 10 minutes and watched the sky in the general area where the object was heading. I never saw a light appear in the area. I still saw several planes in the area, all with multiple light, and flashing lights. I also remembered to recheck the sky conditions for possible clouds... not a single cloud in the sky. I'm a natural born skeptic, so this is strange for me. I was so baffled by this, that I told my wife and of course she laughed and told me I was crazy.",

ABOUT ME: I am a retired electronics Eng, 59 and working part time. I also have a FAA Private Pilot License and I am a backyard amateur A. I own a 12-inch reflector and a 6-inch refractor. On this night we were experiencing a warm front over the S.F. Bay Area. 20 degrees above normal for this time of year. The moon was \u00be full and just visible over the eastern horizon. Because of the moon lit sky (the suns light reflecting off the moon of course), birds were easily seen flying overhead at higher altitudes. THE SIGHTING: I was sitting on a backyard recliner drinking ice water using a  8 x 40 quality binocular to star qaize. My eyes were night adapted and just a few seconds before seeing the UFO, I was looking at the constellation Pegasus, I drifted my binoculars upward to look at a nebula when I saw what looked like a large black bird or object flying where my binocular was pointing. I thought how strange the shape as it did not have a bird shape. I continued to look into the binocular and followed this dark object heading 180 degrees south in a straight line. It was almost overhead, maybe within a \u00bd mile east of my home. It was flying with NO LIGHTS and NO SOUND. I live with 15 miles of SFO airport and see many planes turning and overhead for final approach with the red left wing light flashing and the green right wing lit. But this craft had no lights at all, made no sound. It was low enough be heard, but no sound was heard! If it was the size of a 747 jet, then I would say it would have been about 1000 to 1200 feet above SL. What was more unusual to me was its belly. It had 3 round disks shapes connected to it. So in conclusion, It had a TRANGULAR SHAPE, was DARK GRAY (lit by the moon light) with 3 ROUND CIRCLES ON ITS BOTTOM. No airplane wings or rudder or ailerons were seen. It seem to be running in a stealth mode maybe because of its low alitude, but the moon gave it away. I was lucky enough to have my binocular in that direction otherwise I would have never seen it with the eye alone. I followed it for about 7 seconds until my shed blocked further viewing. I ran up to tell my wife and boy but they did not believe me at first but the next day they seemed more convinced by my going on and on about seeing it. PAST SIGHTING: My first was in 1967 over the Pacific Ocean standing on the San Francisco beach and it was at night. I never reported it as I did not think anyone would believe be. But, I did tell friends and family. If you want information on that sighting I would be glad to tell you? I am interested if others had seen it.",

She pointed it out to me - I was standing about 15 feet south of her - and I looked up and saw 3 dim points of light (about the brightness of a dim star) that formed an equilateral triangle, moving quickly in smooth, straight line north/northeast.  At first we thought this might be a plane but considering that the craft appeared to be silent, and that the lights were a decent distance from one another it does not match the description of any plane that either of us has ever seen.  the craft moved smoothly out of sight and we ran uphill to try and continue observing it but were unable to.  For what it is worth, I grew up in a town that was home to a Navy Air Station and was within the flight path for a major international airport and did not recognize the lights we saw as being consistent with any plane or helicopter that I've ever seen.",

      "story": "Small white dot flying through sky in San Francisco A friend and I were at Dolores Park in San Francisco yesterday.  The incident occurred somewhere between 5:15 pm and 5:25 pm.  It was a sunny day with a bright blue sky. It was cloudless. We were laying on our backs looking up at the sky.  I noticed a pigeon sitting on top of a lamp post that was in the park.  I noticed a small white object floating down to the earth.  I thought the object was a feather that had fallen from the bird.  For some reason, I was fixated on it and watched it float to the ground. I told my friend to look at the feather and pointed out that it was taking a really long time to hit the ground.  All of a sudden (and I know this sounds strange,) the \"feather\" went up higher in the air instead of coming down.   At first I thought a gust of wind blew it higher. Then, all of a sudden it appeared to shoot through the sky up and over to the right above some houses.  The way it was traveling did not seem plausible by Science.  It shot FAST across the sky as if the sky was sucking it in.  Like it was traveling through another dimension. I don't know if it was actually a feather that we noticed which drew our attention to the small white object or if the feather transformed into the white object.  But it flew SO fast and high and eventually disappeared.  As it got further away it looked less and less like a feather and more like a tiny white dot that was glowing. Like a shooting start that went up instead of down.  I hope this made sense. I looked around to see if anyone else in the park was noticing it but no one was.  My friend that was with me saw the exact same thing.  I had him describe to me in detail what he witnessed to make sure I wasn't seeing things.  He described it accurately.",

All of a sudden i saw an extremely bright light in the sky ahead of me all of a sudden shooting down diagonally extremely fast. to me it seemed like it was a white dot of light that all of a sudden popped out of the sky and immediately shot down towards the ground. i could not see where excatly it landed or anything because it shot down and went behind this hill hill in the distance. When i first saw it my first insticnt was that it was like maybe  firework but i quickly realized that it could not be because fireworks go up, then i thought maybe it was some sort of missle but i dont think that i would not have seem something as bright as that coming from higher up in the sky because i just saw it pop out of nowhere. then i started to think. after around 30 seconds i said \"wait hold on.. did u guys see that???\" and immediatelly my girlfriend said \"yeah, what was it?\" then i said \"i dont know what did you see\"  and according to her she saw a bright white line coming from the sky diagonally but she says she only saw it with her perifiral vision. i assume that it was a bright dot that was moving so fast that it seemed like a line coming down diaginally in a perfecly straight line. i knew that it could not be lightning because when i got out of the car i looked up at the sky and saw that it was a very clear night without a cloud in sight. also it could not have been lightning becuase it was way to bright. and also lightning comes down straight to the ground  but this came down diagonally  and in a straight line. I know that it was not a shooting star either becuase i have seen many and this was way brighter and bigger than a star and faster. after that we were all pretty s! cared an d confused.

I guess my peripheral vision detected a slight movement so I continued to look at the 2 stars.  Soon I realized that the right light was actually moving east very slowly.  Its light was a distinct muted red, definitely a different red from Mars.  If I were to measure the distance of travel at arm\u2019s length it moved about 8-9 inches in the night sky.  It moved to the east for about 2 minutes and then stopped, soon after it just stayed in one position and after 30 seconds or so it began to slowly and steadily fade away until it was completely gone as if it were leaving Earth\u2019s atmosphere.  It took about a minute to completely vanish. I know what it wasn\u2019t.  It was not a satellite, airplane, jet, helicopter, weather balloon, Chinese floating lantern or anything else that I have seen before.  I do not know what it was.

I was curious and continued to watch it, and then noticed there was an identical object a short distance behind it.  They moved at a moderate pace in a straight line and did not waver, which confirmed they were not birds.  Then the second object started moving underneath the first one, but stayed the same distance apart and neither changed speed.  It continued rotating around the first object until it was in front.  Then they passed behind a building and from my sight.  It is possible they were satellites, but I have never seen two satellites near each other like that, never during the day, and they also moved slower than other satellites I have seen  Recently someone in the bay area saw something similar: http://www.ktvu.com/news/16548130/detail.html.

The object was observed against a ship light for reference to make sure the object was moving; also the star before the big dipper juts-up the star which is not part of the big dipper in the handle was also used for reference.

One note at no time did the object move north of the last star in the handle of the big dipper as if it was a boundary.

I live 10 miles from the San Francisco International Airport and jets pass over head at 1500 to 3000 feet.  This was no jet. It made no noise, no sound and had three bright study lights turned on at the crafts rear section.  They were rectangular in shape. No other lights were visible.  It was an incredible sight, so close.  I have it on video.",

This Thanksgiving night 2010, I captured on videotape (from my back yard in San Francisco, CA.) a Chevron shaped UFO. It was heading True North and was seen East of my home about 60 degrees up. It looked like a ghost ship because it was a semi-transparent white color but it did have a detailed shape. I do not know the size or altitude of this UFO. If it did make a noise, I did not hear it because I think it was too far away. I also saw and videotaped 2 other different UFO shapes on this night. A seperate file will be sent on these UFOs.",

The UFOS were near the San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park area about 2000 to 3000 feet high. Without knowing their size, it would be difficult to judge the actual altitude. My home is under the SF bay approach for jets landing at the SF International Airport. I heard no sound from the UFOs and that is strange because it looked like they were moving much faster than the speed of sound and there was no sonic boom.

Noticed about 3 or 4 spheres, glowing orange, over Ocean Beach.   First thought it was fireworks (a lot of people set them off at this beach), then thought it may have been fishing boats but the orange spheres rose up slightly and hovered for several seconds (felt like minutes) very un-boat-like.  Saw 2 or 3 more orange light spheres rise up in the air.    Third thought was weather balloons, or maybe glowing kites, but then the spheres rose up higher, some faster than the others, all moving up but not in a uniform direction.   The spheres then moved south towards Pacifica and disappeared.  Never seen anything like this and couldn\u2019t find any reference online \"mysterious lights\"; lights over Ocean Beach\" etc, to what I saw.  Finally found these postings and am so glad someone else saw this too.  Overall sighting lasted maybe three or four minutes- a long time. The other post mentions being over by 24th St which is high on a hill but far from Golden Gate Park/Ocean Beach.  They saw three but I think it was due to the distance; I was much closer and the lights were closer to the ground, also lots of tall houses/buildings in that area. No particular background for me, other than I believe in UFOs and that we aren't alone in this universe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I looked hard for a remnant of a faint light but there was nothing. I thought maybe behind a cloud but then realized I could see many and vast stars all in the area it vanished in - so this would rule out cloud cover. Very odd sighting. In summary; it seemed to be fairly low in the sky moving generally toward me. One glowing cherry-red center and an orange-yellow halo which diminished over time to vanish all together, and then the red center grew faint quickly and it vanished from all sight completely; seemingly moving in an upward flight into the atmosphere. No trace of any light could be seen, I could see stars. But nothing at all.",

I was in the middle of the city, walking east, when I glanced north and saw the objects moving from the northwest (seemingly coming from over the Pacific Ocean), and moving to the east (or slightly southeast).  I could not see their full passage through the sky, as part of it was blocked by neighborhood buildings (they were not extremely far above the horizon, and my view of them could be obstructed by three-story building across the street from where I was). The objects were not making any sound that was audible from where I was walking. Relative to a star or planet in the night sky, the objects were about the same size or slightly bigger than the planet Jupiter.  They twinkled slightly, as stars do, and did not emit a pattern of blinks.  The air was steady (no wind) and the sky was clear. As the objects moved inland, they gradually faded into the distance until no longer visible.  They moved at about the speed of a commercial jet through the sky, if not slightly faster.  They did not leave trails, and were distinct objects, moving from left to right, rather than vertically or at an angle, as shooting stars or space debris passing through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. I did not notice a distinct formation in which they were moving, except that they were all moving in the same direction and disappeared in approximately the same area.  They were not traveling in a line, but were rather staggered in elevation, and moving at the same pace. I pointed the last one I saw out to someone else who was outdoors at the time. I went out twice later in the evening, and did not see similar objects again.

It looked as one orange craft was heading right in my direction, while all orange lights faded out of view.  This lasted under 2 minutes.  As I was watching the sky, I saw 2 military officers in full uniform heading in the direction of Slim's night club on 11th.",

The object looked familiar from an instance on a Sunday in January on either the first or the eighth. Once I spotted the object, I ran and grabbed my camera and recorded a 3min 10sec clip of the light. The light floated gently in the sky varying in brightness and direction in a slow but consistent rate of speed. Stopping in one place for only a few times and a short period of time. The flight path appeared to waver slightly left and right from my view point. Not resembling what I have seen from planes or helicopters flying over the same location. In appearance, the light resembled closest what I would consider a fireball. Reddish to orange around a dark core; though at times the core appeared to flicker with a reddish to yellow hue. I have a BS in Business and Technology and am currently earning my Masters of Architecture degree in San Francisco, Ca. I was the only witness present unfortunately but was able to grab a camera and record the sighting. I believe this sighting tonight is related to the sighting in January due to the similar flight patterns, color and scale of the objects in question. The full moon might also be a similarity as there was one around Sunday January 8th when the first sighting occurred and another on April 6th. Overall, it was quite impressive.",

      "story": "Soccer Balls over SF I do not recall the date or even exact time of the year but likely it was Autumn of 1997 or 1998 in San Francisco, California.  At approximately 10 AM I was standing in the redevelopment zone now known as Mission Bay, adjacent to the old Bethlehem Steel Yard just 60 yds north of the restaurant/lounge called Mission Rock Resort.  I was drinking coffee and watching the view across the Bay to the east when I saw two white \"balls\" just feet off of the deck of SF Bay coming towards me from the direction of the Oakland Airport.  I took these to be two Sikorsky S61 helicopters of the USCG and thought that I was about to witness a test exercise.  However as they came closer into view I realized that these objects had no wings or rotors.   They were soon in good view and the day being near perfectly clear, warm and quiet in my location I could see that they would pass me at near ground level.  As they approached at an estimated 30 mph I could plainly see that they were two separate objects of equal size in the shape of soccer balls, that is they were generally round but had a series of flat sides precisely like that of a soccer ball.  As they neared the edge of the shore they, in perfect close formation, began to climb slightly to an altitude that I estimate as 250-300 ft and passed me only about the same distance laterally.  I was simply awestruck.  I witnessed two fisherman on a nearby dock who apparently saw nothing.   As the two objects passed my location (They made no sound, had no aura, lights or haze around them) they increased their altitude dramatically and climbed to an estimated 1000-1500 feet above the skyline of San Francisco.  It was a weekend day, I believe Sunday and when I followed their progress to the north of me I noticed LARGE numbers of similar objects!   I am familiar with the San Francisco skyline and habits of its citizens and could not identify all of these objects.  A few could have been Mylar party balloons that had gotten away from people and some others were definitely real hot-air balloons in the distance up in Sonoma.  I always kept one eye on these two items while making these other observations.   Upon reaching their maximum altitude the two \"craft\" then did a maneuver about each other that I can only describe as a dance, similar to a deux-se-deux of a square dancer.  This was only momentary and then they began, still in formation, to return along the same flight path that they had just traversed.   Since my first sighting of these two vessels perhaps only three minutes had passed.  I knew that they would return my way yet I found it impossible to yell out to the only two others nearby, the fishermen, as I was so transfixed.  I did notice a police squad car approaching at slow speed and briefly thought to hail them down but my astonishment was such that I could not speak a word!  As expected these two objects returned at the same speed, passed me again at the same distance and again dropped down to the deck as they headed back towards the East Bay.  I had no reference to judge their size and can only surmise that they were each about the size of two small autos.  They were Flat (Mat) Hospital White in color and their surface, clearly solid, could have been metal or even fine wood.  There were no windows, lights or protuberances of any kind.  There were no flames, emissions, contrails or noise. As for the great many other objects that I saw over the City skyline that day, some of which I identified as hot air balloons farther away in the distance and others possible Mylar balloons, there were perhaps 100 more objects, most of them shiny metallic.  Most were stationary or nearly so, some actually moved in the opposite direction of the prevailing wind (Which was negligible that day).  I could clearly see that these shiny metallic ones were rotating on their axis in a clockwise direction.  Most made little lateral movement or altitude adjustments.  As I was focused on the two \"soccer balls\" I dismissed these others, though I found them quite dramatic. I spent the rest of the weekend awed by this experience and upon returning to work at the SF Public Library on Monday I immediately discovered a flier in the lobby alerting people to the \"continuing\" UFO sightings on, around and about the Oakland Bay Bridge in the vicinity of it's Eastern terminus, an area now called South Beach. The flier stated that a CHP unit had observed it one night ( I think I have since read that somewhere else.) and that crowds were continuing to gather. The flier was an open invitation to join the crowd, however I did not. The flier further stated that the local media were aware of the ongoing phenomena but would not cover the story. As I have become so deadened to the UFO issue I did not think to report this to anyone. I promised Peter D. that I would write up this report regardless of it's age.  I lived in San Francisco for over twenty years and spent a great deal of time outside. Indeed I drove a taxi full time for about ten years, 50-60 hours per week.  I am quite aware of the comings and goings of aircraft, flying debris, the relative wind, human activity and so forth in the City.  Nothing that I can imagine can explain away the vast number of odd-acting objects that I observed that day other than the two or three that I noted above.

Other sighting occurred near Ocotillo Wells, California, on, or about May 01st, 1994.  PD))",

It revolved horizontally and I was able to see that it was egg or cigar shaped because it would be a small dot and then it would be long and skinny.  When it was long, it was about 3 times the length of when it was a dot.  There was a glare on top of it from the sun. I looked at the UFO more closely with binoculars and it had a black underside and maroon/redish topside. It also appeared to have fins like a fish.  The fins were translucent green and in the same locations as a fish.  A fin on top, a fin on bottom, and a larger \"tail\" fin.

Location: San Francisco, CA  Date: October 2nd, 2013     UFO sighting report  On October 2nd, 201,3 at about 11:45 am, on a cloudless sunny Wednesday morning in San Francisco, I witnessed a round shaped (it could\u2019ve been disc shaped) UFO flying at a very high altitude going from northwest to southeast direction.  The object was white but it could\u2019ve been silver, it was very high in the sky, way higher than altitudes that regular passenger jets usually fly in this area.  It was flying at a slow speed from my perspective and it was not doing any erratic movements.  At one particular point, it sharply turned east positioning itself right above my head and then it stopped moving and just hovered there for a while, which clearly indicated that this thing was under intelligent control. The object stayed semi-stationary, doing side to side and up & down small movements (again from my perspective), and at one point I felt that the object intentionally wanted me to see it...  After about 10 minutes, the object started moving and after another minute or so I lost eye contact with it as it moved away to the southeast, it was very very high up in the sky.  The best part of this sighting was that I was able to capture a 1:36 s video of the object while it was above my head executing side to side up & down small maneuvers.  The white/silver object although small is pretty clear in the video if you know what you\u2019re looking for.  I was filming it with my iphone camera which does not have a zoom feature (which sucks).  I was tempted to go grab my digital camera which has good zoom but I was afraid I was going to lose contact  with the object if I ran inside the house to retrieved the digital cam (which the batteries turned out to be dead I found out later, so it was the right decision). The convincing part of this sighting is that there were absolutely no clouds whatsoever in the clear skies that day and you can clearly see the round shaped object in the video.  Another interesting side of this experience was that, a few minutes before, I was contemplating the sky in a meditative state of mind sending out thoughts of harmony, joy, love and eagerness for knowledge, I made a request that if there were anybody out there intercepting my thoughts at that moment to please manifest itself somehow, then this object appeared out of nowhere flying from the northwest.  It almost looked like it turned off its cloak device to show itself to me. I was amazed, undoubtedly this sighting was real, it wasn\u2019t an airplane (they don\u2019t stop in mid-air), it wasn\u2019t a weather balloon, and it wasn\u2019t an optical illusion either.  This was a metalic/whitish colored structured flying pretty high in the sky under intelligent control.",

The plane could be heard, but was slightly behind the glowing object which had passed first and silently.   It was very large and I suppose it could have been the international Space Station if it was passing over San Francisco at that time, otherwise I cannot image what it could have been.

It was brightly flashing white, blue and red lights so maybe the police.  Even that would be a first because I've never seen a police helicopter at night in the area of SF I live in.  But then after watching it for literally a second or two the lights just vanish.  I wait and nothing.  Looked at where it is suppose to be based on how fast it was moving but I didnt see it again. I know how planes would usually have flashing lights too but I have  never seen any simply disappear.  It's a fairly cloudy night and I would've seen the intensity of the lights diminish if it went further away or behind clouds.  My skin was covered in goosebumps when it was simply gone.

I happened to be looking out my front window which is a south eastern exposure and saw a blinking series of lights on what appeared to be an elongated craft which seemed to be rod or cylinder shaped.  It traveled about the same speed as you'd observe a fighter jet or shooting star passing through the atmosphere - extremely fast.  What made me consider the very high altitude of the object in the atmosphere was the fact that the lights faded out far above the horizon, as a shooting star would.  It was only visible for what seemed to be a fraction of a second, however long it takes to witness a solid shooting star.   I was stunned!  There was no sound.

Duration of sighting: less than 10 seconds Angle of elevation of sighting: approx. 20 degrees  I was walking westbound on 17th Street in San Francisco, CA approaching the intersection of Castro Street & 17th Street.  I looked up at the large, 300 meter high- communications tower (Sutro Tower) on the hilltop approx. 1.5 miles away from my viewing position and noticed slightly to the north of the tower two spheres. The spheres appeared to be light matte gray in color.  They were both the same size.  No lights, no glowing, no reflection, no shininess.  They did appear to be spinning rapidly, one above the other, very close together.  I would estimate their size to be approx. 25 feet.  The spheres changed position, revolving quickly around the other one to switch position.  The spheres then pulled away from each other (right-to-left) and then quickly moved back together and merged abruptly into one another, became one unified sphere, but still the same 25 foot diameter. As soon as they unified, they instantly disappeared or rather dematerialized.  No smoke, no light, no noise.  Nothing.  Just silently dematerialized. I immediately checked my watch and it was 2:25pm.  I looked around to see if any other bystanders had noticed.  No one on the street at the time was looking up in that direction.  I asked a street vendor if she noticed anything and she said she had not.  I asked another gentleman standing near me (he was focusing on his phone at the time) if he saw or sensed anything and he said he did not. The entire sighting took place in less than 10 seconds.",

The others were moving into diamond and triangular shapes.  They continued to hover when the fireworks around the city were going off as if watching a show. It started to get creepy so we all decided to go inside. I posted what I had saw on Facebook and noticed the next day it wasn't just us that saw them, so did hundreds of others around the state.  I can say for sure that they were not chinese lanterns.  They were wobbling up and down like a dot but stationary at all times.

Their color was flaming and flickering, whilst they glided in a diagonal-like ascension.  One by one they were out of sight, gliding slowly until they disappeared.  It was hard to see how far they were from me, but they looked like they were quite far up in the sky, thus their size was so tiny.  I've never seen anything like them before, and I assume there could have been more before I got to that viewpoint and started my gazing...I skygaze at the night sky quite a bit, and have never seen anything like these before.

From the Bayview District in San Francisco California On Friday December 13th 2013 At approx. 7:45 PM I was observing through binoculars extremely heavy traffic on US Hwy 280 looking northeast from my living room window, lowering the field glasses for a moment I observed one red light.. then two..  moving into my field of view from over the top of my home moving from the South toward the North.  Then looking through my Binoculars I saw they were in formation and each had slowed to a virtual crawl.   I now suddenly realized each had two small but obvious red lights an equal distance horizontally from each other though not apparently supported by any visible structure but in an identical configuration.  I thought it strange the first apparent red light had now become four in the time it took for me to find and view them through my Binoculars - a maximum duration of perhaps three seconds - and all had slowed to a slow crawl seemingly \"floating\"  without collapsing toward each other as objects do when receding into the distance. I further saw they were in an obvious formation across from one another. From my perspective as I experienced this first sighting - I judged them to be at least a half mile away in the vicinity of one another though not apparently connected and obviously not conventional aircraft like Jet or Prop driven aircraft or helicopters. Within one minute they slowly crossed the short distance to the left behind the big cedar tree behind my house and were then totally obscured from view. I thought it quite strange. I continued to view the stalled traffic on the freeways through my binoculars for Approx. five minutes when I suddenly noticed a very bright and rapidly pulsating light directly North of my location which I estimated to be perhaps a mile away and about 5 to 600 feet above the Mission District of San Francisco - Approx. the Area of Potrero Blvd. and the Hwy. 101 and 280 interchange.  Shifting my position I saw a second object identical in appearance to the first vibrating light light as well in an identical, abet bizarre fashion somewhat northeast to the first and partially obscured by the same ceder tree which had shortly prior obscured my initial odd sighting of the four red lights, I watched in amazement and fascination  as they seemingly hovered motionless and in unison.  This continued for Approx four minutes before I quickly went to my computer to contact my online community in the SF area to inquire if they too could see what I was witnessing.  One friend a few miles to the west said she could see a bright stationary light hovering over the area of the Mission Dist. She wrote: \"I saw a VERY bright, large light on the southeastern sky.  At first I thought it was a plane, but it was not moving.  Then I thought perhaps it was a planet, but it was pretty low on the horizon\".  After a few minutes exchanging excited online messages I returned to my position on the couch and again saw the bright light nearly exactly where I had first seen it as a vibrating light in a few minutes prior, the second object wasn't immediately visible but quite quickly I grabbed the binoculars and my camera and ran out of my home and around the block to where I would have an unrestricted view of the entire sky.  This took Approx. 90 seconds but there was nothing unusual visible at that time or location. i observed for ten minutes before returning home and calling the police.",

      "story": "Three dim lights moving linearly in locked, triangle formation, stars seen between them This happened over 10 years ago, probably 1999 or 2000. I was walking south-east on 7th street in San Francisco, about 1 block north of the I-80 overpass.  It was sometime between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM.  I was returning to my office after spending the evening with some friends (I was not intoxicated). I was looking up to see what stars were visible through the light pollution, as it was a clear night.  I had grown up in more rural areas of the Midwest, and enjoyed stargazing, although I had never taken the time to learn more than a handful of star and constellation names. As I looked south, over a low (2-3-story) building across the street, I noticed very distant/faint light moving at a steady velocity against the stars in the background.  The movement was about two-thirds of the way up from the horizon to the zenith.  It was so faint that I would easily have missed it had I not been looking intently in its general direction. As I focused on this movement, I realized that it was three very faint lights in a triangular shape.  The lights were close together, perhaps one-third to one-half the diameter of a full moon overhead.  These lights were moving from a southerly direction to a northerly direction.  Because of the perceived distance, if it had been a single light, I would have assumed it was a satellite and thought nothing more of it.  I did assume it was a high-altitude aircraft, but I was intrigued by the fact that the lights were solid, when I expected to see flashing lights. As I watched, I realized that the formation of lights passed in front of a star, and I could clearly see the star between the lights.  This happened with other stars, leading me to realize that the lights were not on a solid object, but rather moving together in a formation. I watched more intently to see if the formation shifted.  It seemed to be locked very rigidly, and I saw no evidence of the lights moving relative to one another.  I also realized that there was no sound from the craft(s).  (There was little traffic on the overpass that time of night, so I would have heard a small plane, helicopter or jet.)  I don't recall a rotational motion, but it's possible they were rotating around a central point very slowly.  Otherwise, they moved in a straight line, southerly to northerly, just to the north-west of the zenith.  I do not recall if they moved with one light in the lead. I stopped watching the lights after they moved to the north side of the street.  I do not recall if they were no longer visible, or if I just lost interest (after a few minutes, they exhibited no new behavior). The memory of seeing these lights has stayed with me very clearly for over 13 years, and I have been curious what they were.",

We were nearing the Bay Bridge, in the water between Treasure Island and the Ferry Building.   I noticed a commercial aircraft flying high overhead, heading south.  Near that plane I saw what at first appeared to be a smaller plane in the distance, but near the same trajectory of the commercial airline.  I thought it seemed a little close.   The smaller object appeared to be white in color with a non-descript shape.  The commercial plane continued on it's path, and the small object was observed to be higher up and not moving in a direction.   I pointed the object out to my wife and she also observed it.  At that point, I began to question what it was I was seeing.   The object then seemed to be moving very slowly, across the bay (west to east), all the while the ferry was moving south under the bridge and so the precise motion of the object was difficult to dete! rmine.  However, as we continued to watch the object, it seemed to be extremely high up and more overhead (I had to crane my neck in order to continue observing it). The object appeared to be shinny, round; a sphere.  It was small in size, being so high up.  It was not moving position that I could tell, not on a trajectory across the sky. It seemed to be staying directly over the bay.  I continued to observe the object for about 15-20 minutes.  I tried to take photos of it but it was too far away for our 200MM lens to capture it.  The sky was completely clear, bright blue, no clouds, sunshine.   The object eventually just seemed to disappear, and I could not find it in the sky.",

August 30, 2014.    At about 4:15 a.m. sighting I usually wake up once in the wee hours of the mornin, and ritualistically, I then go to the kitchen to get a \u201cswig\u201d of orange juice.  I had just done that and was going to go back to bed, but remembered that the gated parking garage, adjacent to the short \u201chigh-rise\u201d condo complex that I live in, was not gated for the past two days.  Since I have a vehicle in that lot, and the vehicle is exposed to the street, I decided to take a look out of my living room window, which overlooks the parking lot, to check on my truck.  I had been a little worried about the truck overnight, because we have a ton of auto burglaries on our street, and in general, a lot of scuzzy people walking around up to no good late at night, early a.m. In order to get a good look at the parking lot, I had to lie down (on my belly), on my carpet.  We have a large window but the shade is always drawn, so I decided to lie down and look out the window.  Truck was fine and I didn\u2019t see anyone around but I noticed some lights on in a dilapidated building kitty corner to ours.  Since I wasn\u2019t feeling sleepy, I went and got my binoculars and took a look.  I was checking out the dilapidated building when it happened. I THINK I heard the low hum first.  The rest, I am absolutely 100% sure about.  I looked to my left, and a GIANT rectangular, flat, object was \u201cfloating\u201d slowly in my direction from up high \u2013 gliding long side up, and then closer and closer.  It sort of \u201ctwisted\u201d slowly, which was a movement that I found incredulous for any manmade air craft.  It made no sense.   It then hovered for a time (maybe 2 minutes?) and it was \u201cfacing\u201d me at a diagonal/slanted  angle.  There was a white light (not blinking) on each corner of the craft.  In the first moments of seeing this thing, my brain was trying to categorize it as an airplane or some kind of military jet and I couldn\u2019t understand why there were only white lights as I know that our aircraft use colored lights to indicate port side or starboard.   Then the shape of the object was clear to me.  It was SO CLOSE and SO LOW.  And since it hovered for what seemed like a long time, I had a long time to look at it.  But even so, I feel fuz! zy about what it really looked like with specific details.  I know that at the moment I realized it was absolutely a UFO, I was in absolute shock at what I was witnessing.  Then, it put itself on a more horizontal level, and glided up, and headed in a northern direction. I live in a part of the city that has heavy construction so I speculate that the craft was interested in all of the construction going on, but I also assume it knew I was watching it. My husband was sleeping in the other room.  I didn\u2019t call out for him because I didn\u2019t want to disturb what was happening by making a huge commotion, and even though I wished so badly I could go grab my camera I didn\u2019t want to miss a moment of what I was seeing. Weather:  it was very, very dark out (for an urban city).  Our street actually is not very well lit, which is unusual for the neighborhood.  The sky was dark, but I could tell it was clear overhead and I could see off on the northern horizon that there was a heavy band of low fog.  That was the direction the craft took off for. I could NOT believe what I was seeing.  To say the experience was shocking is an understatement. Conditions:  practically pitch black with some city lights.",

This evening, as I was leaving my house in the outer Parkside district of San Francisco,  (I live on 44th Avenue), I noticed an object in the sky westward with flashing sequencial Red Lights.  The Fog had already began to cover most of my view of the sky, which means I would not be able to see any stars tonight. However, Commercial Planes coming from and leaving San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose would still be visible by their flashing navigation lights upon departure and approach to their respective airports.  This was not one of them.   My neighbor also noticed the object and we both attempted to try and figure out what it might be.  The object remained fairly stationary for about 15 minutes.  Occasionaly it would appear to drift to the right, then to the left, and then return back to its original position. Both my neighbor and I suggested that it might be someones toy drone that they were flying above the Fog (I would estimate that it would have been at least 5  to 15 feet across to account for the number of lights on the object).  With that said, I still can not ruled out that I was looking at something else, not man-made. After watching it for 15 minutes the object began to move westward towards the Pacific Ocean while also drifting northward and southward in a pattern similar to a sign wave. After It moved far enough away, I lost sight of it due to the roof of my neighbor's house across the street from my house. Red Light Sequence:  &lt;--------------*-&gt; Ooooooooooooooo.oo ^ All Red lights except for the Right most light would sometimes appear to be blue, white, or green in random order.",

The event didn't light up the night sky or make any noise.It was kind of mellow & magical feeling and I know for sure it was no \"dud\" of a fireworks rocket or something because there would've been some sound & I would've seen the thing being shot up into the sky if it was some 4th of july dud rocket.  Because what I saw happened right before my eyes from start to finish.  And the streams of energy that made up the blast effect looked way different than any of the 4th of July firworks I have ever seen & the slow speed at which it opened up you could tell it was no firework.   The ball of light fell at normal speed & probably over the water but the horizon line of the city was a little foggy so I couldn't tell if it may have landed over land.  There were about 12 to 14 thick streams of light that made up the initial portal opening.they weren't too bright & they just faded away as the ball of light leaving the staggered trail of plasma fell out of it.

He thought he was looking for a helicopter but it was not.  He saw what he called something weird, triangle shaped with green, red, and blue lights.  It continued to fly away and come back, again with noise.  Could this be a helicopter?  The sound he noticed and his best instincts say that it was not.

It came down and surrounded my whole location and stayed there for 6 hours or so.  When these navigate around they are blue grey and black in color and seem to be plasma and variable size.   This was near the Eagle's Point Labyrinth along the pacific trail.  Associated with these are smaller triangular craft with three red lights on the bottom that trail two fibers behind them.   This was early Monday morning. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to contact the source of the report, but the telephone number is non-functional.

I was unable to view any stars in the sky at the time, just a cluster of pulsing lights. The craft seemed rather large considering there were commercial airliners in the forefront of the frame and the object, in the distance was still much larger than them.",

      "story": "Mystery Giant White Blimp Like Object Over Oakland We witnessed a blimp like object that appeared to be circling the Oakland airport area. It was massive. Had some sort of black unknown text writing and possibly had people below. My girlfriend and I observed from our patio overlooking (with binoculars) and have pictures to support. It had a red blinking light on the bottom and looked very strange.  We've lived here for over 3 years and have never seem anything like it. Our view is of the entire east bay and we can see the Oakland airport on a clear day. However, this stood out.  To start, we've never seen anything like such described. It was huge and from first glance all white. It was easy to dismiss as a normal blimp but in retrospect we've had a change of thought.  Like I stated, we've never seen anything like that before. It stood out. And the next day I remembered how strange it was to observe. So I googled every type of search that would pull it up. Found NOTHING. I mean NOTHING. I find it incredibly hard to believe that everyone in SF didn't comment on it and also take pics. If it was just another blimp why would it not be mentioned online somewhere.  Which leads me here. I can't find a single picture online of this.  I believe it was probably an emergency landing and not intended to be seen. It might have been some sort of military craft. Hard to say. Like I stated, it was easy to pass off as a normal blimp. And sadly, we didn't watch longer to see how it landed. I tried to film it but from our distance it only look like a large white spot. The picture are better. But what we saw in the binoculars is the most compelling. The writing was not legible. It looked like symbols. And it was far from what you would think was a promotional blimp.  If was a normal blimp, we would've seen it before. And the black out of it online makes me believe we weren't supposed to see it.  I think it could be a weather modification blimp that malfunctioned and needed to make an emergency landing. Hope you can provide more insight.  I'm not sure how to send the picture but will if your interested.   Thanks for being here. Hope your not the MIB haha",

My wife had her phone in her hand and took two photos seconds apart the spheres were moving,  After looking at the photo, we were surprised to see three additional oval UFO\u2019s (nearly transparent) near the spheres, one of the oval UFO\u2019s looks like it has landed on top of a building.  Looking back up we were unable to see the transparent UFO\u2019s with our naked eye, but they are visible by photo.  The two spheres moved away and out of our view.  Very strange.",
