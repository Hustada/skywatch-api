Craft was about 40 feet off the ground.Silent The light went red right next to it,so I stopped. Craft may have been moving very slowly,like walking speed,because as soon as I stopped it floated over my vehicle and passed us going southwest about 2-3 mph. I actually could have gotten out ,picked up a rock and hit it easily. on the ride back to hernando we passed 2 others of the same look,they were traveling south parallel to hwy us 41,about 1/4 mile from roadway. I posted this Before and My email was released somehow resulting in a government spook sending me some disturbing correspondance.",

Craft was traveling in the WSW sky from Tampa approx. 240 degrees, going west until dropped from visible sight due to distance. Estimate of distance offshore from Tampa \u2013 if it was in the atmosphere 30-40 miles out and 40,000 feet high \u2013 would have needed to be traveling multiple mach, example hyper-sonic, Mach 5-6 is guess.  If it was exo-atmosphere, it would have needed to be significantly faster, as it crossed the sky at a 45 degree angle, going away from us, going from very visible to distant, to out of sight in 4-5 seconds.   I am open to being contacted if investigation is made. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and he sounded to us to be very serious, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter See below original summary, but I thought about something today that is interesting Last night, the reason we saw this object in the first place, is because we were focused on an area of the sky, that had a flickering light, I had just told my wife, that is a satellite, not a star, because of the evident flicker, those are the solar panels\u2026.  We were using an app on my android phone called \u201cSkyview\u201d \u2013 this app shows all object in the sky including satellites, spent rockets etc\u2026   The flickering light was stationary and Bright.  The Phone app did not recognize it, I tried to load update to the app, to see if it would then identify. Then, we saw the fast moving object, directly from same general location.  I stopped thinking about the flickering object, and am not certain if it remained\u2026  I believe it did.  So I do not think the fast object was the original Flickering object\u2026 but small chance it was the same.  I am just not certain now, as I did not connect the 2 objects last night\u2026 only today did I think about the location and the possibility that they were in some way connected. Also, you said last night that there was a similar report from Arkansas, and also something reported West of Spokane.  I used Google Earth, and made a Pin Drop out West of Tampa over the Gulf.  Another West of Spokane, and noted that the line traverses directly over Arkansas.  (See attached) Let me know if you have any questions Also \u2013 What were the times the Arkansas and Spokane reported?  I believe mine was very close to 2300 EST ((END ADDENDUM))",

I do not drink and was the designated driver.  After dropping off my friends, at about 2:30 AM,  I drove into my driveway and stepped out of my car.  I closed the car door and then fumbled on my key ring for the key to my house. I moved away from the car using what I thought to be moonlight to find my key.  When I looked up to my left,  over my pool area there was a large saucer shaped object suspended over my house, my pool, and also sections of my neighbors house.  I could not tell how high up it was nor how large since I had no reference about the object to compare.  The moonlight glow was coming from the bottom of the object where several lights appeared around the bottom outline of the object.  The lights were not round, but, rectangular with a space between each.  The lights began to rotate counterclockwise then a round center area lit up as well.  The center was a softer glow than the outer edge.  The object moved west over my house very slowly and with absolutely no sound.  I ran to the front of the house to continue to view it, but, it moved straight upward and the lights were shut off.  I was left in darkness.

      "story": "My family were visiting disney world Christmas of 1987.  Because the family was from Winnipeg Manitoba Canada, we were staying in Tampa Bay Florida for half the duration of our trip (2 weeks)to Florida.  The other week was to be spent at bush gardens at a different hotel.  The hotel we were staying at was called the The Sonyesta.  On or around the night of 19 Dec 1987 we decided to visit a restaurant called King Henry's Feast in Miami.  We left the hotel in Tampa at around 16:00 on the 19th and drove to Miami.  The King Henry's Feast was a Medieval style dinner and show and the whole affair lasted many hours so by the time we left Miami to go back to our hotel in Tampa bay it was quite late, around 0:00. At around 1:00 am we were on a deserted stretch of highway near - as far as I can remember- swampy country with scattered palm trees.  Because it was somewhat dark I can only remember seeing flat ground with telltale plantlife that indicated swamp such as sparsh high grass, rushes and bumpy, in some places, reflective ground indicating stagnant water in addition to the dark outlines of palm trees.  I remember that the moon was full when we left Miami but at 1:00 on the highway it became foggy. My memory becomes hazy at this point, but I recall other cars stopped by the road and people looking at something in the sky.  I recall the other passengers in the car gasp and say \"oh look!\".  I recall seeing three other people besides the passengers in our car.  The other peoples cars seemed to have headlights on. The passengers of our car consisted of 4 people.  Firstly myself age 7.  I was at that age an avid camper with my parents and that is how I knew what swamp looked like.  I am now 28 and a Captain in the PPCLI, a Canadian Infantry unit and I have seen action in Afghanistan.  My father is a doctor who practiced at the St James Clinic and Misecordia hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada.  My Mother was or was studying at the time, to take her bar exam.  She has been called to the bar in Winnipeg and British Columbia Canada.  She no longer practices law but is a stay at home Mom for my younger siblings who were not yet born at the time.  The final passenger was my Dad's mother and my grandma who is now deceased but at the time worked at a clothing store for senior citizens in Winnipeg. My Father and Mother were in the front 2 seats of the car and my Grandmother and me in the back.  As we approached what I remember to be one or two cars pulled over at the side of the road with people beside them I perceived 6 light blue glowing lights rotating in the sky.  Each was the size of a quarter in my memory, but only because they were some distance away.  I seem to recall we got out of the car at this point to look at the lights but I have another memory of staying in the car the whole time.  The lights did nothing but rotate, in my memory at an angle and down towards our car.  The whole scene-like a picture- was us, bottom right ground, road bottom middle, other people and cars bottom left.  Mid right was shadow of palm trees, mid center was fog but flat bumpy ground, mid right was fog, top right fog, top center fog with some traces of moonlight seeping through and top right were the six blue lights rotating at an angle facing us. I do not recall how long we lingered watching the lights but at some point during this time I recall glancing out of curiosity at the other people near our car and to our left to see if they were as amazed as us.  I recall a man with shaved head and glasses in a white shirt looking calmly back at me with an amused expression.  I have conlicting memories of this man; one memory that he was in another car and I saw him through a window and another memory that he was outside the cars to my left at about 9 feet away. At this point I draw a blank and do not recall if the lights disappeared or we just got bored and decided to leave.  We got back to Tampa Bay and had no other encounters since.  After returning to Canada at the end of the vacation we did not discuss at all afterwards memories of the vacation.  Anytime I brought up the issue of the lights my mother scolded me, dismissed the event or made fun of me so I soon let the matter drop. Upon remembering this event last year in September 2007, I questioned my father and mother at a restaurant and it took them by surprise.  I said simpley \"do you remember the 6 blue rotating lights in Florida?\"  My father remarked off hand (and without any prompting from me) that there were lots of people watchig the event.  My mother then remarked that she had no memory of other people there.  We were all 3 of us discussing the event further in the car and my mother became very agitated and angry while my father seemed very curious and trying to remember more, or so it seemed to me.  My Mother did give me a detail I had not remembered-my Grandmother had decided to purchase communion which was a book about alien abduction.  My Mother told me all this nonsense about UFOs was due to my Grandmother scaring me.  I do not recall ever discussing the event with my Grandmother at all. Please let me know if anyone has had a similar experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

My Fiancee' was digging through his wallet for his pass, and I was looking to the south, up at the sky.  The sky was bright blue and the only clouds to be seen were two thin, wispy clouds at a very high elevation.  It was a very bright and sunny day. As I looked at the sky, I noticed a flying craft appear directly in front of where I was viewing.  I had not noticed the craft at all in my peripheral vision. The craft seemed to be flying at about the elevation I see helicopters flying at frequently.  Maybe a little higher.  The craft had the look like it was surrounded by a haze, and it appeared to be a solid dark grey color.  It also looked like it was flat on the bottom and hill shaped on top.  I did not see any wings or propellers on the craft.  It was flying in an easterly direction, and it appeared to be going pretty slow. Slower than I've ever seen an airplane fly.   It appeared to be gliding along.  I didn't really think much about the craft, figuring it was probably a helicopter or something, until it disappeared right in front of me.  I observed the craft for probably a couple of seconds, and then it appeared to fade and disappear completely.  It did not reappear.  I was going to say something to my fiancee', but, he was busy with the cashier, and I really didn't believe my own eyes enough to tell my fiancee' that I thought I saw a ufo.  I stared at the spot where I had seen it, hoping it would reappear, when ANOTHER craft materialized where the last one had.  This one was a little higher in elevation (not much) than the previous one.  It looked identical to the previous craft and was moving at the same speed.  This time I wanted to tell my fiancee so that I could have another witness, but he was still talking to the cashier.  It glided by for a couple of seconds and then proceeded to fade and disappear at about the same spot as the previo! us craft I think from the time I saw the crafts to the time they disappeared they might have traveled 1/4 mile.  They were moving very very slow.  There wasn't anything blocking my sight anywhere around me.  I had a clear view all around me of the sky.  I continued to watch for another couple of minutes to see if they did infact reappear somewhere else, but, I did not see the crafts anytime again after that.",

The light again disappeared into the sky.  I am not sure what I saw, but if others saw something thing strange than so be it.  I should also mention that this was in the general direction of Mcdill AFB. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

As it rang, the lights came back on and I saw a single light cross the over my car from S to N.   My girlfriend told me when we got back to the apartment that she never saw my tail lights go out and her phone never rang.  I put the phone down and saw another light cross over my car from S to N. The lights were white, steady and round.  I was in moderate traffic so I wasn't able to give the lights more than a glance so I couldn't estimate speed or altitude.  I assume other people saw them because the traffic in front of me slowed down to 45mph as this was going on.  It reminded me of driving under a plane as it comes in for a landing.

      "date": "",
      "story": "abducted as a child in Tampa, FL, in the 1960s   I was a sleeping elementary school age child, in my own room and in my own bed in Tampa, FL when suddenly, there was light in my room,except the room had no overhead light and I hadn't turned on the light next to my bed. This bedside lamp was the only normal source of light in this room. It was off but there was still much light. This had never happened before. I had a fast impression of someone being next to my bed. I saw, momentarily, what I perceived to be blue jeans on a man's lower body then, with the light still on, but no one next to me,there was suddenly a lot of noise and commotion. In the next instant, \"The Sound of Music\" record played very loudly, presumably from the little portable record player in our living room. My room shared a common wall with the living room. When it went on, I sat bolt upright in bed. My first thought was that someone was there to murder us but I dismissed that idea with the thought that murderers probably didn't make all of this commotion-a killer would be quiet. The music was turned up so loudly that I couldn't believe that my siblings would do something this unusual and dangerous, knowing how violent our parents were. Whichever child was doing this was risking a horrible beating FOR SURE. I touched my bedroom wall with my hand to prove to myself that I was awake. The wall was solid and normal and I could see and feel the paint. I believed I was awake and I laid back down, in terror. Someone was present and making a tremendous amount of ruckus. I was shaking. Then there was a staticy feeling in the air. The room was now dark, the music stopped. I went into shock when I then saw 4 grotestue, blue, wrinkled troll-looking beings in what looked to me to be blue overalls. They were lined up in front of my closet. I thought they looked like drums because they were as stout as they were tall. They weren't tall like a human, they were maybe 3 1/2 - 4 feet tall9maybe smaller) and so wide they were like squares.I must presume that the light must have been back on for me to see them so clearly, to be able to make out color but I didn't think about the light. I was rapidly processing that these were real aliens and this event was really happening, then I was paralyzed. I felt like every molecule in my body was being pulled through the soles of my feet. I fought with all of my will but could not stop the paralysis or the pulling, which was happening very fast. I was totally and completely terrified. The next thing I can remember is being on a grate-type bridge walkway that went into a building or something large. I had the thought that \"this is definately happening to me and no one, not even my mother, will ever be able to help me. I wondered if they were going to keep me. Then, things get confusing in my own ability to be sure of the order of any of the following things that happened. In the place with all the grating, someone was somehow, maybe telepathically telling me that there was a problem somewhere. I was shown a darkened room with giant preying mantises just walking around. I think there was a window or something between me and them because they didn't seem to notice or care about me in any way. Then I was shown a cloaked being in the same room I was in, who I automatically presumed was an old what-ever-she-was because she was very wrinkled and seemed very weak. I was shown this from a perspective of first being behind \"her\", to her right. I saw the dark cloak then the being who was at my side walked me up to look at her face. He told me more about the problem these beings had but its vaque to me. My impression was that whatever the problem was it had led to her appearance and weakness. I remember being in a smaller craft, seeing the stars go by very fast through a window, feeling very alone, and once again realizing that this was real. I definately thought then that I was the only human in this craft. They didn't treat me like a child. There was no comfort offerred, no food, no water, no blanket and no one to help me. It was all matter-fact, like in this transport the beings were just performing a normal routine thing. Again, I'm not sure of the order of events as I only have snippets of scenes in my memory. I remeber walking, with no resistence and not much fear, concern or even interest now. I just went along willingly. I don't know who was with me at this point but my best recollection is of someone short. We passed two human-looking beings to our left. There was a little girl with dark brown or black hair just kind of standing to the left of a large glass cylinder. A human man with dark hair was in the large cylinder. It looked like a large test tube. They didn't take any significant notice of me and oddly I now realize, I didn't make any effort to communicate with them. We never made eye contact. I never even tried to. As we kept walking, he(?), the being, now on my right, continued telling me I don't remember what-until he had me look down at small horizontal portals or screens that showed different military things including an arial view of a large rocket with smoke and \"things\" flying around it. My impression was \"war\" I felt sadness and I definately said or thought loudly \"If you know all this, show me how I'm going to die\" and he did. He showed me a larger vertical screen and I watched myself, as an adult woman with long dark hair walking alone into a high floor of a ski chalet. There was a large picture window and I looked out upon a beautiful scene below of trees and lots of snow. Now, at this point, I feel more like I'm living it rather than watching it. I walked toward the main living room type area. Maybe 8, 10 people were in the living room, most sitting on sofas and some just milling about. I remember thinking that there should be no problem here because I knew most or all of the people. I started to walk to a sofa to sit down and a man just came up behind me and slit my throat. It felt like a true event happening in real time. I felt like I was blacking out, dying, and my last thought in this scenario was \"I can't believe this could happen. I know all of these people. Why isn't someone helping me? Was this a plot they were all in together?\". Then I was back, standing in front of this vertical scene, with the being who had no emotion about my death scene. None. I asked so he showed me. It was just a matter of future history, nothing personal on his part in any way. From there, things are very \"fuzzy\". I felt like I was lying down, in a different place, kind of flooating, then on(?) a white table, with doctors around me and the table, mostly to the left side of me. I felt euphoric-a feeling I would now liken to a narcotic only more exaggerated. One of the doctors said my name!  I felt something like a metal rocket-shaped 'thing' being inserted. I was somehow okay with this!  The next memory is of me in a small spaceship, traveling in my parent's yard to my bedroom window. The being piloting, to my left, was very blond and looked almost like a human male adult but my sense was that he was not human. His skin was too white-opague and his demeanor was like \"nothing\". There only seemed to be room for the two of us in this craft but I could see all around us. I think he telepathically mentioned ants and aloe vera as we flew over some. I'm not sure if I really remember the aloe vera-ant thing or if I conflabbed it. We were very low to the ground. We neared my window and I thought \"Oh, we're going in my window\" but we did not. Still in the small craft, I remeber vividly that I felt very raw (emotionally, not physically), invaded, disappointed, very saddened. Something had been taken from me, from my body. I felt a sad emptiness and the being imparted to me \"Its done. There's nothing you can do about it\" My regret seemed to surprise or confuse this being. Maybe even irritation would describe his affect. This was the only millisecond of \"feeling\" that I received from him. \"Disturbance of the norm\"  I heard two whistling, spinning noises, I felt cold, I felt a little spinning then I SAW my own bedcovers UNDER me as I flew into place in my own bed. I don't recall waking up that morning but I obviously did and just went about the morning like it was a normal day. I remembered later in the same day that this had happened. I was walking from my elementary school lunchroom, in line with my classmates, headed back to class when I remembered. I knew the word schizophrenic and knew if I told my mother she would take me to a psychiatrist and that would be what they would say. I knew it had really happened but believed I was the only person in all of history that this had happened to or would happen to. I made my mind up on that sidewalk that day that for my own protection, I could never tell a living soul. I have no idea if this was one event or numerous events that my mind has spliced together. I only remember the paralysis and sucking through the feet feeling happening one other time. I was even more terified the second time and totally determined not to go again. With all my will and strenghth, I moved my right little finger and the paralysis was broken. I've never had the feeling again, never been taken anywhere and have had no conscious awareness of any aliens anywhere since then. The most important thing I can tell you is that when I returned home from school that day and went to use our restroom, I had a straight red line from my naval to my pubis. It was shocking to me but also forced me to admit the reality of this whole thing to myself. The red line looked like a perfect surgical incision had been made and closed but there were no suture marks, no staples, no apparent source of closure. The red line was perfectly straight and is visible to this day. It has become a thin brown line visible from about 3 inches from my naval down to the top of the pubis. I definately welcome inspection of this \"scar\" by medical researchers. No doctor or boyfriend has ever noticed or commented on it. Later, maybe 5 or 10 years later when I first read of animal mutalations, I had chills and anxiety. I felt certain this was the work of the beings who took me. I was a straight A student but a compartmentalized nervous wreck from then until recently. I could not become truly emotionally connected to anyone and I lived in complete terror that something like this would happen to my own daughters. When they came to take me the second time, I felt I was marked in some way or how would they know to take ME again?  Since in the death scenario I had long dark hair and was an adult - once I became an adult I dyed my hair blond, kept it short and knew I would never live in or go to places with ski chalets and snow. Now 54, I find myself in Colorado because I need to live near my oldest daughter who lives here. She is my primary care giver and I truly need her help - so I'm here. I have a devastating terminal disease. Prior to this disease I now have, I lived only in hot places -FL and NV I was so determined to not live out the death scene. I have neuromyelitis optica and I am now blind. My immune system is shredding my nervous system one cranial nerve at a time. This began in the 80's.It is a very rare disease and one of the few conditions that causes both blindness and paralysis in the patient, then leads to death by the failure of the intercoastal muscles.  I hated the beings my whole life. I hated that they took an innocent, already traumatized child without even asking the child. It was a violent kidnapping in my opinion. Now that I am aware of so many stories similar to mine, I'm calmer in one respect(I'm not the ONLY one) but now, I'm very concerned for all humankind. What is going on?!  I have been diagnosed with PTSD from chilhood abuse and adult onset PTSD from going blind. A more correct diagnosis would have been lifelong PAS, I have no doubt. To clarify one of answers regarding number of craft seen-I said 3. I may have seen one from the outside, in my yard, during the same event but everything else was inside a craft. I count them as 1-the grating & preying mantises, the little girl, the death scene and the medical stuff 2-the craft in which I was flown rapidly by a military type \"crew\" and 3- the tiny ship from which the blond took me across the yard and into my room. I had a horrible childhood in every possible way because of the on-going anxiety and terror from this event, the constant beatings from my adoptive parents and a year of molestation by my 5th grade teacher. I became a life-long loner. In the 90s, I told one friend and both of my daughters of the event. All three said they believed me, which makes it possible for me to tell you now. I also told a boyfriend who was a paramedic and is now a nurse in a infant and children's trauma ward in LV. He did not believe my story was real but does believe that I believe it. He believes that this is a cover story created by my mind because I cannot accept that I was raped as a child. He doesn't believe in UFOs and thinks we are alone in this vast universe. I was NOT raped as a child. Beaten by parents, molested by a teacher but there was no rape event. I can't really care if anyone believes me or not. It doesn't change any of what happened. I feel like my whole life was stolen from me. I've not had one day since the event that I felt normal or that I fit in anywhere. There is some relief in knowing that people, lots of people worldwide, now know of these kinds of abductions and that there is at least investigation being done now. I used to pray that one day there would be a registry or someway to tell legitimate researchers and scientists what happened to me in the hope of one day really understanding why they picked me. Because I believe it neccessary for my good mental health to forgive them, I do, to a point, but I still hate the little, blue drum-like ones who took me with absolutely no regard for me, my terror, my youth. I like to think that if they ever came along now that I wouln't be frightened of them. I think I would be bold and demand some answers this time. I worry about, but also look forward to some kind of event where all the abductees are made known to the world so people will know that this really happened to lots of us and perhaps, is still happening to some people, especially children. I believe I saw 6 different kinds of aliens : 1-the horrible little blue drum-like ones who took me, 2-the preying mantises,3- the \"crew\" of the shuttle 4-the \"explainer\" who walked me past the two humans and showed me the \"war\" pictures and my own alleged death. 5- the doctors and 6-the very white man who took me home through my ceiling. Very oddly, I have no direct recall of any of the \"greys\" with the big eyes, claimed by so many abductees but I also can't tell you what the\"crew\" or the \"explainer\" or the doctors looked like at all. I don't know why I can't remember something this important, but in 40+ years I've never remembered their faces. I was adopted at birth from McDill AFB and have speculated that the doctor who knew my name might have been a human military doctor. In 1979 I had to have an emergency surgical procedure (a right oophorectomy) because my right ovary had become gangrenous from \"torsion of the tube\". No eggs were visible in this ovary upon removal nor upon follow-up microscopic examination. No doctor was able to explain this or determine where my eggs were,  or if there had ever been any in that ovary. I had a normal pregnancy in 1980 and gave birth to my second daughter. She has extra vertebrae in her neck and was born with eyes so almond-shaped I worried for a time that she might be mongoloid. She is not. In 1983, following the 1979 removal of my right ovary and a 1982 surgical procedure to eliminate some of the remaining left fallopian tube to insure contraception, and with my partner having had a vasectomy, I was told that I was pregnant again. I lost the baby and all the attending physician would tell me is that the baby was not normal. I was not shown the baby. In 2008, following 7 years of total menopause and having no partner for 8 months, as my boyfriend had died, I was again told I was pregnant. I was 52 years old. I was hospitalized for 3 days and all 12 blood pregnancy tests came back positive, as well as all urine tests. The hospital lab was in a bit of an uproar about \"the old, blind pregnant lady with no partner\". I was released into the care of my family practioner who administered a blood pregnancy test in her office two weeks later. It came back negative. (The emergency room doctor seemed extremely interested in the fact that I had torsion of the tube in my 20s but he never elaborated. He just seemed very excited and interested in this fact. So much so that I wondered then and I wonder now, WHY was this of so much interest to him? As his name is on the medical record as the admitting doctor, I hope one day someone will ask him why this was a big deal to him. No other medical professional has ever raised an eyebrow when I mention it, yet he was incredulous and focused on it at length. He then performed an ultrasound and determined that my womb was empty. He admitted me, baffled). Because I had chemotherapy in 2007-09 for this neuromyelitis optica, my doctor believes I was experiencing endocrine changes. I think this is likely correct as I have had no other encounters since the 60s of which I am aware. Truthfully, I think the neuromyelitis is a result of both the chil abuse and the abduction. I think it was all too much for my nervous system. I see a very qualified neuro-opthomologist who has no idea at all why I have this disease. I've never had the courage to tell any medical professional treating me or any mental health professional of the abduction because I believe they will label me \"insane\". I'm not. I have been troubled and anxious for 40+ years. I have attempted suicide too many times to count (okay, 5). The most recent event, in 2008, was a compulsive act that I felt was not entirely of my own accord. Suddenly, one afternoon, I wanted very much to put a screwdriver through my left wrist, which makes absolutely no sense to me. I did not do that but with almost an uncontrollable intensity, I took an over-dose of Wellbutrin and Prozac. Somehow, I took just the right combination for the drugs to balance each other out and though I spent the night in intensive care, I had almost no effect from the 15 pills or more that I ingested. No nausea, no vomiting, no convulsions, not even a hiccough. I can't believe how out of control of myself I felt while taking the over-dose. It was a manic event that still doesn't make sense to me. Never have I heard of \"death by screwdriver\" and I'm no handyman. Usually, I don't even own a screwdriver and have never at any other time thought about a screwdriver in any odd way like this. I am a mother. If I were really going to intentionally kill myself there is no doubt that I would leave lengthy letters of explanation for my adult daughters. I would make logical plans, I would give away treasured momentos, I would say good-bye to those I love, yet, I didn't do any of this. I just felt  this over-whelming impulse to put a screwdriver through my own wrist. Instead, I took lots of pills very quickly. I remember counting 12, 13, 14...like they were M&Ms, instead of strong medications. I was a medical professional myself (an EMT and medical writer) and NEVER would I do this. And yet, I did. The other 4 attempts prior were clustered from 2001 to 2004 and were also compulsive acts. No planning, just action that seemed to be out of me instead of from me. I tried to jump off a mountain (my daughter decked me to keep me from doing this), I ran out into traffic (everyone stopped), I went to a desolate location in an attempt to die from exposure and starvation (this was clearly going to take a long time and be painful) and I asked someone I didn't know to get heroin for me so I could over-dose. I took twice the amount they said would be dangerous and waited. All I got was a headache. Obviously, I'm not very good at suicide. I don't think I will ever try again because now, if I felt the compulsion, I would resist totally. Enough of my life has been taken from me by others. Once I made the connection that the US military was probably involved in this, which was only recently, I began to feel much stronger but also even more angry. What do I think? I think I was taken by aliens but that the doctor who knew my name was human and that both were somehow benefitting from whatever they did to me. I truly think I was selected because I was an adoptee from an AFB and was already traumatized. Obviously, all of the medical information I am recounting is verifiable through medical and hospital records, which I'm happy to provide to any legitimate researcher. I welcome the opportunity to have truth serum administered and would agree to be hypnotized by a medical professional. In both scenarios I would ask that a video recording be made of the entire questioning procedure and I would want a trained UFO researcher present in both cases. Its taken my whole life to put these snippets together. I remembered some of it that day but was an adult before I realized why I always had to have a rectangular white dining table. I could almost remember but not quite, then one day in Sarasota, FL, following the purchase of my 3rd or 4th white rectangular table, I remembered. I was on one. I think it possibly emitted white light. How else would I know it was white if I was lying on it? I don't remember anyone removing my clothing, nor do I know how my clothing was returned to my body. Unlike the other stories I've been reading on the Internet, I was not shown any babies or told anything about hybrids. I wasn't asked to touch or hold anything or anyone. I now think they took eggs from my right ovary and I think they left the fallopian tube and ovary malpositioned which resulted in the torsion. It might have been intentional because the gangrene certainly made it impossible for doctors to tell what had happened to my right ovary and eggs. I believe they take children because we are closer to their size. Even now as I write this, I feel sick to my stomach and sweaty. I would give most anything to know the whole truth of what happened to me - and apparently others- and WHY. Finally, let me say that I am a professional writer and have been virtually my whole adult life. If I were going to make up a story, I promise you, it would make a lot more sense than this. I WISH I was making it up. Though it happened to me, it remains almost too incredible for me to believe but the scar is still there. Before she passed in 2003, my mother and I spoke of the scar. All she really said was \"yeah, you have had that for a long time.\" I don't know why she said this because NEVER did I show it to her or tell her about it in any way. She never commented if and when she really ever saw it, yet she acted like \"yeah, aliens, no big deal.\" No surprise, no questions. I thank you with my whole heart for providing this forum to people like myself who have kept this horrible secret inside ourselves for our whole lives. I hope someone will contact me and help me sort it out. Due to the blindness, phone contact is the best way to reach me. I would accept a collect call but I only have a cell phone and they don't permit collect calls. I can't read my own e-mail and must have others read it for me. I would prefer not to have to talk about it with anyone except a valid researcher. Thank you very much - and if you are connected to the military in any way DO NOT contact me. And I better not have any MIBs hanging around once I submit this to you. I am so NOT even kidding. If I am contacted by ANYONE except a UFO researcher, I WILL DENY that I wrote this and swear that it never happened. If you are truly valid UFO researchers, I hope you will know by content that this DID happen. Please give me a chance to provide the little proof that I have (the scar).

      "story": "metallic silver object clearly seen hovering in the afternoon over tampa and after a minute of observing vanished without a trace. Time: January 22, 2009, 1:15pm Conditions: clear skies,  sunshine,  and clouds far into the distance Location: New Tampa east of Bruce B downs several lights north of the I75 overpass. On the 22nd,  me and my boyfriend were heading to USF for my class that afternoon.  We were heading from our home down Cross Creek and traveling due south on Bruce B Downs blvd at about 45MPH.  It was a clear Florida afternoon with clouds only in the distant horizon.  Upon crossing the Tampa Palms region my boyfriend had spotted something in the sky and was laughing about how normally people who see UFO\u2019s depict an object which seems very unlikely to be a UFO at all making the whole possibility even more far fetched.  I looked up and saw an object in the sky just beyond the power/telephone lines crossing the road, and once we had passed under these I could clearly see the object without interference. From the passengers seat of his SUV,  the object appeared to be close to a 45 degree angle from the horizon, and about 5 degrees to the left of our car\u2019s heading which looked to be just to the left of the center of the windshield from what I could tell.  The shape was horizontally ovular with more of acute sides on the left and right forming near points.  The texture seemed to be quote slick as the light  reflection from the sun and shadow underneath were relatively free of distortion.  The color of the object to the naked eye seemed to be silver hues or possibly a very metallic white,  but either way the surface had very reflective properties.  The top was very bright white with sunlight,  but the bottom were tones of silver and grey with shadows that looked like slight reflections of the tree line below. Being an aspiring scientist I immediately thought about all the possibilities and scenarios in my head and concluded it must have been a weird shaped blimp for an advertisement at one of the local stores near Amberly dr.  I ruled out a plane instantly because it did not change size to indicate a northern or southern trajectory, and it did not waiver side to side in our view either.  For the clarity of the sky and close proximity to us,  I was able to rule out a helicopter instantly also.  The object made no sound,  had no impact on the tree line below, and no propellers or engines of any sort were visible. Me and my boyfriend stared at the object while slowing down in our drive and I made the comment,  \u201cYou know if this is what people seen when they reported UFO\u2019s I can see how they make that assumption,   after seeing this blimp,  I would nearly claim it were a UFO if I had been startled or had bad eyesight myself.\u201d   As we got a little closer I started thinking how weird it was that the blimp/balloon had no advertisements on it,  no personnel carriage underneath,  or no tie down to a building below.  We kept staring at the object as a full minute had passed with it in our sights and we still had no reasonable theories as to what it was. My boyfriend laughed and stated that it must be a UFO then,  and I agreed since it would be the simplest solution to the situation,  and right when I had said jokingly ,\u201cYay aliens,  how neat!\u201d  the object vanished right before our eyes.  As bizarre as that sounds,  I know.  It reminded me of those home movies where a kid holds up a ball and says, \u201cnow it\u2019s here\u2026\u2026\u2026..now it\u2019s not (and the camera recording breaks for a moment)\u201d  then the ball is suddenly not in the kid\u2019s hand due to 2 separate recordings being edited together.  It was a quick and abrupt vanishing act for this object.  Now neither of us were laughing. I continued watching, scanning, and searching the sky as we drove all the way to campus.  There were still no clouds around,  no chemical trails from an aircraft,  no noise of an engine accelerating rapidly enough to be gone that quickly.  Yet the object was nowhere to be found with no trace of where it went.  It was gone before I could blink right before my very eyes and for the first time in my life I had no clues to lead me to any sort of conclusion. We waited the last few days to see if any other reports surfaced in the news explaining what we saw,  but to no avail.  While I would love to have an alien encounter,  I\u2019m not sure what it was we saw and am not entirely convinced It was a UFO,  I would like to put it out there for anyone who would like to find answers and put all these puzzle pieces together for us and the rest of the confused world.

People do see things they can not explain or identify. But remember the F-117 first flew in 1969. The stealth single wing bomber around the same time. The F-71 Blackbird before that! Please tell me we haven't made any advancement in aircraft in nearly 40 years? I'm fully convinced of UFO's but of our advanced military.

I was around exit 14 when suddenly a seemingly stationary silver, metallic, oval-shaped object caught my eye out of the left side of my peripheral view. I focused on it for what could have been no longer than about 10 to 15 seconds before it suddenly vanished before my very eyes. Before the object in the sky vanished, I started to ask my fianc\u00e9 if she had seen it as well. Before I could finish, she immediately confirmed that she did also. After the first sighting of this object, my fianc\u00e9 and I continued to search the sky in that general area. When about  no more that 20 seconds later, the object seemed to appear in the same direction as before, but it appeared smaller or further away. (I have no way of knowing the distance between the two sightings) This second occurrence seemed to last around 10 to 15 seconds and was again stationary, when it suddenly vanished while I was viewing it. I the fianc\u00e9, of the first reportee was sitting in the passenger seat when out of the left side I witnessed a silver, metallic, oval-shaped object for approximately 10-15 seconds. I saw the object move slightly towards the left and then more so towards the right very briefly, then I saw it vanish. After a few seconds of conversation with my fianc\u00e9 (without eye contact because I was searching for the object in the sky\u2026) I continued to look in that general area in the sky and witnessed the object for a second time after about 20 seconds or so. This time I saw the object of what seemed to be  a further distance, however this time I saw no movement before it vanished and only lasted about 10-15 seconds.

After hangin out and watching t.v. for a while we went to the kitchen to find somethin to eat. While my friend was searching around in the fridge I glanced over at the t.v. which was right next to two big sliding glass doors overlooking a lake. As soon as I looked over I saw a blue orb comming down from the sky towards the house in a kind of \"J\" type descent about 200 yards away. It was traveling at an exceptional fast speed because as soon as I saw it comming down from the sky it was already about 6 feet away from me. It flew through the sliding glass doors as if they werent even there. I was just amazed...I stood there for about 10 seconds as it just hovered about 4 feet off the ground. It was about the size of a basketball and it was bright bright blue around the outside while the inside got progressivly lighter... a very pale blue...almost white.It was pretty much a basketball sized glowing sphere of light. I didnt feel scared, I had a sense of calmness once I snapped out of being completly in awe I slowly walked closer to it until I was about 2 feet away from it. I slowly reached out my hand to touch it for some reason..maybe because I felt that I had to know it was really there. I got about 3 inches from touching it and all of a sudden it went crazy! It started flying around the room in all sorts of directions up, down,  left, right.. at a very high speed. Then before I knew it, it flew back out the sliding glass doors and up into the sky. As soon as it left I turned to my friend and said \"DID YOU SEE  THAT!?\" since he was to busy looking around in the fridge he missed pretty much the whole event except for seeing something light blue fly out of the corner of his eye. Before that I was the type of person that didnt belive until I actually see for myself. Ive looked on the internet for years trying to find out what exactly it was...a spirt/ghost...an alien probe/scout... I have no idea...Ive only been a! ble to f ind a couple of articles that other people have reported on \"The Yukon Report\". For whatever reason I have this feeling that one day I know I'll see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Multi-colored illuminated circular object hovers near and crosses over busy interstate highway. I was traveling southbound on interstate 275 at 17:40 hours to go to a dinner party in St. Petersburg, when I saw 2-3 large and rapid flashes of light that covered the general vicinity of my location. I could not pinpoint the direction of flashes. At first I thought it may be lightening, but I had my moonroof open and I noticed that the cloud cover was broken and scattered at the time and there were no thunderstorms in the area. I thought this was odd, but I quickly disregarded it. The traffic flow on the interstate began banking to the right and heading in a west bound direction. After about 1.5 miles of going westbound, I noticed what appeared to be a commercial jet making a landing approach from over the bay waters, with landing lights. It made its approach over the shoreline in the general area of Bayshore and Hyde Park.  However, I then noticed that it seemed to be taking a long time for this jet to make its approach. I then slowed down and the lights seemed to be at a standstill and hovering  just short of the opposite lanes of the interstate expressway at about 300-feet in altitude and a quarter mile downrange from me. At about this time I then realized that what appeared to be landing lights took on a  rapid \u201ctwinkling\u201d appearance as I closed distance on it. I then reduced my speed even more to get a better look and as I did, it went from a hovering standstill and then quickly \u201cscooted\u201d across all 8 lanes of I-275 in a matter of just a few seco! nds. As the object crossed over the interstate directly in front of me and all oncoming traffic, I then noticed that the entire middle of the object from end to end was illuminated in what seemed to be a grid of yellow, green and blue lights in a rotating pattern.  At this point, I thought It might be a blimp, but as I drove past it, to my dismay, I could clearly see that the lights were rotating around the circumference of a circle. There was no noise or any other anomalies. After it quickly \u201cscooted\u201d across the interstate it then stopped and hovered over an older and darker section of the city with few street lamps and when it did, the colors became very vivid and seemed to pop out visually and become brighter as they rotated rapidly around its circumference. I also noticed that rotational speed of the lights seemed to have varied becoming faster after it passed over my direction on the interstate.  As the object hovered in darkness, it then became apparent to me that this thing was big. I cannot even estimate a size in feet, but visually, It was the size of a nickel held at arms length in your hand.  As I was attempting to make a phone call to my spouse to tell her about what I saw (She has also seen lights of this description in the past), I looked over twice to see if it was still there and it did not move after it crossed the interstate.  Based on the rotation of vivid multicolored lights around its circumference and its ability hover, then! quickly pick up speed and have no noise, I am confident that this was not a regular aircraft.  I am at a loss to figure what it was and I am not sure if the flashes of light I had seen a couple of minutes earlier were linked to what I saw.

We pulled up at a small business plaza and i drop him off at the front of the place.  I continued on to park and found a space a few feet fron the cell phone payment store. As i was waiting for him i was looking around and looked up to my left and saw a white object flying in the sky, at frist i tought it was small business jet plane, but when i looked at the object i realized it did not have a tail or jet engines, i statrted my car and pulled out of my space to a spot where i could see the object better, and saw it was white with a strange glow and had a small set of wings 3/4 of the way to what looked like the end of it. What really startle me then is that it was flying real straight and then all of a sudden it sped up fast and vanished. It was a clear day with blue sky, and i know what a plane looks like, because, in this area i was located at you can see the planes after they take off or when the are begining to decend, because the airport is over 12 miles away. What caught my eye was the fact that this object was flying real low and fast and had no engines and no tail and made no sound, I was hopeing my brother would come out quicker to see what was happening, but by the time he did it was gone. I know some people are going to say it was a military drone or something like that, but i was in the military for almost 14 years and i know what airforce drones all look like. So what i saw was definetly a UFO,  I include some drawings I made of what i saw, let me tell you it realy freak me out, and at first not even my brother belived me, but when he saw i was serious he began to wonder if what i saw was real.",

We were standing in roughly the shape of a triangle.  One of my friends, whose shoulders were almost parallel to the object\u2019s path, got a really puzzled look on his face and pointed toward the sky.  I turned, my shoulders about perpendicular to the path, to see a very bright, light green object about the size of the moon traveling quickly from roughly south to north.  My second friend turned all the way around and saw the bright light travelling quickly behind the clouds. The object was definitely circular, possibly spherical.  It had a tail about twice the length of the object that gradually came to a point.  It was only visible for a second or two due to clouds and trees but I was able to see it cover about 40 to 50 degrees of sky (the angle created by pointing where I first saw it to where it went behind the clouds).  It looked very much like the green ball a Roman candle shoots but without any smoke.  There was no noise except that of the cars on the street and the wind blowing through the trees. I\u2019m not sure what it was.  I grew up by an airport and have seen all different types of planes come in all types of whether at all types of angles and it was definitely not a plane.  I read that green meteorites sometimes occur but if it was, it was either big enough that I\u2019ll be hearing about it on the news tomorrow or close enough that we would have an impact noise at least.  We were standing on church property, which is quite large, so short range fireworks are out of the question.  There is little to no likelihood that it was a big fire work due to the lack of noise and it was the only time we saw anything significant in the sky.",

It was matte gray and almost appeared fluid in its movement.  I thought it might be a weather balloon, but I am not sure a weather balloon would be rectangular.  I thought it might be a slowly falling satellite or something.  The rectangle had one vertical side slightly longer than the other. I am a mother of 4 who was on her way to pick up my 2 daughters from dance class.  I was  really worried as this object appeared to be descending. I was afraid it might fall on the building where my daughters were--although it did appear to be floating down, not actually falling. I can't judge the size of it because I am not sure how far away it was from me.  I only saw one face of the object.  It seemed to be following the path of a fairly busy suburban road, not a main highway.  But I watched it as I drove about 5 miles.   Once it had gotten out of my sight for about a minute and a half.  I do not know where it went, if it was behind trees and buildings or away.",

None more than 75ft from the ground. One was directly in the road and we drove right under it and it didn't move nor did anything happen with us or the truck. 2nd craft was to our right in an open field just hovering the same as the first. A 3rd craft was on the oncoming traffic side of the highway moving away slowly while a 4th was coming towards us but on the opposite side of the highway.. the 5th craft could barely be seen between the trees on the opposite side of the road. All crafts were displaying thousands of multi-colored lights on their underside, flashing at different speeds and no pattern. They seemed to be searching for something... We witnessed them from about 3miles away until we drive under and kept going. I couldn't stop, as my cousin wouldn't let me;  behind us was another car and a semi truck a little further behind. The sighting was in an area where there was no houses or infrastructure only cleared land Manuel for cattle. So I don't know what the town was, but I'm sure we were going through pasco county.

I was driving East across the Courtney Campbell Causeway from Clearwater to Tampa, around 9pm when I noticed one of the street lights looked different because the light was white compared to the yellow street lamps, and much brighter, but relatively the same size. When I looked closer I noticed that it was also higher above the street lights and that it was hovering in the air independently.  At this point I drove past it and could no longer see it, but then ahead of me to the right, over the water I saw something else, at first I could only see reddish lights, but they were not blinking like the lights on a plane. It was also moving much slower, and was much lower than planes fly in that area.  It was moving slowly towards me and then at a certain point it flew across the road, a little ahead of me. It was low enough so that I could see it's shape. It was triangular, with red lights on each point and a white light in the middle. Then it flew out of view.  I don't know if it is important or not, but less than an hour earlier, the causeway had the most awful traffic. I was driving home from work and what usually takes 20 minutes took me two full hours. I only bring this up because I have a feeling that the UFO's are sometimes attracted to our energies, both positive and negative.  This is not the first time I have seen these same crafts. In 2009 I was driving from Tampa to Miami and my friend and we saw these same triangles with the lights on them. One also crossed the road over us and flashed very bright beams of light, which seemed to come from the lights on the corners. Then a few minutes later we saw a bright hovering white light over the road, which looked like a thin metal blimp when we passed under it, and on the other side was a bright red light which hid the metal object.",

It had appeared to be falling from the sky.  Immediately, I'd turned down the music and turned to call my mom so I could make sure she, my son, and my family were okay, worried that it may have been falling towards my house...

I SAW FIRE WORKS IN THE NIGHT SKY. THE SHY WAS PARTLY CLOUDY TOWARDS THE SOUTH SKY AND CLEAR TOWARDS THE NORTH SKY. TOWARDS THE SOUTH SKY I NOTICE A RED LIGHT TRAVELING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ACROSS THE SKY. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FIRE WORK GETTING READY TO EXPLODE, AS ALL THE OTHERS DID. HOWEVER, AS I KEPT MY SIGHT ON THE RED LIGHT, IT DID NOT EXPLODE. INSTEAD THE LIGHT TRAVELED SLOWLY ACROSS THE NIGHT SKY. AS IT FLEW CLOSER I SAW A CRAFT WITH THREE RED LIGHTS THAT WERE NOT FLASHING. AS IT TRAVELED JUST BELOW CLOUD LEVEL, THE LIGHTS LITE UP THE CLOUD ABOVE IT WITH A RED GLOW. I RAN IN THE OFFICE TO GRAB MY BINOCULARS (8X42). WITHIN 30 SECONDS I RETURNED TO MY BACK YARD, THE CRAFT WAS STILL FLYING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY AND WAS STILL UNDER THE CLOUD. SO I STARTED VEIWING IT WITH MY BINOCULARS AND CLEARLY SAW THREE RED LIGHTS, ONE ON THE TOP CENTER, AND ONE ON FRONT AND B! ACK. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO HAVE A GRAY METAL COLOR. ONCE IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER THE CLOUD THE SKY BACKGROUND WAS A CLEAR STAR LITE SKY. THE CRAFT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT 1000 FEET UP IN THE AIR AS IT TRAVELED NORTH A SHORT DISTANCE THEN CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THERE WAS NOT ANY NOISE COMING FROM THE CRAFT. IT STOPPED IN MID AIR FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS. THEN THE CRAFT TOOK OFF FLYING FROM A DEAD STOP, TO A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AT ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST SKY DIRECTION. THE CRAFT TRAVELED SO FAST THAT IT'S RED LIGHTS VANISHED INTO THE STAR LITE SKY IN UNDER 10 SECONDS.",

Tonight while driving Eastbound on I-275 from Clearwater to Tampa, myself, fianc\u00e9 & daughter were in vehicle and I noticed a flashing white & red light descending rapidly in the sky.  First thought it was an airplane or a Chinese lantern, but when it started getting lower thought it was possibly a life flight helicopter.  It descended straight down rapidly at a 45 degree angle, almost like a flare from a flare gun.  It stopped blinking and began pulsating - we tried to slow the vehicle down to take photos but couldn't get a clear shot. There is a large blue water tower on the left side of the highway - between the Ybor City exit and the I-4 interchange - and when we began driving past it I started screaming \"what is it\". It was a flat black and round (as if you'd lay a car tire on its side) with one large round blinking white light on the left, and two large round red lights in the right side. It was near the same size AS the water tower so I was surprised nobody else could see it, it was VERY large.  My daughter began crying and we couldn't find an exit to turn around to look for it.  The craft came straight down, and literally STOPPED beside the water tower, it was hovering beside it.  That's when I started panicking because if it was an airplane, it was close enough to crash into the tower.  It was not a small engine plane as it had NO wings at all. Just a large black round & disc shaped with the 3 lights.  It made absolutely no noise, and when we started passing it, it very rapidly rotated out of sight to the right side, back behind the water tower. About a half hour later, we drove to the roof of the parking garage (5th floor) at the Hard Rock Casino in Tampa to see if maybe we could be high enough to see it or take a picture, but only had cell phones and the video was poor quality.  My fianc\u00e9 stood on the hood of my car and I was just outside the car, and there were two more of the identical craft, approximately 1000 feet away - but these ones were ascending straight up.  Not at an angle at all, not very fast.  The same 1 white light and 2 red ones on each. I have never seen anything like this before in my life, I'm still really shaken at how close they were.",

These lights were more or less in a line stretching  about a fourth of the way across the sky as I watched them slowly move southward.  They were not tightly spaced but had about same space between them: K One........Two.......Three/ Four (these two were one above the other with roughly the same ....... spacing, and seemed to be trying to get closer to each other) then........Five. They must have not been that far away from me because they were quite bright and bigger than stars. I don't know where they came from I just saw them there in that line slowly moving north. At a certain point (which oddly corresponds to where the visibility from my vantage point is unobstructed when  looking at that part of the sky), the light of first object suddenly went dark, and after that when each of those objects reached that part of the sky they too sent dark. It seems that they may have continued on but moving east now ( but I could not be certain).This sighting occurred in Tampa, but in the Temple Terrace/Thontosassa area. These objects moved slowly, and I estimate I watched this for at least three minutes. I wondered if anyone else saw them? As watched it felt almost like they were putting on a show just for me as it took so long. I looked on-line, and it may be possible they were some sort of sky lanterns ( Chinese lanterns) as they are that color and move slowly. I can't be certain. I did not hear of any being launched. But it is a possibility. I always look up at the night sky and have never seen anything like what I saw ever before. However, there was a night  in the  summer  of 2009 in which I saw on roughly that same area of the sky  where the lights went off  in last nights sighting; a strangely churning white cloud ( at night).  I remember because I have NEVER seen a cloud churn and billow so fast.  On that night I got a chill because I was driving home listening to a man tell a story about Moses and the cloud appearing in the mountain, when, as I pulled into my driveway, I saw this strangely churning cloud directly in my line of vision.  It was late at night also and the synchronicity of what I saw  and heard made me run for cover inside my house. So for me, I guess,  that area of sky is indeed mysterious.  I softened wondered if behind that churning cloud was a mother ship.  Odd that the lights should disappear when they got to that part of the sky...",

We are the only ones there.   It's 3 to 3 in the second set, add out and I'm serving from North to South.  I'm serving a second serve.  My service toss is in an area directly above my head as I face West.  I tilt my head up as I look at the area in the sky where I want to toss the ball into.   I look up an toss the ball and stop.  Directly in the area that I'm tossing the ball I see a object every high in the sky reflecting the light from the sun.   I say to my partner look at that and point.  He can't see it.  So I go over to his side of the court next to him and point at the object in the sky.  It's stationary and metallic reflecting the light from the sun, which at 10am is south east.  He sees it and we stare transfixed.  He sees a second similar object higher in the sky that I can't see. The object stayed in this area for around 5 or more minutes and then either left or disappeared.  We just couldn't see it anymore. Cal Dickson Tennis Center is around six miles North of U.S. Central Command MacDill Air Force Base in South Tampa. My partner and I resumed playing tennis and shortly thereafter a military helicopter, (long and silver), appeared in the sky near where the object was that we sighted, but lower.  The helicopter stayed stationary in the sky till around 11am.  And numerous military aircraft with contrails appeared patrolling flying very high in the sky near where the object was sighted.  These aircraft were many times higher in the sky than the helicopter. My partner and I have been playing tennis at the Cal Dickson Tennis Center three times a week on weekday mornings for over two years and are familiar with the aircraft flying over the area.  Tampa International Airport is around five miles northwest of the Cal Dickson Tennis Center. Occasionally, traffic, news and police helicopters appear over the area of the Cal Dickson Tennis Center.  But these helicopters are always east, southeast, northwest over land.  The unidentified flying object we saw was West of us out over the bay.",

      "story": "Odd football shaped object seen from Dale Mabry Highway in Tampa, traveling near airliner. At approximately 2:30, in the afternoon on 05/06/15, I was heading south on Dale Mabry Highway near the Northdale Drive area.  The sky was overcast in patchy sections where there were areas of clear sky between the clouds.  Cloud ceiling looked to be around 6-7000 feet.   I glanced up at an airliner that was making an approach to Tampa Int'l Airport, traveling on a SSW heading.  I estimate the aircraft's altitude at about 3,500-4000 feet.  As I watched the airliner, I spotted another object drop out of the clouds above and slightly in front of the airliner.  The object was shaped like a football with the ends more narrowly pinched together.  It was uniformly gray in color.   It described a smooth arc downward for maybe 500' or so, then pulled up and into the next cloud bank.  The sighting lasted only a few seconds, but the object was clearly visible, and I could see the airplane and the object together.  I would estimate the object to be slightly smaller than the airliner so perhaps 100' long.  It had no wings, engines or other visible characteristics or marking.   Its movement was very smooth and fluid.  I'm not sure if anyone on the aircraft was in a position to see the object as it was almost directly above them and perhaps 1000-2000 feet higher.   When the object ducked back into the clouds, I continued driving south in hopes I might see it again but it did not reappear.  Not sure what it was but very unusual looking and appeared to be controlled.  It was moving slightly faster than the aircraft so maybe around 200-250 knots.   I am something of an aviation buff but this did not resemble any aircraft that I know of.",

Looking south, over what would be the Wal-Mart area near Gunn Highway, we thought what a very bright red star.  Amazing to see such a close bright vibrant red star, and somewhat next to it was a red star nearly as bright and also seemingly closer to the Earth too.  Then the brighter of the two just started rising high up into the sky.  Once it got extremely high it would seem like just another hard to see star.  It would flash a time or two and then disappear.  Then the other star next to it moved off to left of it in a westerly direction, and slowly started to move high up into the sky just as the first one did, and then it did the same thing.  It just blinked out.  As soon as it did, another very bright red star popped into existence low into the sky and just sat there, still, not moving.  After about 5-10 seconds, it repeated what it had done before, just as it would be ready to blink out from being seen (it would reach a high level in the sky and then stop; and then vanish from being seen), there would appear a super vibrant red light down low in the sky and this pattern repeated again and again for 3-4 cycles.  We stopped to watch this in complete awe, and then after watching it for 5 minutes, it all just stopped.  About 3 minutes later, 2 very bright red lights/sphere just appeared high in the sky, but relatively low (like when the GoodYear Blimp is very high up, but comparatively low in relation to clouds/stars).  We had a great look at the brilliance of these two relatively close red lights, but then honestly we became a little nervous.  It was just me, the wife, and the dog.  I am a lawyer.  These stories about visits and encounters always seem to end poorly for humans, and it was uncharacteristically quiet for our apartment complex in terms of there being little people traffic/movement at 1am on a Saturday night.",

The object proceeded to move in quick diagonal directions quickly then flash again every 20-30 seconds or so.  I watched it move up down side to side at angles not made by any aircraft I know of.   There was no sound,  It would also come to a quick stand still then zip off again.  I have never seen anything like it.   Btw, I just had my vision checked a month ago and it's 20/20.

      "story": "Unexplained Lights in Night Sky North of Tampa. My wife and I were walking through the parking lot of the Pepin Center in Tampa, Florida, when I pointed out to her two lights in the north-northeast sky at approximately 20 degrees from the horizon. They were about the size and intensity of brightness as Sirius.  They were a thumb's distance apart and stationary. I pointed out to my wife that I didn't know of any constellation with stars that bright in the north sky in the Tampa area at this or any other time of the year.  After about a minute, the two stationary lights dimmed and then disappeared. Thoroughly perplexed as to what these were - - they were not satellites, meteorites, rockets/missiles,or aircraft landing lights.  Their altitude and actual size was impossible to determine. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Good evening Mr. Davenport: It's an honor to hear from you! I am very familiar with the landing lights of all manner of aircraft. I am both an aviation and astronomy buff and am well acquainted with both spheres of study. Within moments after this sighting, I did see a commercial airliner (by engine sound and configuration of landing and navigation lights, likely an Airbus A-319 or A-320 series or a Boeing 737) at about 5,000' AGL commencing a downwind (heading south for a north landing on Runway 35R) approach to Tampa International Airport(KTPA). That aircraft was due west when I spotted it - - I did wonder if anyone in it on its port side might have seen these two lights, but I suspect the lights were possibly too high and too far north to be seen in the field of vision of those in the cabin  - - I would love to know if someone did and was thinking that then!). The color of these lights was not typical of the landing lights of any aircraft that I have seen - - they were the same color, hue and intensity of self illuminated stars or reflective sunlight on satellites.  Although aircraft landing lights can and will often appear stationary, based on distance from, and the heading of, aircraft, such light inevitably moves or grows in intensity as it heads toward you.  Landing lights are seen either coming toward you or from the side, but would not be seen heading heading away from you.   My initial thought after knowing that these lights were not a normal part of the night sky for this part of the year was that they were satellites - - the major problem being that both of them did not move for several minutes but remained stationary.  Their fade out took about 5 seconds and was gradual and simultaneous - - both my wife and I were flummoxed by what we saw. If you have any other questions, please feel free to e-mail or call me at ((END ADDENDUM))",

My address is Tampa, but I am actually in Northdale about 8 miles North of Tampa. At 7:49 PM, I walked into my office on the 3rd floor of my apartment building to get my keys.  The light was off and I noticed something outside of my plate glass window. Looking due East, I saw a bright red/orange light coming towards me from the horizon.  I got my cell phone out and videotaped it for the next 2 minutes and 20 seconds.  The fiery look settled down and I noticed it was a round orange globe, too big to be a planet, and too small to be the moon.   The skies were crystal clear.  It flashed orange lights a few times and then stayed white and seemed to be further away.  It drifted slowly to the south and stayed fixed for a minute or so.  Then it began drifting to the south more noticeably and stopped again.  After another minute or so, it simply disappeared.

      "story": "Very bright disk light object at a dead stop in the sky signals then zooms away. On Sunday March 11th, 2018, a fairly bright light hovering in the sky caught my attention.  Upon further inspection, I can make out a disk shape in the sky basically parked in place. I'm always looking up hoping to see UFO's but I'm a semi-skeptical person.  So I stare at if for a while.  My little brother is fairly close to me, he follows my gaze and then rolls his eyes and says \"Izzy relax, its probably just a plane.\"  To which I respond, \"No David, look.  See behind that thing?  Moving slowly with the light? THATS a plane\" and I point at a plane clearly visible much much farther BEHIND the object, moving slowly, and clearly identifiable by its blinking red navigation light. This proved two things.  The object was definitely parked in place, and it was not an ordinary aircraft because although the sun has set at 7:36, it was around 7:45 at the time and it was still bright out.  NOT bright enough for a normal aircraft to have its \"brights\" on.   The airplane cruising in the far distance only had a faint plane-shaped figure with no other lights on other than its red blinking navigation lights.  We both agree that this is weird, and as he continues to go on with his business (he was washing our mothers vehicle at the time of the incident). I decide to take out my phone and take a video of it. At this moment two things begin to happen.  My mother comes out of her adobe and I point at the UFO and tell her \"mom look, it has NOT moved\" and as I say those words I notice that there has been a change in the object.  The previously bright shining constant light emitted from the bottom of the aircraft has turned into a single light circling around and around the base of the aircraft.  After a few cycles, the light sequence changes yet again, but this time it does a sequential light signal pointing in the direction it is about to zoom to.  After five sequences it zooms at an impossible speed silently. Video can be seen here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IIMh0mU6eI",

It was quite eerie, as it was a very unusual and intense color of red for it to be a jet aircraft on a landing approach to either Tampa International Airport or nearby MacDill AFB illuminating a bunch of clouds with its landing lights.  I have seen many normal aircraft fly through the clouds but never a color or shape like this.   The object appeared as a red glowing cigar shape for about 7 seconds, and then instantly changed shape to a much smaller but very intense bright white circular shaped object or light as it continued to fly in a northerly direction for about another 30 seconds.  I could see that the object had changed to a pulsing reddish orange glow as it flew away.  I never observed any typical red or green aircraft navigation strobe lights.   I was able to get several pictures of it from my cell phone, but unfortunately, not quickly enough to capture an image in the bright red cigar shape portion of the sighting.   There was never any sound of aircraft engines and there were no NASA rocket launches that evening at Cape Kennedy.  The entire sighting was about 45 seconds.

My mom could see my face as I thought in my head \"If that thing starts moving, I am OUTTA HERE\" sure enough as my mom turns around slowly in horror it now starts heading our way. recorded a video and dialogue between my mom and I as well as the craft is captured. craft was a compilation of 7 small lights bundled closely together. craft almost 'waited' for my mom to turn around as well before it started its dance. it would quickly maneuver 3 different directions impossibly before going completely invisible and showing up miles or a mile from last seen area. it did this maybe 5 or 6 times IN 5 or 6 seconds. Moved so quickly even my mother kept saying Why?? lights were pink on outside edges with violet or purple for the inside! 5 lights. its movements defied conventional physics, Newtonian forces would have destroyed anything else attempting that. As scared as i was, i did not want my mom to run inside without me. I explained to my mother that this craft is the united states navy x-37 - using mass reduction drive together with piezoelectric superconducting material (ultrasonic vibrations causing noble gas to ionize) she understandably didn't know what the hell i was talking about. I explained 'Ok, its meant to refill combat planes on the field, needing those movements and maneuvers not just to get around but to evade incoming fire . craft was with us for around 5 minutes now appearing overhead and a mile away in the same second. finally in the video (video shows craft as 1 blurry purple ball) I say 'Oh i think i can hear it, sounds exactly like an airplane' because craft was completely silent the entire time, as i said that i could see a regular commercial airline start to come around from the to! ps of houses. As soon as that happened, this craft became ...e! mbarrass ed? it stopped moving crazy and put itself on a straight trajectory, accelerating instantly but not going too insanely fast it b-lined until it went below horizon. my mother wouldn't go to sleep unless she found something similar online. which she did amazingly, and only based on the movements it was doing in the video were exactly the same speed and velocity as we saw. by 4 am my mother finally went to sleep content with what she saw online and in person that night. still confused, but happy someone else had filmed it.

While looking at that star we noticed another bright light that looked the same but it was moving slowly like a plane. Then we noticed what we first thought was a giant bird.  It was gliding closer to us in a perfectly straight path. It was about three storys above us from what we could guess. As it approached it almost looked like a giant ufo dish shaped cloud. We would have thought it was a cloud if it wasn't perfectly disk shaped and gliding slowly over us but much faster than the clouds.  It looked like what you think of when you think traditional ufo dish. The only difference was that it was that shape but it seemed like it was cloaked to try to hide. We never would have saw it if we weren't looking at the sky because it was so faint.",
