      "story": "orange light drips in LONG BEACH CA i live on the second floor so i have a pretty good veiw of the sky.i live near the long beach airport and see planes fly by from there and LAX and sometimes the police helicopters. well anyway, iwent out to smoke about 11:15 pm i took a few drags and noticed an orange light coming from the north and i thought it was weird cause it didnt have any safty flashers on it and it didnt make any noise!at first it just looked like a round light in the sky but as it got closer it looked like an oval saucer type of light.i didnt want to say it was a UFO right away but when i saw it drip  thats when i knew some thing wasnt right! it dripped twice.it looked like it was goning to drip again but the drip paused right under it so it looked like two lights. right after that it switched directions it started to move west at a slower speed, so i ran in the house and got my girlfriend, by the time we got out there it looked the same as when i first saw it but not so clear cause it went through a thin cloud and i shouted in exicitement \"do you see it,do you see it\"she said \"yeah but it s just an orange light.\" i said \"can you hear it?\" she said \"no.\" i showed her my goose bumps and we went in the house. i told her the whole story.5 min later a helicopter flew by, 20 min after that a second flew by. i dont know if its because of the UFO though. i know i couldnt  have been the only one that saw it!!!

      "story": "9/17/1960 -21:10 hours-Terminal Island, Califronia, Four  Crescent over LBNSY- observed 4-5 seconds above broken clouds I was working the Swing Shift as a shipfitter at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard.  At lunch time (20:30 hours) most of us shipfitters and welders would go to our main shop (Building 128) for lunch, card playing, naps or whatever we could do in only half an hour. This was the week after Echo I had been launched and was scheduled to be visible over the Los Angeles area.  I think it was Tuesday the 16th when lunch ended and one of the welders called for us out to the front (South side) of the shop to watch Echo I pass overhead.  It was a very clear night and was easily seen as a silver dot (about the size of a pencil lead held at arm's length).  It's orbit from West to East was easily tracked and we all felt thankful to have had an opportunity to see it on one of the few nights it would be seen in our area. The next night there were scattered clouds and as I left the shop building after lunch and walked toward Dry Dock 2 I looked up at the clouds and thought to myself, \"Much too cloudy to see Echo tonight\". Then from above the clouds on a Southerly course I saw four crescent shaped objects \"flying\" in a reverse \"V\" formation.  Being crescent shaped and not too long after sunset I first surmised it was the sun (now over our horizon) that was reflecting off of some type of aircraft like the Vought V-173 \"Flying Pancake\".  I could only see them for about 4 or 5 seconds before they disappeared above another cloud.  I tried to listen for a sound of aircraft engines but heard nothing except for the leaking air from low pressure air manifolds down in the Dry Dock.  If they were the Vought aircraft, I would certainly have heard their twin propeller engines. I checked my glasses for dust, backed up and stepped forward again to see if they were a reflection of something on the ground off my glasses.  I did this for one or two minutes without being able to duplicate the apparent sighting.  In size, and if circular or \"saucer\" shaped with the reflecting sun on their West edges, they would be the size of a pencil eraser held at arm's length (as opposed to a pencil lead in my description of Echo I). When I mentioned this to a couple of my fellow workers they just laughed and said I've been reading too many Science Fiction books (actually I was reading Harold Lamb's historical novels at that time). I have modified an historical map of the shipyard (that no longer exists) that I reconstructed from old maps and aerial photos for a book I am writing on the history of the Shipyard, Naval Base and attached Naval Air Station.  In accordance with your instructions of electronically uploading images, I am emailing this map both as an insert and as an attachment for your study. Because I transferred over to the Design Division 4 years later and eventually was the structural configuration manager of the 1980's reactivation of the Iowa Class Battleships I kept the story to myself - except with friends who like stories like that.  I retired in 1994 but did not decide to file an official report until now when I realized the accuracy of my shipyard map may be of value.",

It was not a plane, helicopter, blimp, or kite, or anything that I have ever seen before. As I was sitting there thinking what the heck was that, along came another one much closer about 2,000 ft. up and on the same path going southeast as the first one.

It looked like it flew into a black piece of felt and there was no trace of light anywhere it was just gone.  We were the only car on the road at that time and all of the street lights on the highway were out which we thought was quite odd.

You can see my report filed on 11-12-06.  Earlier today whole playing baseball I saw an f-15 jet fly pretty low over Long Beach.  I had a feeling something was up.  I had a feeling the last thing I saw was military.  Around 6pm I went out on the balcony to get some fresh air.  I noticed the normal air traffic coming and going near LAX.  I then saw these red lights flashing unlike the other planes.  I called my roommate to take a look and he also agreed that it was not an airplane.  We saw a group of lights moving about the speed of an airplane moving in a NW direction.  It seemed like it was flying along the coastline.  The lights would flash in random intervals. There where no other lights but about 4 red lights.  It could have been one craft, the lights moved as if it where one.  The size would have been huge, maybe miles wide! It was about as wide a 4 finger width, if you put your hand in front of you. We saw this thing continue north and finally disappeared in the horizon.  I went inside for a few minutes.  When I cam back out it had come back a bit like it turned around but was heading in he same direction again.  The lights would flash in random order.  It seems there where two on the outside and two closer to the middle.  The light flash was very bright and precise. These were not normal lights.  I would also guess the craft was in a v shape bcuase of the way the lights moved. I kept looking in the sky after it had gone.  I noticed some flashing lights again but this time it seems like an airplane.  I thought it could have been a military jet because the way the lights flashed where different than the other airplanes.  Later I saw a bright light approaching outside of the normal flight path.  Then the light turned off and I saw the same type of airplane lights that I saw after the red lights passed by.  I really think this was a military jet escorting ! or looki ng fir the craft.  This is my second sighting of something strange in the sky within 2 weeks.  I have never seen anything strange before in my life.  I am college educated.  I also have really good eyesight.  I am glad my roommate was there.   I think he finally believed me about the thing I saw earlier in the week.  It seems like there has been a lot of activity going on in the LA area recently.

      "story": "Let me first say that I have been a pilot since I was 17 years old, flew helicopters in the Army and logged over 3600 hours of flight time.  I have very good depth perception and can judge altitudes pretty accurately.  This particular incident is the second unexplained sighting I have had in 40 plus years.  My 2 children, 12 and 8 years old, and I were sitting on a grassy knoll in a local park watching radio controlled gliders.  I heard an approaching airplane and layed on my back to looked up at the sky to watch the plane begin its' landing approach to the local airport.   As it passed overhead I noticed a small round, very bright, solid white object at a very high altitude, directly above me.  It was slowly moving westward when it stopped.  When this happened, I asked my 12 year old if she could see the object.  She said she did and asked what it was.   I then asked my 8 year old if he could see it.  After 5 seconds or so, he also saw it.  Just as my 8 year old spotted the object, it slowly started to move in a north direction for maybe 10 seconds, then stopped.  Within a few more seconds, it changed direction and moved south east to a spot directly over us again.  The white round object had completed a triangle pattern.  After about 3 or 4 minutes, we saw the object seem to tilt down towards the east and it now appeared to have a faint outline of chrome or silver to it.  It stayed like this for only 3 or 4 seconds, then appeared to rotate back up to its' original horizontal (?) position.  This day was fairly windy - 10-15 mph surface winds with a much faster high altitude wind due to a cold front system moving in.  The white object never gained altitude or drifted in any direction other than the original 3 directions mentioned. My estimate was that it was at or above 40k feet as there were 2 high altitude jets passing through the area that created vapor trails and the white object appeared at this altitude or higher.  My children and I watched this object for over five minutes - I had checked my watch.",

I was on the phone with my girlfriend as I watched what I originally thought was a plane \u201cpulsate\u201d its front lights as it flew in the direction of the ocean. As I got closer I realized that the object was not in fact moving but hovering just over the path of the freeway.  Immediately I realized that I was not looking an airplane (due to the absence of the blue and red lights normally seen on the wings of the plane) and as the objects came into view I was able to make out three distinct lights forming a perfect triangle. The entire time I was just saying, \u201cOh my God, oh my God, what am I looking at?!\u201d  This continued for about 3 minutes until the freeway began to bend in another direction of the lights, and at this point the other two lights began to pulsate in unison. I watched this go on as I made the left bend on the freeway, and the last I could see of the lights is that they began to change colors to a deep blue.  I did not stop because I was honestly too afraid to and still am shaken up by the whole experience.  Other then myself I do not know the other observers because we were all on the freeway, I do know that others did notice the lights because traffic was beginning to slow down and people next to me were pointing.

At high altitude was a small round object. It was so high as to be difficult to say if it had any shape other than round, or any distinguishing markings. A high flying airliner was nearby and was below this object which in my estimation had to make the object we saw at least as large as the passenger jet. The object was moving in a strange sort of s-pattern, changing directions a number of times in a short distance. Next it seemed to go straight up, as it became suddenly smaller and then disappeared. We observed the object for less than one minute. Neither of us had ever seen anything in the sky behave in this manner before.

Some were in formations other were not.  There would be bursts of speed then very slow as if trying to pass for stars should anyone look up.  I had to ask others there if they were seeing what i was seeing and like me the first explanation was that they were planes, but the altitude was too high and their light to bright for anything conventional and the speed to great, not to mention the size they must have been to cast such a light at that altitude.  After they passed there was a brief period where the sky was just black then the stars! were all there in their normal  locations I stood there in disbelief while other said to call the police or someone.

From my position I estimated it was pretty high, as the Long Beach air traffic was flying well below it.  Yet for ten minutes it did not move, so I ruled out balloon and blimp.  I tried to record it with my video camera, but the reflectivity of the object and the distance of it made recording impossible, it simply wasn't registering in my view finder...  As I put my camera down it began moving slowly toward Seal Beach (Naval Weapons Station) direction.  By 16:15 pst it was out of my visual range.  There was only one object. My background is irrelevant to the sighting.  I am not ex-military or law enforcement, and I have only seen a UFO one other time, with two friends in 1994.

I wasn\u2019t the only person to see it.  There were 8 cars around me that all hit the brakes at the same time as me when I saw it.  I thought maybe it was a plane or a jet since there is an airport and an air force base near by but I\u2019ve never seen a commercial jet fly so fast or a military jet vanish.",

First, let me say that I have seen this type of incident many times in my life, but this is the first time I am reporting it. I got up at approx. 4 am, because of a bad dream.   I walked into my living room which is all glass, and the night sky was exceptionally clear, no clouds.  In between some palm fronds I noticed something that was EXTREMELY bright, like a planet, but upon further inspection, I noticed it had a somewhat strange shape, somewhat of a triangle, with a larger flat top and pointed bottom.  It seemed to be \" pulsing\" bright, dimmer,brighter, dimmer, AND was moving in a jerky side to side motion, while very slowly moving upward, I lined my head up with the wall of the sliding glass door to make sure I wasn't moving and I watched this thing making a weird, loopy motion, sort of wobbling here and there, but always slowly moving upwards, while it still kept getting VERY bright, then dimming, and getting bright, over and over.  I know it wasn't a plane, or a helicopter, or a satellite, or a star, etc........ and as I said, I have seen this same type of \" star like\" object, ( MANY times through my life from the time I was a teenager, and I am now 56) that if you were to just glance at it, would seem like a planet or star, but if you start to stare at it, you notice it is doing very bizarre things, just subtlely, as you study it. I once observed an object like this on a beach in Oxnard, Calif. at 5 am. which was just above the horizon of the ocean.  Some surfers were in the ocean, and the sun was just barely starting to come up.  The object went directly into the ocean !!!!!   I was STUNNED, and apparently the surfers were too because they started yelling and screaming and going wild !!!! We had all witnessed something of the most bizarre nature, not knowing what to think.   I witnessed the object I am reporting now, for about 30-40 min. before I noticed it started waning in intensity, and it just \" went out\" and vanished in a perfectly clear night sky............

      "story": "UFO seen in Long Beach California; Air traffic rerouted, helicopters search and no word in the media! From 7:59 to 8:25pm on March 17th, 2009, (please excuse my ignorance in forgetting to reset the time in my camera for DST!) my sons and I saw another UFO in the skies over Long Beach, California.  We were in the backyard of our home taking pictures of whatever might look interesting, as sky-watching is our hobby.  We do it at least 5 days a week to relax after a long day and I've been teaching them the constellations.   I then noticed something that didn't fit what we've come to know as a terrestrial craft, whether a jet, prop or experimental aircraft.  There was an object that was going from the west to the east and there was no red light visible (FAA REG) as with ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT taking off from the airport. Then it started to hover and immediately changed direction and again... did not have the FAA green light on its opposite side. I have almost 60 photos of this sighting... you really must see them all to be able to appreciate what is going on here. From my vantage point of about a mile off of the Pacific coast, this craft was hovering on the southern horizon - probably above the electric company at the corner of Studebaker and 2nd Street/Westminster.  After hovering, the craft would then make 160-180 degree turns going east, then west, then repeating while slowly drifting further south - over the Pacific Ocean - towards the famed \"Redondo Trench\".  This went on, as can be seen in the properties of my photos, for 26 full minutes. At the time of our sighting this time, it was not clear what shape the object actually was until the photos were analyzed upon download to my computer, and even then, it seemed only the lights were visible.  As far as structure and the apparent \"shape-shifting abilities\", this was one spectacular sighting! However it didn't beat the Triangle \"Mothership\" we all saw last November 12th, and I don't think anything else could!  That was reported the same day on UFO NorthWest, if you are interested. Anyway, I took a few \"real-time\" photos of the craft, but didn't want to \"waste\" the pictures and knew the only way to be sure to \"get proof\" was to take timed shots, so - as a result - most of the almost 60 photos I shot were 8 second exposures at a F 2.5 setting with an exposure value at +2.00 (the highest my camera goes) and certainly showing the true colors of the crafts lights and its flight pattern/path.  I used a high-pixel, Sony Cybershot digital camera and did not alter the originals AT ALL! I have kept their integrity to help you to prove or disprove whatever it was that caused more than ten helicopters to be in the air after it disappeared, and caused them to refuel and return to the search for the next 2 hours or so.  The light appeared to be of whitish/yellow color with a bit of red from time to time, and what got my attention was that the lights and colors did not match the FAA regulations with regards to Red on the left and green on the right and white lights that blink 40x per minute.  This thing pulsed and then stayed lit.  Then it blinked white lights fast and then went back to pulsing again only to follow it with another blast of bright, solid light for another thirty to sixty seconds.  From where I was, it looked like a saucer, then looked like 2 doing maneuvers together.  Then it looked like two orbs that were connected somehow, then \"shape-shifting\" into something else... more square-round. I would also like to mention that based on the photos I have taken, I have reason to believe their may have been more than one craft in the sky last night, too.  Several shots seem to show what could be mistaken for stars, but upon closer inspection, can be seen to have the same color coding/ shading as the inital craft and in two of my photos, it looks as if their are 2 saucers of another shape that might even be a couple of boomerangs, but on a timed photo, it is hard to tell. You are the experts and I do hope that my final disclosure to you will help figure out what is happening on our planet! Well, this was absolutely incredible, but did not come close to others I and my family have had and would like to talk with an investigator about. Last night, there were a total of 7 of us and an 8th joined in at the last minute, that witnessed this sighting and the after-effects. Only three of us saw it for the first 20 minutes or so, because I was getting pictures while the boys watched and tried to get neighbors out to see it, too. What else is interesting is that on March 11th, 2009, there was little to no usual traffic going into or out of Long Beach Airport and around 8:18pm, seven military and police/civilian helicopters flew over our house, seeming to be looking for something on the ground. They flew rather slowly, from west to east and then took a more southerly direction when above Seal Beach, moving towards the Huntington Beach Area. Scary thing? I took photos of them, too as soon as I heard them coming and watched them go... and the first shot set off the flash which seemingly caused one of the helicopters to turn on and shine a searchlight on us! I had the kids shut off the lights in and outside of the house, got to my computer and downloaded them as soon as I could - just in case I got something I wasn't supposed to have! I would most certainly like to speak with an investigator, especially since I've had multiple sightings (as has my eldest son) over the last many years and would like to finally share some of them with anyone willing to listen. I am beginning to fear whatever the heck is going on... and there IS something going on. Especially here in Long Beach, California.",

At approximately 12:50 AM, I and four friends were standing outside and witnessed a flash of neon-green light which brightly lit the entire sky. I was looking in the direction that the flash appeared to originate from, in the southwest portion of the sky near Douglas Park, (a new commercial and housing development near the Long Beach Airport) and saw a vibrant but undiscernible arc or point of green light low in the sky, slightly above the rooftop level of a house across the street. One friend of mine, who was facing the other direction, also saw the flash but observed that it lower in intensity and appeared to have come from behind him. Several friends of mine living in an area in the general direction of the flash--in the Lakewood Country Club--reported having lost power at the time, several minutes later via facebook. The flash event lasted only a brief second, and neither I nor my companions heard any sort of noise in the seconds following the anomaly. I suspect that the flash was caused by a copper or thallium-containing iron meteorite, which would explain the green color of the flash, the lack of accompanying sound, and EMP which knocked out power.  I am an entering college student with an above-average scientific background.  I wrote this report to provide a coherent, detailed explanation of the event that occurred in anticipation that other reports would be made.",

I was awaken by my child's baby monitor going absolutely berserk like we've never heard it before. The way I sleep in bed I face our bedroom window( we only have one) which is covered with a thin piece of fabric. I was so tired, so I just opened my eyes to stare out the window when I noticed to BRIGHT( throbbing) lights about the size of a grapefruit at the base of our window. I lay still to make sure I saw what I just thought I saw, then the lights \"throbbed\" or pulsated again. Me being a skeptic, immediately thought that it was an intruder on the side of our house. I immediately sat up and sat STILL waiting to perhaps see the shadow of a human pass by.   I then got up to check on my toddler who was fast asleep.  I dare not look out the window, in fact it was like the event didn't even happen because I acted like I didn't see what I just saw. I tried to go back to sleep but felt CHARGED as if I had 10 cups of espresso.   Later that! day in Long Beach, we had a small earthquake too.  I felt it because I was laying in the bed, if fact the earthquake centered in Signal Hill, which is just 4 blocks north of where we live ( not sure if it's related) the earthquake was a 3.2 if I remember correctly.  Anyhow, when my husband came home from work, and started running errands together, I finally brought it up about these two strange lights outside our window, come to find out he saw them too!  But he was trying to rationalize what he saw as well. At the time I saw the lights and thought it was an intruder I completely forgot about the motion sensor that would have come on if it had been a person or animal.  The sensor didn't go off. I am so spooked. I don't think I'll ever sleep the same again.  I have feelings of dread going to bed now.  My nerves are frayed every time the baby monitor experiences even a little static.   Now I see why people remain quiet or go crazy or commit suicide or something, the range of emotions are over whelming.  I have NEVER had any interest/beliefs in ! extra terrestrial phenomenon nor have I ever wanted to see ANYTHING.   I'd probably be dead if I had see a space craft or actually alien...",

If you view this direction with Google Maps Street View, you see the power lines going above the apartments, garages and alley \u2013 the object we saw was hovering above the highest power line. DESCRIPTION My daughter and granddaughter had gone out my building\u2019s back door into the alley and called my phone to come out and look. It looked like a burning object, and I thought maybe it was an aircraft or a meteor, but it did not appear to be moving and there was no contrail. Then we saw a big burning piece fall straight down from the main object. This piece was smaller than the main object, left a trail of sparks and embers, and seemed to burn out and disappear before it traveled a quarter of the way from the object toward earth. This happened two or three more times, additional chunks falling in similar fashion from the main object while the main object continued to burn brightly - I say \u201cburn\u201d because it seemed to change shape and flare the way a fire does, and it was bright reddish orange and yellow like flames. DURATION This went on for 2-5 minutes (it is difficult to estimate the time since we were so stunned by this \u2013 it was unlike anything we\u2019d ever seen before), and then the main object\u2019s \u201cflame\u201d seemed to suddenly go out, although we could still see the object, now looking like a very dim star. The dim spot remained stationery for another 30 seconds to a minute, then started very slowly moving downward. As it got below (from our vantage point) the highest power line, it appeared to start moving south as it also gradually sank lower \u2013 the southward motion seemed faster than the downward motion and we lost sight of it after 2-5 minutes when the building across the alley (east) from us blocked our view.",

      "story": "Big, extremely bright, bluish-white, silent light that changed shape in the sky over the ocean in Long Beach, CA. I saw something unusual in the sky while letting my dog out to urinate at 5:00 in the morning on September 29, 2011.  I was the only person in my house to see it see it, but I am reporting it in hopes that maybe someone else saw it too and can corroborate what I saw. Because I was a bit afraid of what I saw, I did take a picture. I just rushed my dog back in the house, locked my door, and got back in to bed close to my spouse. In retrospect I wish I would have taken a picture so that I would have some proof of what I saw, but the thing really creeped me out and I did not want to even look at it again. I live across the street from the beach. From my front yard, looking southwest, there was a big, bright light in the sky. The sky was very clear and the morning was very quiet.  The light I saw is the brightest thing I have ever seen, except for the sun. It was so bright and seemed to be bluish-white in color. It was brighter than the moon. I don\u2019t think that it was as bright as the sun because it did not hurt my eyes to look at it. It wasn\u2019t a glowing light and it wasn\u2019t blurry, just clear and bright white light. The light did not move and distance or make any noise at all. The shape of the light was like a vertically-oriented oval. At one point the light shifted from being an oval shape to being a crescent shape and then back again to an oval or round shape. It appeared to be very large in the sky. From the ground it did not look as big as the moon, but it looked way bigger than stars or planes look. Because the light seems strange to me, I started trying to figure out what it was. I know that is was not the moon because it was too bright and didn\u2019t have that glowing, reflective quality of the moon.  It also did not have any of the man-on-the- moon shapes on it.  It was just a solid bright light. I know it was not a helicopter because it did not make any noise or have to typical little lights that helicopters have. I know it was not a plane because it did not move or go anywhere.  I know it was not a street light because the lights in my neighborhood are orange colored and this was much higher. I know it was not a meteor because it did not move.  I know it was not a star because it was too big and because there is usually too much light pollution in Long Beach to really see starts clearly. I know it wasn\u2019t a planet because it was too big.  I also know that I was not dreaming this because I stayed awake after putting my dog out.  I know it was not a blimp because it was vertic! ally oriented and did not move. I of course know it was not a bird because it was a bright light. I know it was not a flare because flares fall and leave a smoke trail that you can see in the dark.  I know it was not a firework, because it did not fall of make noise. And I know it was not a spotlight or lighthouse light because it was far too bright.  I know it was not from a boar because it was too high up in the sky.  I know it was not a light on a tall building because there are not any tall buildings over the ocean. Maybe this was a piece of the NASA space shuttle still falling down? I don't know.",

      "story": "5 dull red lights in V formation cruising over the coast of Long Beach I have been thinking about this for years and, due to some recent TV shows, I have decided I should report what I saw. The event occurred in either 1980 or 1981.  It has been so long ago I don't really remember.  I do know where I was living at that particular time so that is how I got the year.  I was also in the presence of a friend when the event occurred. It was sometime around the winter of 1980/81.  I was living in Belmont Shores California.  The evening was cold and very clear with an unusual amount of starts out.  A friend of mine and I decided to walk a couple of blocks down to the beach to look at the stars.  I'm not sure how long we were there when we saw the object. I first notice the lights in the South West.  The beach we were at faces South.  The object was actually 5 lights; I think.  They were in the formation of a gigantic \"V\".   My friend and I watched until we lost it in the bright lights of the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.   We did not observe any type of body associated with the lights.  As we were watching we were screaming out for others to see but no one was around.  It must have been 10-15 seconds we watched.  I distinctly remember saying it wasn't making any noise because we could see commercial airplanes high up and hear their engines.  The lights were moving much faster than the aircraft but no noise and it seemed it was just lights.   What was really weird at the time is that the lights did not shine.  I never knew how to explain it but now I think they might have been like a LED light similar to the red ones indicating an electrical device is on. The only reason I am writing now is because I have recently seen a couple of UFO shows where people have seen the same thing we did.  The only difference is that we could not make out any shape or object and could only see the 5 lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Bright green light over north Long Beach CA. On Friday August 5, 2011, at approximately 10:15pm, my girlfriend and I were walking to our car after having dinner at ((name deleted)) Restaurant in Long Beach (XXXXX) East 2nd Street, Long Beach, CA 90803-5308)  As we were walking across the parking lot I noticed a bright green light moving in the sky. I thought it was a skyrocket at first so I kept looking at it, waiting for it to explode.  I was facing northeast. My girlfriend was right behind me but was fumbling with her purse, looking either for her phone or for cigarettes.  I can't remember which. Fireworks are a common sight during the summer in Southern California, and I thought this was part of a fireworks show being put on by an amusement park or maybe even the Orange County Fair.  But there was no explosion.  The bright green light appeared to just hover over North Long Beach. I should note that we were a few blocks from a south facing beach and that we were walking in an eastward direction through the parking lot.  The lights we saw did not appear directly above us but rather appeared about five or maybe even ten miles northeast of our location. The distance itself is a bit of a guess.  It was a clear night but I didn't notice any type of landmark that would help to determine how close or how far the lights really were, though it's possible that they were near the Long Beach Airport, as it is in the general direction of where we saw the lights. My girlfriend hadn\u2019t noticed it yet so I asked her, \"Hey, what is that?\"   I pointed to the green light that I\u2019d been observing and she thought it was a plane, but I pointed out to her that it couldn\u2019t be a plane or helicopter because there were no blinking lights on this object.  It remained one solid color throughout the entire sighting, bright green. As we were watching this thing we could see that the normal air traffic one sees every night was still happening.  There were helicopters in the distance and we could see planes in the sky, probably making their way to Long Beach Airport or LAX. The other thing we noticed was that the green light was the brightest light in the sky at that time. We watched it move back and forth (east to west then back again) for a few minutes. It\u2019s difficult to say how fast it was moving but I would say its speed seemed similar to that of a commercial airliner moving across the horizon. Approximately two minutes into the sighting we noticed a second bright green light appear below the first green light.  This light appeared to be west of the original light we\u2019d spotted.  We didn\u2019t notice any movement with the second light.  It appeared to just be hovering in the sky. The second light appeared in the sky for about thirty seconds and then vanished. After the second light had vanished we noticed a third light appear below the original bright green one.  This light was east of the green light and was red in color. This third light\u2019s movement was similar to that of a helicopter.  I actually thought it was a helicopter at first but noticed that there were no blinking lights on that object either. The light was a solid red. No blinking or anything else that one would associate with a typical helicopter flying over a large city with an airport nearby. This red light moved faster than the first light we'd spotted.  Not freakishly fast but more like a helicopter than anything else.  It looked like it was moving toward the green light but then it stopped and appeared to just hover near where the green light was. At this point my girlfriend and I noticed that the bright green light we\u2019d originally noticed looked like it was starting to fade.  It disappeared momentarily and then reappeared in the same spot we\u2019d last seen it. As this was happening the red light began to fade and disappeared completely.  This left the green light as the only light we could see hovering in the sky. It remained in the sky for another twenty seconds (approx) until it too disappeared completely. Seconds after the lights vanished we noticed two helicopters flying (circling?) around the area where we had seen the three mystery lights. The entire sighting lasted about five or six minutes.",

I looked almost straight up and saw three disks in a close triangle formation, metallic silver or shiny aluminum colored. They were not moving. Although the sky was clear blue, the air around the formation shimmered, much as you would see the mirage effect in the distance on a hot highway.  I watched them for a moment, trying to figure out what I was seeing, Seconds later, all three disks went straight up very quickly in formation and disappeared. The mirage effect lingred in the sky for a few seconds after the disks were not visible.  I have not told this to anyone, even my parents.

      "story": "Aircraft with white flashing headlights, no other lights, no discernible sound Okay, this starts out as a pretty boring story, but bear with me \u2013 it has an interesting ending. I was standing in our driveway stargazing as I often do. The sky was mostly clear. We're 4 miles south of Long Beach Airport, and the sky was busy as usual with air traffic. One plane caught my attention as it flew south toward the general area of downtown Long Beach about 3 or 4 miles to my west. The only light I could make out was a bright white headlight that flashed every second-and-a-half to 2 seconds. When it reached my latitude, it banked east toward me. Now I could make out 2 white headlights which continued flashing in unison at the same interval. No green lights. No red lights. No other lights. Just 2 flashing white headlights.  It was much higher than the altitude police helicopters fly. The 2 lights were about a pinky width at arm's length apart. At this point I was figuring that it was a plane, and that there was a logical explanation for the missing identification lights. So I took a look at it through my binoculars, and I could make out 2 lights, but before I could bring it in focus it vanished. So then I looked without my binoculars, and after about 4 seconds it flashed once or twice more and then it vanished altogether.  The sky was clear. I watched for about 10 seconds.  By this time there was a tree blocking my view of where it would be if the plane reappeared, but I was satisfied at that point that it was gone, and that it was a plane with malfunctioning lights or maybe something else.  As for its sound, there were several planes in the area at the time and to tell you the truth I wasn\u2019t even focusing on its sound, but I don\u2019t remember any sound coming from it. So I\u2019m not 100% sure. If it made a sound, it didn\u2019t stand out.  So I spent the next 15 seconds watching planes, just kind of looking around, and then ! I surveyed the area right above me. Okay, now here\u2019s where it gets weird. The plane reappears flying the opposite direction. At least I assume it was the same plane. Same size, same 2 flashing white headlights.  I had never seen a plane with that light configuration (I\u2019m 56), so logic told me it was the same aircraft. Then about 2 flash sequences later, when it was directly overhead, poof! Gone. In all my years of stargazing, I\u2019ve never seen a plane make a 180 degree turn in 15 seconds and then disappear.  So I thought that was a little strange. In the next hour, I saw 2 unusual aircraft, or maybe it was the same aircraft, in the north sky from around Cassiopeia westward.  The first of these 2 sightings began as a flash of white light, like a star, in the constellation Cassiopeia. I could make out a dark object either losing altitude or flying NE which flashed again about 3 seconds after the first flash. Then about 3 seconds later it flashed again, and then I lost it behind trees.  It travelled about a width of my fist at arm length between flashes. Then about 15 minutes later, an aircraft with the same description appeared in the NW flying south about 2 miles to my west.  It flashed twice, about a 3 second interval, and sometime before the third flash it turned east and flashed about 2 or 3 more times at 3 second intervals and then it vanished. As for sounds, again there were planes in the area but I can\u2019t remember any sound coming from them. So if they made a noise, it didn\u2019t stand out.  When it was flying east to west, it looked to be about a mile to my north.  Neither of the aircraft appeared to be much more than a thousand feet high. These sightings happened 5 nights ago. I\u2019ve been watching the skies almost every night since and I haven\u2019t seen anything out of the ordinary, just the usual planes and helicopters.  And I had never seen anything like that in my life prior to that night. ((ADDENDUM TO ORIGINAL REPORT)) Aircraft with white flashing headlights, no other lights, no discernible sound This is a correction to the report I submitted Sunday, October 14, 2012 at 00:51:43  Near the end of my report, it should read:  When it was flying west to east, it looked to be about a mile to my north.

It was not a helicopter. I continued to watch it as we turned North on Long Beach Blvd. and it was still visible as we stopped at a Chevron Gas Station on the Corner of Long Beach Blvd. and PCH. As we got out of the car I continued to watch it as my boyfriend pumped gas. Then all of a sudden, about 3 smaller orange lights \u201cfell\u201d from the large orange globe. (Unsure if the falling lights were other craft or not.) I exclaimed in surprise to my boyfriend and he came over to watch. Then another several lights fell from it again, bringing to mind an image of embers falling or liquid metal dripping as the smaller lights fell and faded as they fell below our line of vision. Then the main orange orb disappeared. It did not fade into the distance as a plane would. It was just GONE.

      "story": "2 white star-like objects moving in tandem, synchronized turn, no plane lights Once in a while I like to sit in the back yard and gaze at the stars.  Tonight was one such night.  To the south I saw what I thought might be the Pleiades, but after my son and I examined it through binoculars, we could see that it was a single star. Remembering that the Pleiades was higher in the sky, we walked around to the front of the house where we had a wider view of the sky, and as soon as I started searching for the star cluster, a bright white light suddenly appeared high in the southern sky.  My son saw it, too. It lasted for about a second or two, and got about as bright as Venus gets when it\u2019s at its brightest before it faded. I quickly grabbed my binoculars which were hanging from my neck and focused on the area where we saw the bright light. My son was also searching the area.  Then both of us noticed that there were two star-like objects moving vertically in tandem, pretty much due north, about two thumb widths apart, arms fully extended (my son later told me).  They maintained precisely the same distance apart.  As I was tracking them with my binoculars, I was explaining to my son that they were probably satellites because the lights weren\u2019t blinking and they were moving about the right speed for satellites, although I was thinking that they were moving a tad too fast to be satellites.  But that seemed like the most logical explanation. Then he asked me why there would be two satellites, and while I was thinking of an explanation, the two objects suddenly banked about ten degrees to the east, still moving north.  They started the turn at precisely the same moment.  It wasn\u2019t a sharp-cornered turn, but the radius was fairly tight.  What amazed me was how precisely they maintained their distance apart.  Then we both lost them around the constellation Cygnus.  My son later told me that the trailing object was the one that got bright. One explanation is that they were military jets, and the bright light was one of the jets reflecting the sun which had set three hours earlier.  And I suppose that the pilots could have been able to maintain a precise distance apart.  What didn\u2019t seem right, though, is that they didn\u2019t have any blinking or colored lights. They were single white lights, like medium-faint stars. I\u2019m 55, amateur astronomer, been sky-gazing since I was a kid, and besides one strange object I witnessed from a plane a few years ago, which I reported here (it\u2019s possible it may have been a Mylar balloon), I\u2019ve always been able to explain everything I\u2019ve seen.  Although the best explanation might be that they were military jets, the absence of blinking or colored lights or contrails (we couldn\u2019t hear any engines, either, but they seemed to be way up there and we wouldn\u2019t necessarily have heard them) seems to place that theory in question.  And I don\u2019t have any other explanation.",

This happened for about 2 minutes as the objects continued to fly south until both the solid gold light and the sparkling trail of each of the two extinguished.

She described it as a white circlular object. She said it looked like a full moon, but smaller.  She told me it was no star. It couldnt have disappeard like that if it were any planet. I then began to do some research right away.  I looked for ufo sighting with in the same city and the same month.  I then came across a video of a sighting in my city that happened 4 days prior to today.  I showed my sister the video and she said it looked exactly like the one she saw. My heart literally sunk thats when i knew i had to report it.  I need answers.  I want to know what is going on.  I just think it's very frightening because the same object was seen in the same city and state 4 days earlier.",

I saw 3-4 oval in shape but a reddish orange color ufo's in the sky.  The glow was more like the light a candle would put off but of course much larger but that kind of a glow not like the light from a headlight or electric light bulb.  There is a large church a block to the east of me.  The church has a large steeple. the objectscame up from behind the church straight up and then moved at a slowish speed up about what I would say is maybe a half a mile and moved in a north west direction.  The objects came up one at a time and followed the exact pattern of the craft in front of it.   They stopped overhead of us and they just sat in the sky for several minutes.  Then they disappeared one at a time. the first one up dissapearing first then the second and then the third and so on.  If I had to compare the size I would say about the size of a vw bug.  It's hard to say because of the distance and the bright glow and of course I was very excited.   I was waving my arms at them and there was just one left in the sky and just before it disappered it flashed. and my husband/ boyfriend said wow it flashed at you.  I was so tripping on it .  I tell you,  it was great. There is no way this was a lantern or anything like that. the movments were percise and intentional.  There was no sound from these crafts at all. silent.

      "story": "LONG BEACH, CA.. interacted with a UFO while stargazing and using a Green high output laser beam. so i was star gazing in my back yard as i normally do and i come across a star i think is moving that may just be a.  i recently purchased a green laser which emits a visible beam 5miles, like what you see in the military.  i come across what i think is a satellite . so i point my laser at it and it seems to have moved away from it,  i thought i was tripping or maybe had shaky hands so i position myself against my step fathers truck to get a posture while pointing and using my 2 hands instead of one. Here comes the crazy part.  As i start pointing my laser at this object i notice that it is moving and not moving in a single direction as you would see with a satellite.  this thing starts moving left, right, side to side almost trying get out of my beam as i point at it, i do this for about 2 mins until i start feeling like i should tell some one but know one at my home was home and nor where any of my neighbors in their backyards . So what do i do ? well, i thought since i am seeing this and i cant tell know one nor video tape it i get the idea to start circling the object as to attract people to looking at it instead of me pointing a laser directly on it.  i want to add that this idea came because i live along side the 710 fwy and i know for a fact people can see my beam from far so i new i can maybe get some people in traffic to see it and i hopefully was successful with that cause what happen next gave me the chills up and down my spine and i still have the chills as i write this. also i want to add that this isn't the first time i seen something i cant identify, but it is the first time i ever interacted with one . As i start circling the object it get more aggressive to moving away from the light as if knowing i am circling it and in doing so giving up its position , i continue to do so and it keeps trying get out of the circle i put it in, i then notice that when ever the beam would be in front of its direction it will quickly move away from it as if it was scared of crossing it as weird as it sounds.  i know this wasn't a satellite nor a plan cause planes cant move that fast nor in the aggressive manner this object moved.  I then start to notice that this object is positioning itself over my house , pretty much right over me so at this point i am pointing straight up with my neck looking straight up to the point my neck hurts . i got kinda freaked out at that point even more and start thinking about all abduction movies and thinking maybe this thing is position itself over me to know my location, i don't know but it really freaked me out . now my laser starts dying which emits a le! ss visible beam that can bee seen , at this same time i notice the object starts to also fade but still remains over what looks to me like its directly over me but just in the heavens with the stars pretty much hanging out flying around. my laser then dies and honestly i felt alone at that moment cause i was in complete darkness and it hit me that what i was seeing was real and was interacting with me and my laser beam . i stare at it for a couple mins more , noticing that its not really moving anymore but staying directly above me where it positioned itself in the heavens.  my lasers off,i am in darkness, i start getting more freaked out thinking that maybe its gonna get me , beam me up , i just start thinking of all the movies i seen with people interacting with ufo's which never end well. i wont lie i start feeling fear in me and something telling me go inside the house and recharge my laser. i do so , and decide to report for the first time an experience i have with a ufo that to me is the scariest encounter i have ever had the privilege of seeing . since a kid i have star gazed, i am 29. i have seen many weird things in the skies i cant explain to this day which i am sure allot of people have seen things many times also if they star gaze frequently thru their life . what i saw was real and i really cant explain any more into detail about it but what i explained . i haven't gone back outside my house yet and do plan to after i finish this sighting description . honestly i am kinda scared to go back out and look at the sky and or see if its s! till in the same spot but i am only because of my curiosity and faith that nothing bad will happen to me .  it looked exactly like a dim star or satellite that moves in a single continues lane that many people i am sure have seen . it didn't make any different colors it just stayed white like the stars , it moved quick, it moved away from my laser as if it were scared of it or didn't want to be seen or pointed out. i don't know what it was but know it wasn't a plane . i really wish i had someone over tonight to be my witness . i actually bought the laser because i would frequently see things through out my life in the skies, that i just wanted to finally point them out when star gazing and hopefully show other people . sadly i was alone and still am , my report is done and i hope who ever reads this maybe gets the same idea with the laser pointer and or someone saw a green beam pointing along the 710 fwy at an object moving away from my beam in the skies high above the heavens , at 9:00 pm . this is is not a hoax. hopefully some one has seen something similar or interacted with a ! ufo as i have with a high output green laser beam .",

She brought up the subject out of the blue which is even stranger since I had never met her before until that moment.   I looked up in the sky while we were talking and saw a silver triangle high up in the atmosphere.  I suppose you could say it was the size of a penny considering the distance.  I pointed up toward the sky and said: \"What's that?'  She looked up and said she didn't know__then this object 'faded' out.   Further away from where this object appeared, a jet was passing. I wonder if anyone on this jet saw what we did? Guess this is another mystery we'll never find the answer to.   The sky was cloudy that day so I don't know if it just 'disappeared'' or if the cloud cover was the reason it faded.  Nevertheless it wasn't another jet because it was motionless.",

I walked out into my backyard and I looked up to the east to see a bright yellow orange fireball with red tinge traveling from the northeast to the southwest at a moderate speed in relation to its size and distance from my standpoint. I witnessed the object for 25 to 30 seconds. The fireball then flickered out to reveal a white pulsating light on a dark metal looking object which flashed 3 times and then extinguished all while the object turned course toward the south east and  appeared to accelerate at a high rate of speed. I thought what I was looking at could possibly have been Chinese lantern but there were no real true signs of fire and the lantern would have been traveling against any wind currents present from the south.  Also, when the object burnt out, it did not fall to earth but accelerated away holding its altitude until it disappeared out of view just as an aircraft in level flight would. I attempted to video the object with the camera on my pho! ne for about 20 seconds zooming in on the object at the midpoint of the filming. The video actually recorded was only two seconds.  I was able to get a few good stills out of the 2 seconds of video that I did capture. I have witnessed the approaching fire ball which seems to drop its cargo and run once before on 09/30/09 at around 22:50 hours.

      "story": "Loud military jet precedes 2 fast-moving yellow-orange orbs My wife and I had a spectacular UFO sighting tonight. We were all settled in for an episode of Vice (HBO), when I heard a loud whoosh, but I thought it was part of the soundtrack of Vice.  My wife exclaimed, \"What the hell was that?\" So she's looking out the window behind the couch explaining to me that the sound was coming from outside.  I followed her as she dashed out the front door. I could still hear the trademark military jet-type whooshing sound in the distance.  It's sort of an irregular pulsating whoosh that starts suddenly and ends as suddenly as it started, and then repeats that maybe five or six times afterwards, the sound fading off. So we're standing out front looking at the cloudless sky, and I'm telling her \"You know, sometimes when military jets are sent low over areas they don't usually don't fly over, it means there was a UFO spotted in the area.\"  And not 30 seconds later, out of my left eye I see a light-orange-yellow spherical-shaped light moving NNE to SSW high in the SSW sky moving SSW through the constellation Orion.   About a second later, as I'm alerting my wife to what I'm seeing, a second light that looked just like the first light appeared about 3\" at arm's length to the west, moving exactly parallel with the first light.  A second later, the second light faded out, and the first light continued on with its SSW trajectory a couple more seconds and quickly faded out. I've seen probably 100 meteors, including 2 fireballs, 6 or so comets, satellites.  And I've seen some unidentified stuff, too.  But this was by far my most spectacular and unusual sighting.  I'm 58. They moved slower than a meteor but much faster than any jet I've seen at that apparent distance. We both got the sense that the lights were at least 10,000 feet up. They certainly weren't real close. I got a real good look at the lights.  They weren't steady, like light bulbs. Nor did they strobe.  They were distinctly round, but diffuse, and they gave the appearance that they were moving behind a sheet of water, or slightly translucent film with an irregular surface. At the point of fade they were maybe 40% of the diameter of a full Moon. Some years ago when I spent a lot of time during the day at home, quite a few times I'd hear the same identical sound of a military jet overhead or nearby.  They're tremendously loud.  Only once did I catch a glimpse of it.  It was flying north to south towards or maybe past downtown Long Beach, which is due west.  I didn't know about the UFO connection back then.  I wonder if some (all?) of those incidents were UFO related. By far the most unusual \"object\" I've ever seen in the sky. And I kinda-sorta predicted it.  ;) ((ADDENUM FROM WITNESS)) This is a better and more detailed synopsis than the one I submitted to NUFORC a little while ago.    *** On the evening of March 20th, my wife and I had an incredible UFO sighting that I posted about here. Last night we had another UFO sighting.  Same part of the sky - south of Long Beach, CA over the Pacific. At about 10:05 PM, I went outside to sky-gaze as I often do.  It was fairly overcast.  The Moon, which sat high in the WSW sky, was shrouded by the low clouds and cast a diffuse glow.  A couple of minutes later, due south and about 30 degrees above the horizon, another diffuse light appeared behind the clouds.  It was white and looked similar to how the Moon looked, but not as diffuse.  It gradually grew brighter, and as it did, two other similar looking diffuse white circles of light appeared, forming an equilateral triangle.  They were all about a third to half the diameter of a full Moon and two to three finger widths apart at arm's length.  At this point I yelled for my wife, called her on my cell, and knocked on the pane glass living room window to get her attention.  She came running out with her i-phone and saw the triangular formation just before it faded out.  As those three lights faded out, a brighter light appeared in between where the other three lights were, and grew brighter, casting a bright glow against the surrounding clouds.  We could make out a fairly well-defined bright star-like light at the center and the surrounding glow it cast was about three-quarters the diameter of a full Moon.  She managed to catch that final light on video before it faded about 30 seconds later.  All of these lights were perfectly stationary. I stayed out for another hour, but I didn't see any more.

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I was waking from my house to Ralph's ices about 1/3 mile from my house with my 3 cousins on beech street when we stopped to look at 2 fixated lights hovering over the ocean.  They were horizontal and triangular, and appeared to me to be at least 1/8 over the oceanfront part of the  beech given my proximity.  They never moved. . 40 seconds from the time I decided to film it.  I snapped one shot across the street, and one  second before I confirmed what my first thought was. I was  perhaps 2 blocks from the ocean on beech st on and fumbled for video mode.  I was able to get the  .40 second shot before I saw a direct plane or such pale out or muffle my video.   The occurance of moment left us perplexed  discussing coincidence and chance ...  After the fact.

Last night we had another UFO sighting.  Same part of the sky - south of Long Beach, CA, over the Pacific. At about 10:05 PM, I went outside to sky-gaze as I often do.  It was fairly overcast. The Moon, which sat high in the WSW sky, was shrouded by the low clouds and cast a diffuse glow.   A couple of minutes later, due south and about 30 degrees above the horizon, another diffuse light appeared behind the clouds.  It was white and looked similar to how the Moon looked, but it was a little smaller in diameter.  It gradually grew brighter, and as it did, two other similar looking diffuse white circles of light appeared, forming an equilateral triangle. At this point I yelled for my wife, called her on my cell, and knocked on the pane glass living room window to get her attention.  She came running out with her i-phone and saw the triangular formation just before it faded out.  As those three lights faded out, a brighter and less diffuse white light between where the other three lights were appeared and grew brighter, casting a bright glow against the surrounding clouds.  All of the lights were perfectly stationary.  She managed to catch that final light on video before it faded about 30 seconds later. All of these lights were perfectly stationary. I stayed out for another hour, but I didn't see any more.",

This was without question, something that must be from another world.  The orange lights looked as if it was a huge fountain of the largest fireworks ever that were stopped, (freeze framed) for 10-15 seconds.   Suddenly they started moving forming a not so perfect circle, then forming a v-shape, then a not so perfect line.  Then one by one disappeared.  I have never witnessed a ufo before but now I have.  I am true believer and their were several witnesses around me.   BTW, the Long Beach Herald investigated and assured that there were no Chinese lanterns sent up anywhere that night.  Even if there was, this way too far and were controlled.... ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes Peter it was 100% the 14th.

They were two lights, perfectly in sync, about a thumbs distance apart when you hold your arm out in front of you.  They were so synced I began to think it was part of the same object-if so, it would have had to be HUGE.  The leading light stayed the same amount of brightness for about 15 seconds, but the second light became VERY bright.  Easily the brightest thing in the sky.  The other two in my group all stood up to try to get a better view.  And the.  It was gone.  The second light went out completely! , and the first gradually dimmed until it was out of our field of view.

I looked closely to see if there were any flashing red or white safety lights (like normal man-made airplane) but it was just a solid orange light with somewhat of a fog around it.. (note the night sky was crystal clear a few minutes earlier).. and it was approaching me fast!  I grabbed my phone and BOLTED downstairs to the end of street (which sits right on the sand) to get a video.  By the time I got there, what was once just hundreds of feet away was now thousands of feet up and same altitude as other airplanes (which you could differentiate by the flashing white and red safety lights).  The bright orange light continued to to move southeast and vertical *extremely* fast towards the stars until it shifted direction, dropped down super fast then faded away. I captured the whole incident on video..  It's very obvious no man made craft can move that fast.   Video submitted to ufocntr@nwlink.com.

I made a sudden Uturn to head back to higher ground and pulled over to take some pictures.  As minutes passed the lights moved across the horizon but stayed in the formation.  I then noticed as i scanned the skyline, of which i had about 180 degree field of vision i took notice of an inordinate amount of other aircraft and helicopters flying around rapidly.  From where i stood i could see clear for at least 20 miles. When i would unfocus my eyes on a darker area of the sky, other faint! lights throughout the sky became visible, some moving slowly, others staying in place.  After a few minutes i got back in the car to head home.  On the 10 minute drive from the hill to my house I saw four helicopters and what i belive to be a military jet, all moving quickly and at varying altitudes. I captured some very clear shots of what i saw and upon returning home pulled them up on my laptop to adjust contrast and other photo settings.  This revealed many more lights than i was aware of as well as showed that the three main lights I was trying to photograph were all in the shape of a triangle/delta.",

It was probably 100-200 feet up and steadily moved horizontally to the southeast out over the ocean before it blinked out.  I got a good look at it through my binoculars.   Sad to say, I was disappointed; I immediately recognized it as some kind of lantern.  I saw a burning flame surrounded by an egg-shaped transparent \"plastic bag\" and I could even see a few strings dangling from the bottom.   I called my wife out to take a look at it and she reached the same verdict.  No other orbs followed. This is not to say that I think all orange orb sightings are lanterns.  There have been numerous truly puzzling orb sightings that don't seem to match the description of something that was human-made.",

In the span of about 6in in my field of vision the object at extreme rate of speed traveled that distance and immediately stopped with out any distance to decelerate.  It did the several times over the course of the sighting. it moved in straight lines and in a tight circular motion and it appeared to hop like in motion quickly accelerating and stopping moving in a circular motion as well as quick straight lines.  At approximately 5:30 - 5:45 a high altitude aircraft traveling east passed by the object that was frozen in motion, after aircraft passed by the object it followed behind at about a half inch distance for 6-7in until the object broke away and traveled back to its original position.  Continued to move erratical! ly until 6:10 - 6:11 am it abruptly stopped and froze in place, when a second dimly lit smaller light quickly moved from the north to the south and met the first light and stopped at about 9 in away and moved from left to right maintaining the same distance away.  About 20 min later the second approaching object moved closer to the first. the first object quickly accelerated away and put about 12in of distance between them in an instant and then flashed out lights. they continued this same patter until I lost sight of both objects with the rising sun.

An avid sky-watcher and amateur astronomer, I've seen meteors, fireballs, comets, and satellites, as well as things that are frequently reported as UFOs, such as aircraft, birds, bugs, and advertising lights.  I spend a lot of time sky-watching, and hadn't seen anything unusual in over a year, until last night. At 8:23PM, I noticed a bright glowing orange light a few degrees east of due north and about 20 degrees above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a plane, because it seemed to be near Long Beach International Airport, but the color wasn't typical of aircraft lights.  Through my binoculars, it looked slightly vertically elongated, as opposed to round.  I noticed no other lights on it.   I also couldn't bring it into focus and the upper portion was fuzzier than the bottom portion.  It slowly moved upwards and then slightly eastward, and then it moved slightly erratically and quickly faded out without a trace.  Having read numerous reports about the propensity of orange orbs to travel in groups, I watched for more, but no more appeared. Then, at about 8:45 PM, I was looking towards the SSE at a light that was probably a high altitude jet, and in the same general area a bright blue light appeared about 20 degrees above the horizon.  It was about as bright as Venus when it's at its brightest.  Then less than two seconds later it disappeared without a trace.",

Weather  conditions were clear \u2013 no rain or clouds.  It emitted no sound.  I could not estimate its altitude.

I spotted the object while doing sit-ups, and stared at it for about 45 seconds.  I switched positions to do a different exercise and took my eyes off the object for about 5 seconds, when I looked back the object was no where to be seen.  And that's when I started to actually digest what I may had just seen.   I stopped my workout and scanned the area of sky I originally saw the object, for about 5-10 minutes.  I was baffled that it had just disappeared so quickly after I looked away for a brief moment.",

      "story": "Rolling Sphere Across Sky At approximately 18:38 on February 24, 2018, while walking to my apartment, I happened to be looking up at the stars which were nice and bright (for urban Long Beach, anyway) . My attention was drawn to the west by a steady orange light in the sky.  It caught my attention because of its orange color and lack of any apparent strobe or beacon that normally would be seen on an aircraft.  I caught a brief glance of it as I was walking and then a tree came between me and the light so that I temporarily lost sight of it.  When I cleared the tree a second or two later, I noticed that the light was either climbing in altitude, or coming towards me (or both), and that it was a steady orange glow, almost like a landing light on an aircraft but way more orange.  I was kind of fixated on this light, expecting at anytime to see a beacon or navigation lights which would have given it away as an aircraft when it started to fade and then disappeared completely.  Not behind a clou! d or anything, but just faded out within the span of about a second or two at most.  There might have been a second light behind (closer to the horizon) the first light, but, as I stated, I was transfixed on the brightest light, and only noticed a second light that disappeared along with the first light at the same time.  That second light might have been an aircraft, as LAX outbound traffic is frequently in that vicinity of the sky, but I can\u2019t be certain as I was only half aware of that light. Anyway, as I was contemplating what I had just witnessed (I was stopped a few doors down from my apartment at this point, staring up at the sky), an object came \u201ctumbling\u201d by at, what seemed to me, just above treetop-level! It was moving in an easterly direction and, for lack of a better word, tumbling.  It remind me of a semi-translucent, roughly spherical object with a very dim, orangey glow.  There seemed to be a darker patch on the object that rotated with it\u2019s apparent tumble, this is how I could see it\u2019s rotation. It moved at a steady, quick pace; I\u2019m bad at estimating speed, but I\u2019d say maybe between 20 to 35 mph.  It made no noise and was visible to me for approximately 5 to 8 seconds, I\u2019d say.  It moved eastward and looked to be descending as it crossed my field of view, but I could be wrong.  It had a steady glow, no flickering like a candle or anything.  I thought initially that maybe it was a bag with a candle or something in it, but I\u2019ve seen flying lanterns before, and this didn\u2019t look or move like the lanterns I\u2019ve seen in the past.  It had been a windy day in Long Beach, but when I saw this object, there was no wind that I could detect. One other thing--as I was driving home about 10 to 15 minutes before my initial sighting of the original light, I had noticed a couple looking up at the sky rather intently on the sidewalk of the street I was driving down.  Now I wish I had stopped and asked them what they were looking at.  Maybe it was related to what i saw\u2026",

I have never made any such report before but this was truly a strange event.  The sky was cloudless but for only a few miles square in this northern part of the sky; and in the middle of this \"clearing\" there was a large spotlight- like a flashlight around 1/2 the size of the moon shining eastward.  The power of this perfectly focused and precise light was extremely intense and appeared to cover at least 50 miles shining parallel to the ground at, and I'm guessing of course, a height of around 20,000 feet?  This enormous spotlight/flashlight was not moving whatsoever; it was transfixed in the night sky.  Witnesses were absolutely freaked out, and although I am not too excited about much of anything, I will admit that this was quite creepy and without obvious, logic! al explanation.  My 9 yr old daughter will not stop talking about it.  We took photos. It lasted full strength for around 20 minutes and then abruptly tapered off, and close shut, in around 15 seconds.  Then all the witnesses started talking together, comparing notes, trying to figure out what we'd seen.  It was a professional crowd and yes there was some anxiety among everyone.  I cannot find a single report anywhere of this event but then again I am not part of the UFO community.",

I was outside on my deck talking to my wife on the cell phone when I saw the craft moving north to south at about 60 degrees above the horizon.  There was no sound---just what appeared to be 4 red lights in a tight circular and or square pattern.  It didn't look like the typical lights pattern of a commercial or private aircraft.   I wasn't able to get my phone switched to video mode fast enough but did get one photo taken, which sadly doesn't do much justice to  what I way ((NUFORC Note:  My report on Coast to Coast on August 22, 2018, addressed a sighting in Long Beach, California, no Washington.",
