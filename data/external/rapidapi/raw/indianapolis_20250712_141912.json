It flew towards an industrial park 5 min from the dog park.   I stayed for about 10 min to see if it would come back, but I lost it.  On my way back home passing the industrial park on my right, there was a helicopter.  I was driving and couldn\u2019t really tell, but to me it looked like it had no markings and it could have been a black helicopter.  There is a military base 10 min away from the park and industrial area.  I was driving and could not stop so I can't confirm it was a black helicopter.  I don\u2019t think it a coincidence that I see a UFO and there\u2019s a helicopter flying around the vicinity after.

      "story": "Gravity-Defying Orbs in Triangle Shape On the night of February 20th, my wife and I decided to step outside to take in the beautifully serene property of our recently purchased home.  Immediately upon stepping onto the back porch, we both looked up to see what we thought was a spotlight, even though where we live made that impossible.  I quickly stated that it must be the moon, while my wife directed my attention to the moon behind me, clearing up that mix up.   As we began to try and get a better look at the lights, a clear shape took form, there were 3 GIANT white orbs in a perfect triangular shape.  When I say GIANT, I truly mean that this craft (if one solid unit) must have been the size of a football field.  I work in an industry that allows me to make fairly accurate scale analysis in a moments notice and my brain simply could not process the shear scale of the craft(s).  I jumped up onto the bench on our back patio to peer over the roof top to see where it was moving and it appeared to be complet! ely silent and heading East towards Geist Reservoir.  Just as my wife joined me standing on the porch bench, it became very clear that this was not of earthly origin....the triangle shaped craft quickly split into three orbs that shot in all different directions, breaking the laws of physics that we live by.  And just like that, it was gone. I have lived with this unsettling event now for 2-1/2 months and still do not know how to process what I saw.  I steadfastly believe that this planet has been visited by ETs at some point in the history of mankind, but to see something with your own eyes, and know that there are millions others like me....it\u2019s earth shattering.   I decided to share this information in the event it may help connect the dots to a bigger story, or at least preserve this event somewhere that it will not fall on deaf ears.   I pray almost nightly now, having never been a religious man...I pray that whatever that was will come back so I can try to rationalize what I saw.",

      "story": "Ultra-fast fly-by of 2 ufo's with associated light, noise, energy, electrical interference, UV radiation I swear this account is entirely accurate and 100% honest based on my unforgettable recollection and account made immediately after the event. I would testify to this in a court of law before God. Myself, Philip Burke, and Wesley Jinks, all eagle scouts and college students, witnessed strikingly similar events. I won the poker game and we stepped outside so Phil could smoke a cigarette. Phil was smoking under the porch by the basement sliding door. Wesley was walking back from his car after getting his wallet so he could pay up for his poker loss and was turning the southeast corner of the house when this incident began. I was completely sober because the antibiotics I\u2019m taking react violently with alcohol. It was between 2:55 and 3:00 AM, December 24th, 2006. I was centered on the east edge of my back patio off the basement. I was looking almost directly up at the northeast sky at maybe a 75 degree angle, attempting to look for the stars. It was evenly overcast that night with no rain and very little wind, about 40 degrees F and relatively calm outside. Very low level clouds in even formation meant that no stars could be seen. All three of us encountered two distinct identical waves of energy that streaked the sky with associated noise, light, and perceptible electric and magnetic energy unlike anything we had ever seen, heard or felt in our experience. I consider myself to have a sharp perceptional awareness and to be in touch with my senses. I was once missed by a lightning strike by 10 feet in a rainstorm and felt incredibly jolted, but this experience shocked or jolted me electrically ten times more than this previous lightning incident. I could tell the pulse was also very magnetic in nature, having had an MRI less than two months ago, and several in the past two years. I was mid sentence and went instantly silent when I was frozen by a sudden blast of energy coming from the sky. The blast originated in the west-northwest sky and moved east-southeast, crossing the entire sky from horizon to horizon in maybe two seconds, no idea as to altitude. There was initially no light associated with this blast, only pure energy. I could feel this energy. It coursed through my body. It felt like a concentrated pulse of electric and magnetic energy. This wave of energy that hit my body felt like the rush from jets doing a low altitude fly-by at an air show, only instead of wind, it was a burst of electric and magnetic energy that grew gradually, drastically spiked, then trailed off. As this pulse moved directly over my head it seemed to convey my entire body with it in the direction of its path. It was strongest at this point. I was frozen still in fear and my upper body wavered east-southeast as if I were getting pushed and pulled at the same time, only nothing physically touched me except energy. I moved my foot to keep myself from being pushed over, otherwise I feel as if I would have been knocked down. As this pulse approached, the associated noise quickly turned from a low drone or buzz to a tinny screech that was deafeningly loud for a fraction of a second then returned to a low drone. It was louder than anything I\u2019ve ever heard for that brief fraction of a second when it seemed to pass overhead. I covered my ears but kept my eyes wide open. As this pulse approached and the drone got louder, the sky filled with an ambiance of alternating green and blue waves that seemed to radiate linearly and at short regular intervals out from the path of travel of this pulse. The waves lit the overcast sky more and more brightly during the pulse\u2019s rapid approach, like they were being projected on the clouds from above the cloud ceiling. The brightness approached the brightness of day but everything around me had an eerie blue-green cast. An instant after the noise got unbearable, immediately as it began to subside, the entire sky filled with an array of every color in the visible spectrum for a brief instant, brighter than anything I have ever seen in the atmosphere, including the light of day at high noon. At this point I was facing east, looking up at a 45 degree angle. It seemed as if the pulse just passed. The sky was splotched with every color in the spectrum shining on the clouds in an instant dazzling array, predominately oranges and reds. It seemed as if a 3D electric matrix of visible fine lightning-like electricity filled the sky and approached from the east, went over my head. This matrix of many hundreds of tiny electric bolts, blue green in color, may have entered the lightning rods of my house. This is unclear because my eyes were still recovering from the brightness of the flash. The previous blue green waves mentioned may have lasted two seconds and grown in intensity, but this rainbow colored flash with the electrical matrix lasted maybe a quarter of a second. The power in the house then went off completely with no associated surge or fade. It just cut out then came back on about a second later. ! The neig hbor\u2019s floodlight remained on. All was calm and quiet for a second or two and my fear caused me to begin to turn towards the house to seek cover as I still looked at the sky. I then remembered Wesley was out front and I stayed outside to see if he saw anything. As he was approaching from the southeast corner of the house, maybe 75 feet away, ALL OF WHAT I HAVE RECOLLECTED THUS FAR WAS REPEATED IDENTICALLY, only we were paying closer attention to the sky now, so it seemed more extreme. I\u2019m uncertain whether it was or not. Both sets of pulses, flashes, buzzes, and power outages occurred in maybe ten or twelve seconds total. During the hour following this incident my ears hurt as if I had been at a rock concert that lasted for a week. My eyes hurt like I just walked out of a pitch black cave and stared at the sun. The cable TV and internet did not work until the next day. Once I regained my footing after the first blast, I felt like I was in instant shock, not from disbelief but from the actual energy inside me. I felt like I was filled to the brim with free electrons. My heart rate instantaneously spiked to its maximum and stayed there for quite some time. My body did sort of a hormonal dump, not quite like going into shock, but similar. It felt wonderful and terrible, as I imagine trying crack cocaine for the first time would be. These feelings gradually normalized over the course of two hours. Immediately after we came inside following the second pulse, we all confirmed something very, very weird just happened. I insisted no one speak of it and we all write separate personal accounts. Before we started writing, I ventured back outside and gazed at the sky for a couple minutes to find out if I could see anything else. The once thick cloud cover had opened to a strip of clear sky. This strip of clear sky was bordered by parallel lines of cloud cover on each side. The strip of clear sky appeared exactly where I sensed the two blasts had traveled horizontally through the sky from west northwest to east southeast. It looked as if the strip was opened by parting winds in opposite directions in the atmosphere. It stretched from horizon to horizon. I noticed Phil had dropped a lit cigarette on the ground. As I gathered paper I felt like I was on a mild dose of ten different drugs at once and my heart rate would not move from its peak. Wesley agreed to write an account, but Phil was ghost white and looked like he was about to have a heart attack. He noticed the cable TV signal had been lost (it worked fine before this incident) and opted for bed instead. Wesley and I did not speak to each other at all as we wrote, and only when we both finished did the results appear incredibly similar in every detail. While writing, I tried to relax and slow my racing pulse. As I did this, I experienced a euphoric pain free sensation originating in my spine and neck. I felt like I was five years old physically, except my heart ached like I was 80. As I wrote from maybe 3:10 AM to 4:30 AM this euphoric feeling gradually shifted from my spine to my muscles where I experienced major muscle relaxation. It seemed as if the electricity left me in waves starting at my core that rapidly moved to the surface. Each wave lasted about four seconds, and there must have been hundreds of them. As these hundreds of individual waves of electricity made it to the skin, I would get the strongest goosebumps I\u2019ve ever had and my hair would stand on end, noticeably on my arms. The feeling of muscle relaxation progressed to the point where I collapsed with my arms and chest on the table for about ten minutes where I could not write. I was motionless, simply enjoying the feeling when I was suddenly overcome by a strange migraine centered immediately behind my right ear near the surface of the skin. It was intense and piercing, and caused me to pick myself up, no longer experiencing any positive feeling symptoms. This migraine was very short lived and disappeared completely after only a couple of minutes. I have no history of headaches and have been routinely staying awake until 2-4 AM for about a month straight, so I felt no undue fatigue during any of this whole experience. The headache was enough to convince me I should go to bed. I tried to think about other things and eventually fell asleep. I slept through the night and woke up the next day with a sunburn on my face and hands, with redness and mild pain. My medication makes me very sensitive to UV radiation and I have been avoiding the sun completely. I ate breakfast, but could not keep it down. The cable TV came back on suddenly at about noon. Let me know what you think. THIS WAS THE WEIRDEST OF THE WEIRD.",

I have never reported this, but if I could find some of my old neighbors, I'm sure someone else could confirm this, as many of us saw it.  It began very high in the sky as a bright light (apparently the setting sun reflecting from it). Many of us were outside because it was warm weather, didn't get dark until late...us kids playing back in the days when you had three channels on TV and all doors and windows open because no one had air conditioning.  The object descended very slowly, but was in a straight down descent...no shaking or moving otherwise. It eventually settled right over our street (Phillips Drive) and was huge. It sat there for several minutes. Strange how there were no airplanes going to Weir Cook Airport during the duration of this sighting...usually, we could expect a jet to fly over every 3-10 minutes...they would get low enough to rattle the windows because we were very close to the airport.  Many adults and children stood in their yards watching as word spread quickly.  This craft was directly over my front yard. It was silver in color. At one point, I distinctly saw what looked like six dots (we didn't have computers then, but now I know it looked like computer data) emitted from the left side of the vessel. They were in perfect order.  After the dots were emitted, the object began a very slow ascent, in the same pattern it had followed downward: straight up, gradually.  Eventually it ascended from our sight.  I think everyone on our street made phone calls trying to find out what it was. Dad called the airport and they said it was a weather balloon.  But it wasn't a weather balloon.  I'm now 45 years old and I have never forgotten this experience. I'm a lifelong community journalist and have seen a lot of things, but I have never seen anything to match this.  I wish I could find someone in the old neighborhood who remembers it.

The quite bright green light withdrew back up in the air to the source, and then vanished.  One of the strange things of it was there was a great \"silent\" during the whole thing, no noise of any motor, just silent.

Then, for a period of 2-3 seconds, it appeared to steadily ascend upwards into the sky across a very short distance (about 2 arc degrees), moving in a southerly direction, until diminishing in brightness and no longer visible.

      "story": "Multiple Triangle shaped UFO's in V formation, then slowly follow interstate in Indianapolis On the morning of January 4th, 2008, just after midnight, my Fianc\u00e9e and I were driving east on E 96th street in Indianapolis, IN. As we approached Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport&#8206; (a small Cessna airfield and flight school) to our north west, I noticed about 6 bright yellowish/white lights in a V pattern; only it looked more like a \u201ccheck\u201d because the last top-left area was not lit. I\u2019m familiar with \u201cLights over Phoenix\u201d and I called my good friend who is quite skeptical of the famous video. At this point, I assumed I was looking at a couple Cessnas doing night training, but I wanted to call my friend and tell him what I was seeing just for fun. While I was on the phone with him, my Fianc\u00e9e pointed out that there was a 7th light now in the sky next to them- and much to my surprise, I looked up to see the 7th light duplicate to reveal an 8th light, which instantly glided into position, turning the \u201ccheck\u201d into a \u201cV.\u201d  Two minutes into the event, as we neared the small airport, it became evident that the lights were not tiny Cessna aircrafts. We could now also make out that each ball of light was in fact three large white lights, as if a commercial airliner had a large spherical light on the bottom-front of the plane and one large spherical light on each wing tip. About another 30 seconds passed and the \u201cV\u201d shape broke up and each aircraft began to pass over head. At a stop light, I opened my car door and stepped out to get a better look at these \u201cplanes.\u201d It was when one was right over head that I noticed a tiny red beacon in the very center of the aircraft that was blinking. There were no stars in the sky, and I cannot 100% fully verify that the triangle shaped craft was connected all the way around- but for whatever reason, despite never seeing a photo of one, I just assumed it was triangle shaped. It\u2019s like I could make out the darker matter. I couldn\u2019t make out wings or anything, but my mind saw it as a triangle.  My fianc\u00e9e asked me what was going on, and I told my friend I would call him back. I told her I thought the planes were actually \u201cUFO\u2019s\u201d because at that point I had no idea what they were and I wanted to scare her. They were large, triangular shaped crafts who made no noise as they passed overhead. I\u2019ll reiterate that it was midnight on a deserted street and literally no noise could be heard. I turned into an apartment complex and physically got out of my car and attempted to take a picture with my phone. My hand couldn\u2019t stay still and with the VGA resolution I snapped a blurred picture that looked more like headlights than anything else. I deleted it when I got home (before I realized the significance of our encounter.)  Because I couldn\u2019t bring myself to fathom alien crafts, and my fianc\u00e9e didn't appreciate me trying to freak her out, I just assumed I was witnessing some new airliner which I\u2019d never seen before and began to drive home. I took I-69 south and noticed one of the aircrafts following the highway. This struck me as extremely odd because I\u2019ve lived in Indy for quite a while and never before had I seen a low flying airliner simply \u201cfollow\u201d the highway. It passed overhead and I saw a few more off in the distance. It was actually really eerie. I\u2019d never felt like that before.  I got home and Googled whether or not Indianapolis International had any delays or runways out, explaining why so many aircrafts were simply cruising around the city at low altitudes at midnight. Literally every flight was on time. That\u2019s the last I thought about this event until today when I stumbled upon a website describing these triangle shaped UFO\u2019s with three white lights and a center red beacon. I noticed how they mentioned these crafts fly low over populated areas, and even follow highways. When I read that line I literally got chills. I\u2019m not going on record saying I witnessed alien crafts, but I will stand by my report that I saw exactly what all of these websites are describing as \u201ctriangle shaped UFOs.\u201d The physical description and behaviors mimic exactly as what I witnessed. I felt that I had an obligation to tell somebody or some organization that I witnessed a number of these crafts. I\u2019d sure like to know what they were. I\u2019d draw you a picture but it would look exactly like the dozens out on the web right now, except the center red light was about a quarter of the size as the three white lights. Well, that\u2019s that.",

As I drove closer I notice one yellow and two white lights at which the white lights where  going on and off.  The yellow light stayed on.   As we got closer we could tell it was not a helicopter, and it was hovering above Stop 11 and Madison Ave.  I pulled into Egg Roll King Restaurant and stop my car to take a look, my Grandson got out of the car, I stay in the car.  It wasn't a plane or helicopter.  Both of us could see the bottom clearly.  The bottom looked like a triangle shape, I could see metal beams two on each side of the triangle.  I could not see the top, cause we where underneath the object.  The only lights we seen where on the bottom of the triangle.  The white lights we going off intermittently as the yellow stayed on.  I could see the outline above the triangle of the object.  It appeared to be somewhat oval shaped, and what I mean by that there where two spots where it protruded out and it equal in shape, opposite each other.  The color of the object was metallic, the triangle beams where of a black color.  We watched this object from one 1-2 minutes, then it started to move to the south slowly, then to the west.  We got back into the car and followed it for about half and hour, it want faster then higher and higher then disappeared.  I never in my whole life seen anything like it.  There also was no sound coming from it. I am also sending a picture, it's not the best drawing, but it it close to what we saw.  Thank you",

It was already dark out (not sure of the season, but I don't recall it being winter).  We were on the highway (I believe it's highway 70) and I was sleeping in the back seat of the car. I was awakened by the sound of my grandfather and uncle trying taking about something they were looking at. I leaned forward over the front seat and saw a large circular object in the sky, it had white lights on the bottom and red lights on it's sides (it might have been red on bottom and white on the sides, it was long ago). You could tell by the movement of the lights that the object was spinning. My grandfather tried to tell me it was a small plane pulling a lit up banner, but even at 11-12 yrs old I knew what we were seeing. I had a chance to talk to my uncle about this even earlier this year at a reunion and he said, \"I don't know what that was, but it was not a plane pulling a banner, we told you that so you wouldn't be frightened.\" ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

THAT THEY SAID WAS DUE TO SURGERY ON BOTH (AT THE SAME TIME?).   THEN AFTER LIVING THERE FOR MANY YEARS THEY UPPED AND MOVED TO THEIR OLD PARISH.

I HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN OR BLOCKED OUT, I DONT KNOW,  THE WHOLE THING UNTIL MY BOYFRIEND STARTED TO MAKE FUN OF ME ABOUT WHAT I HAD SAW.  I WOULD HAVE AT LEAST CALLED MY DAD AS WE HAVE A MUTUAL INTEREST IN THE MATTER.  I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT ALL THAT HAPPENED?  HAS ANYONE HAD A SIMILAR SIGHTING OR EXPERIENCE (WEIRD FEELING, CANT EXPLAIN)?  I WAS COMPLETELY FLOORED!  HOW COULD I FORGET ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN SO IMPORTANT TO ME IN MY PAST, AS WELL AS, NOW IN MY PRESENT?  I AM REALLY BOTHERED BY THIS WITH NO ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT IT.

Flew from the northeast to southwest about 11:00 PM, then turned directly south and made an abrupt turn west. Not a right angle, but a very tight turn. Bright, almost throbbing orange-reddish glimmering light. I was watching TV and noticed the odd light out the window, I went to look, at first thought it was an airplane on fire, my wife and I went outside and watched it for about five minutes as it made it's way from the northeast, turn south then go west. It wasn't moving very fast at all, but steadily progressing. When it made its turn, it was near enough that we would have heard if it was a plane, but there was no sound. Do to the high cloud ceiling, we could also then see the shape against the clouds, looked somewhat like an upright \"V\", the ends pointing upward and the glimmering light at the bottom. And by glimmering, it was kind of throbbing, but with no certain pattern, that's why I first thought it was a plane on fire. The airport is to the west, but it wasn't following the line the planes normally do and passed by to the south of Indianapolis International Airport. I host an internet message board pertaining to automobile racing and I asked if anyone else in the Indy area had seen it. Many people were still outside at the time veiwing fireworks. I had 2 responses on the message board from people in the Indy area that had witnessed the same object and both had the same reaction I had. I work in the insurance industry and my wife is a registered nurse.",

I told her i don't know if i should make a wish or what. Well we traveled to 86th and Hague Rd back to my house and then to the southside on the interstate. All this time this star is getting closer as we head south. We were about 1/4 mile from the Raymond exit when we noticed this star was moving toward the interstate. My friend was like is that a round thing, i said OMG what is that. There were other cars on the highway that night but i don't know how to find them to see if they saw the same thing. It dissappeared. Were looking out of the windows and was like where did it go. We then both kinda looked out the whinshield window and it was just hoovering over us with no sound. we saw a rediculous amount of lights. We were so scared, we had never seen anything like this before. I just want to know what they are or were. No one believes us, i feel so crazy right now. Can anyone let me know if they saw the same thing or was my mind playing tricks on me. We saw quite a few of them that night the whole thing had to last for about 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours. we sat over a relitives house on the southside for about 2 hours and came back to my house on the eastside and saw another one.",

My parents still tell a story about how when I was about to start 2nd grade during our family prayers I jumped up crying and hid in the closet in the room that me and my sister shared.  I told them that I was afraid to go to 2nd grade when in fact I was scared of what I had just seen out my window.  My bed was right next a large, nearly full wall window that faced our backyard in the room that I shared with my older sister.  My parents sat on the floor and my sister was in her bed and I was in mine. I remember being bored, per usual, and staring out the window when this...pyramid I suppose floated casually past the window.  It wasn't like any of the pyramid's I've looked up online.  I guess those are like black triangles with lights on their corners?  This was covered in little metallic/chrome-ish rectangles that were either silver or lighting up different colors.  I remember pinks and yellows and blues so nearly primary colors, but you could tell they were still metallic silver underneath.  It was weird and seemed to lazily float past.  It didn't seem to be propelled by anything and didn't seem to be in any sort of hurry. Ok and I get it, I was little could have just been my mind messing with me and I can't remember if it was four sided (feel like it was) or three because I only saw it in profile and in my memory it looks like it floated right between my house and the gazebo on our deck which is only about 25 feet or so, so there are clearly some missing pieces.  Also I remember it was completely silent.  The thing that has finally brought this up in my mind again after 15 years is that my brother is a sophomore in college now and lives in my house here and we were talking about random weird stuff that happened in our old house (which was a lot...I don\u2019t know if that relates either) when he told me that when he'd been in about 2nd grade he'd been woken up two nights in a row by multi colored lights outside his window on the 2nd story but facing the street not the yard. He said he didn't see any object making them the 1st night because it'd been so bright but that the 2nd he'd seen a pyramid type object. I'd never told anyone about what I'd seen and neither had he till we had this conversation.  Now we just want to know if there\u2019s anyone else who possibly has seen something like this because after looking it up forever and all over the internet I can\u2019t find anything.

      "story": "I saw a reddish colored orb that was \"observing lighting show thunderstorms\" & it displayed 2 amazing climbs and a huge burst of speed. I was the captain, flying a four engine turbine powered aircraft (L-188) at flight level 230 (23,000 feet) inbound toward Indianapolis, Indiana, thence cleared to Ft. Wayne for the Detroit Star Ft. Wayne transition into YIP (Yipsilanti, Willow Run Airport, Mich.)  That\u2019s a  'standard terminal arrival route.'   I was on a heading of about 030 degrees.  Both my first officer & flight engineer were doing other duties when I first spotted traffic at my 1100 position, 10 miles & slightly below me.  As captain, I always kept the red instrument panel lighting at a absolute minimum setting so as to have the best visibility outside.   I first spotted a cranberry red light.  It appeared as if it were just another aircraft in the clear night sky, no shape or size, just a red light in level steady flight about 4000 feet below me & 10 miles to my left moving left to right at a steady speed of about 400 knots, about the same speed I was doing.  The size of the light was just like any other aircraft\u2019s rotating beacon or light, but this was a constant steady light, not like a normal pulsating rotating beacon that aircraft are required to have.  I noticed in was headed straight towards a large thunderstorm cloud that was at my 1 o'clock position and 10 miles.  This thunderstorm had constant & consistent in-cloud to in-cloud lighting strikes that really was lighting up the large cloud like a Chinese lantern.  The red light kept a steady 400 knot speed aiming right at the storm cloud.   Then when it got to within 200 yards of the thundercloud itself, the red light changed course from 110 degree direction to a 250 degree direction, instantly, still maintaining the constant 400 knot speed.  It didn't turn, like an aircraft makes a turn, it just changed course, instantly, like a curser on a computer is capable of doing when you jerk your mouse control quickly left to right.  Now it was heading straight towards a long line of constant lighting thunder storms, or squall line, that was at my 9 o'clock position and about 20 miles off my left wing tip.  As I watched the light move at a constant speed from my right to my left directly in front of me, it suddenly climbed at a perfect 45 degree up angle, leveled off for a about 2 miles and then climbed again at a perfect 45 degree up angle without any change in speed either time, to an altitude about 3000 feet above me.  It then turned slightly right to a heading of about 250 degrees straight toward a point just in front of the first of a long line of constant lighting thunderstorms. As soon as the red orb got established on the new heading towards the all lit up lightning squall line to my left, this red light went from its 400 knot speed to, I'm going to guess between 2ooo to 3000 miles per hour for about one long second then it again immediately went back to its slower 400 knot constant speed again.  It covered that 20 mile distance in just over a second, someone should be able to turn that into a speed in miles per hour.  It didn't accelerate up to that speed and it didn't decelerate back to the slower speed again, it just made an instant jump from a slow 400 knots to a really fast 3000 knot speed, for just over a second, covering the 20 mile distance and then immediately back to the same slower speed of about 400 knots.  It was amazing to watch.  After being a airline captain for over ten years I have never ever, before or since seen an object under such obvious control that maneuvered & changed speed instantly, at will, so they could maneuver to and observe the constant & consistent thunderstorm light show display. I watched it make one more turn to its left, a heading of about 190 degrees so as to parallel this long line of constant light shows off to its right side.  It was then behind me to my 8 o'clock position.  I brought the attention of my other two crewmembers just before the red light made its two 45 degree climbs, they saw that but couldn't see to jump in speed an jump back in speed because it was off to the left side of our aircraft.   It was under something\u2019s control, sightseeing at thunderstorm light shows in the night, making 45 degree climbs and capable of unknown speeds that amazed me to the point that I only thought was to turn off my rotating beacon/navigation wing-tip lights to hide my aircraft in the dark from its view.  But I didn't even think to call Indy ARTCC and ask if they had it on their radar.   My two other crewmembers really didn't grasp what I quickly brought to their attention, it all was over in 2 minutes.  I saw something amazing, I don't know what it was, I just hope it was from Earth. I was an ATP, flying four engine aircraft all over North, South America and Europe, for about 30 of my 40 years aviation life, and I never even came close to having an accident.  I was lucky to always fly well maintained aircraft.   That\u2019s my story.",

I became aware of a translucent object, a long, vertical rectangle with well-defined corners that floated north from the location of the flash. We are on Daylight Savings Time in Indiana and still have plenty of sunlight at that hour.   At first I doublechecked to make sure the object was not a banner being flown from an airplane, but the object had to be at least a mile from top to bottom. I slowed the car and got into the right turn lane and inched along.   The object, like a gigantic plastic film in the sky, kept moving north and was gradually assimilated or hidden by a darker cloud. I don't think this was a reflection of something on my windshield, because of the way the object moved, then remained stationary for a moment, even though my auto continued to move.  I had to turn into a parking lot at tha! t point and did not see the object after that. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) To the staff:  I filed a serious, legitimate report but mislabled the date of the incident as 5/01/10 instead of 6/01/10.  This was a typographical error made in the way people use the previous month or year right after the date has changed.  Because it's the beginning of June, I've been putting \"05\" as the month on paperwork.

At approximatley 10:00 p.m. EST on 7-25-09, I was in the driveway of my home in Lawrence, Indiana, a small town in the northeast section of Marion County (about 10 miles northeast of downtown Indianapolis. A female neighbor accross the street yelled at me, pointing at the northern sky and stated \"What is that?\" I immediately looked up and saw 20 to 30 bright yellowish disk-shaped objects, each with an illuminated vertical red center, flying accross the sky with no detectable sound. They were moving west to east about 40 degrees off the horizon at what appeared to be a high rate of speed. They were in a straight formation, although about 30 seconds into this encounter 2 or 3 seemed to \"break off\" from the formation and head south towards me for a few seconds, then quickly joined the others in their easterly trek. While I was watching this, the female neighbor's husband also came out of his house and joined his wife and I, who were watching this spectacle from the street. After another minute or so, the objects all disappeared into the eastern sky. I am a 56 year old college-educated male, who spent over 20 years in law enforcement in several different positions. I am currently an in-town truck driver, and I do not use illicit drugs or cosume alcohol. I can offer no logical explanation as to what these objects were that my neighbors and I saw.

I witnessed two similar phenomena occur twice within a half-hour or less of each other.  Not being too familiar with the area I don\u2019t know exactly where I was located, but for the first event, I\u2019d say I was between 25-50 miles northwest of Indianapolis, and for the second, maybe 50-75 miles northwest of Indianapolis.  For the second sighting, I\u2019m reasonably sure that I was located no more than halfway between Indianapolis and Gary \u2013 most likely closer to Indianapolis.  Giving a generous estimation, I\u2019d say both events occurred between 7:30 and 9:00 p.m. EST.  It\u2019s more likely that they occurred between 7:30 and 8:30, but I wasn\u2019t paying close attention to the time. I saw each time a single streak of yellow light occur in the northern sky heading north/northwest.  Each event lasted about 1 second each, moved extremely fast, and seemed to travel a great distance, assuming they were as far away as they appeared.  They looked to be pretty far away, but I could not accurately guess the number of miles.  The streaks were not directly overhead, but they were closer to being overhead than they were to the horizon.  They appeared to be as long as a pencil when it\u2019s held at arm\u2019s length away when they completed their streak.  There was a definite movement of the light.  That is, they did not appear immediately as a solid line.  They began as a point and streaked across a portion of the night sky, as if someone had drawn a line with a yellow marker.  As soon as the lights reached a certain distance, they faded immediately. There were no stars in the sky, and that coupled with the fact that I saw it twice led me to believe that they were not shooting stars.  It was not raining, nor was there thunder, so I\u2019m sure they were not lightning streaks.  They appeared out of and returned to nothing, it seemed.  They were both very unnatural-looking phenomena. This is my first report of a sighting.  I thought these events were strange enough to deserve reporting.  I\u2019d describe myself as being agnostic towards the existence of extra-terrestrials.  I don\u2019t not believe in them.",

This is a very commonly flown zone for passenger aircraft each half hour and then some. There is a small craft airport in Fishers, less than 2 miles from the area and this craft came from the uppermost part of the clouds, without wings DOWN and no noise, and no flapping as a bird. Neither was it the same as fighter jets with wide wings. It clearly looked liked a craft with the wings UP like on a navy shipped when they docked on the aircraft carrier. It was more than odd, it was not from this world. This particular craft came out of the clouds, approached toward my area directly downward and then veered oddly somewhat southbound on a dime, with absolutely NO movement from the UPWARD CLOSED wings. The wings were like a bird but stayed locked upward still. It then did a 360 motion (turn)  in FULL VIEW with a second, while still moving back into the clouds, upward like a helicopter\u2019s movements, without hesitation and clearly like no craft this world has or any I know of, 3-4 miles from it previous location in SECONDS. This was spotted by two individuals who did not know each other.  The other person saw it like me and slowed their driving from the hospital in awe, but moved on. I told my wife,  but I had no other witness before she came out of the hospital clinic area for allergies. It was awesome and yet fearful as this didn't look friendly but more of a probing observation. My heart was beating so fast, my mouth went dry and I couldn\u2019t talk.",

I am a police sergeant and while on duty on Friday (10/24/08) at approximately 22:20hrs., I observed about 10-15 amber colored lights floating or flying upwards.  I was parked in a downtown parking lot facing north when this occurred.  I iniatially observed 3 lights spaced pretty equally apart, but at slightly different altitudes.  Because of the downtown horizon I was unable to ascertain if they were coming up from the ground or just a slightly lower altitude.   These lights appeared to be coming from the northeast east quadrant of Marion County (about 10 miles away from me).   After noticing and watching the first three lights, I observed 3 or 4 more about 20-30 seconds behind, ascending in the same manner as the first 3. I then observed approximatly 6-8 more of these objects floating or flying upwards from the same area.  After getting so high into the sky the objects disappeared.   There was a cloud cover on this night, as we did have rainfall off and on.  I am not sure if the lights or objects just burned out or I was unable to see due to the clouds.  The puzzeling thing was that the clouds were going from west to east, and these objects were floating upwards from east to the west, into the wind, but only at a very gradual change.  Because these objects were going into the wind rather than with the wind, I quickly dismissed them as balloons of any kind but I could be wrong.   I have never seen anything like this before but there could be a legitimate reason for them.  I am just curious what they were.   I did watch the 6am newscast when I returned home from work and did not see any mention of the lights for legitimate or unknown purposes.  I did email the Indianapolis Star to see if they knew what the lights were, but so far I have not received a response.  I also observed what appeared to be a commercial aircraft heading towards the lights, but the lights had cleared its path by time the aircraft arrived in the area.  I would suspect there was a good possibility the aircraft pilots observed these lights as well.  The aircraft was going from the west to the east ( I assume leaving Indpls. Intn. Airport).   Several hours later when I returned to that spot (where I sit until a run comes out) I did observe what is mistakenly called a \"shooting star\" in the area.  This one appearred to be closer and brighter then ones I have seen in the past, but this could just be coincidence.  I just figured I would report it in case anyone else had seen it and no explanation could be found for the lights presence.  I also attempted to take cellphone pics and video of objects, but on review you can not see them due to poor camera quality on cellphone",

I was walking back home with my friend coming from his house on a dead end street (Corral & Birtha street)   When we reach the front of my house and sidewalk we noticed a huge round object hovering directly over us.  No sound, I can not explain how huge this was.  We had to actually move our heads back and fourth to see the entire object at one point.  It was rotating with multiple colored lights.  From our vantage point directly under it, it seemed to be like a spoke in a wheel.  The outer edges seemed to be rotating around the center and changing colors as it did that.   Suddenly the object shot straight up in a flash, hardly even able to distinguish between it and stars other than the color looked more orange from the distanced view.  We ran inside to tell my mother and finally we convinced her to come outside to see it.  By that time other neighbors was outside too looking at it.  The object had came back down to it's original position but occasionally would maneuver up, down or left or right and even diagonally.  Some times fast and sometimes slow.  The second time it shot up and was ha! rdly distinguishable between the stars other than the color difference.   We all went back inside and my mother called the police and reported it.  She also called the Air force. Moments later it was on the news on TV.  Wier Cook Airport at the time ( Now Indianapolis International ) had sent 2 fighter jets to intercept it.  We went back outside a third time and seen the jets heading towards the object. Suddenly the object shot straight upwards again so fast... but this time it disappeared completely out of view.  The news that evening said the Air force identified it as being a blown off course weather balloon. The next day it was in the news papers also.  A few day's later me and my friend was walking along side the road in the middle of the day and a blue car and 2  men in air force uniforms stopped us and asked if we saw anything strange in the sky. We told them about it as they took notes.  Then they drove away. I never head anything more about this.  Now I am 46 and still remember it so vividly. I tried researching the news archives without success. If anyone else who witnessed this please post here.  Obviously it was not a blown off course weather balloon. We do not chase weather balloons with fighter jets... I might add... they couldn't catch it...lol  I just wish I could find some archives or documentation on this.   Approximately 1972-75 Summer-time, at night very clear sky.  It was all over the news...  Why can't I find anything on it now?

      "story": "Saucer seen on W. Michigan Street and Porto Alegre I\u2019m a college student in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was around 6:26 P.M. on 11/7/2010 when I was standing on the sidewalk of W. Michigan Street that lead back to campus apartment housing at IUPUI (my college).  We usually have a lot of airplanes and helicopters around here, and at first I thought it was an airplane until I realized that it was flying way too low, but then I realized that it must have been a helicopter. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong I realized, as I looked up and saw a circular object flying right up above me, moving straight in the direction I was facing. It was huge, and if a full moon were out, I would have to say that from my perspective, I would have to say that maybe 15-17 full moons would be equal to the size of it. I\u2019d like to give a better comparison, but I was in a state of shock. I did spend what felt like a long time gazing at it, although in actuality, only about 2 minutes had passed. The sky was clear, but being in the city, it appears as pitch black because of the city lights. It was either flying really low, or it was extremely huge.  I feel stupid for not thinking about getting a picture, but I was in total shock, as I don\u2019t really believe in UFOs, or at least didn\u2019t until now, and even now I\u2019m still skeptical. I did, however, try my best to draw a picture afterwards, even though I\u2019m not good at drawing. The UFO had red lights on it. If I remember correctly, I\u2019d say about 3 of 4 of them, and I believe that red light was coming from the center as well. Since I was looking up at it, all I could see was what it looked like directly underneath. It looked like the stereotypical UFO, or flying saucer, in most aspects. Besides being a perfect circle, it looked like what a mushroom looks like from underneath, whereas you can see the edges of what might be a domed top from below, and striations leading towards the center. Most of the red lights were towards th! e exterior, with the exception of the center (where the stem of a mushroom would be). Here was where more red light emitted. Two things struck me as odd that distinguished this when compared to the stereotypical portrayal. For one thing, the front of the ship had a silver section, which reminded me of a bird shape since the shape had three corners. Secondly, I think that there may have been a protrusion at the base of it, which logically made me think that maybe somebody was playing a prank and it was actually some type of blimp because of how it glided forward, but it seemed much too big to logically call it this. There was no logical explanation for what happened. I went back to the apartment building and called my grandpa to tell him what I saw because I felt like I needed to tell someone that wouldn\u2019t make fun of me. I made this call at 6:34P.M., and stepped through the back door of the apartment complex. I was partway into the conversation when I saw the object again flying over the apartment building, even though I thought it had already passed. At this point a passerby was walking down the sidewalk and saw me looking in shock up at the sky. He then saw the object too and said that it \u201csure is a wide airplane\u201d. (He didn\u2019t see it until it was going off into the distance.) I said that \u201cwas definitely no airplane.\u201d This second encounter lasted until 6:37P.M., so it was three minutes long. This second encounter took place on Porto Alegre Street, and again the object continued moving in the same direction until it got past the river, where it ascended up and disappeared into the sky. A girl walking a ways behind me during the first incident didn\u2019t bother looking up because she thought it was a helicopter and was busy texting, and was shocked when I told her what I saw. I was kind of angry that she hadn\u2019t looked up and I was the only one that saw this the first time, but I extremely glad that someone else saw it the second time to prove that I wasn\u2019t the only person that saw it. By the way, the IUPUI campus apartments are near the Ronald McDonald House, which is not far from the hospital. This area is extremely easy to find on Google Maps, however, for some reason it doesn\u2019t show Porto Alegre, but the street that the UFO went across to get to the river is White River Pkwy E.

I saw the object for maybe 2-4 minutes, and the time was between 8pm-8:30pm.   The craft seemed large, and it was maybe a mile or so from where i was. I only saw the lights of the craft, I never saw any body to it.  The lights on the craft, which were white and there was two lights which did not change color.  The lights were close to each other, and appeared to be just a straight line. It was about maybe at a 40-45 degree angle from where I was standing. The reason I was watching this was because it was moving pretty slow, slower than a man made aircraft, and the lights were not blinking like planes, helicopters, etc usually have.  The lights also seemed like they were flickering a little ! at times but neither light was ever turned off.  It traveled east and it stopped after slowing down slightly, then stayed in the same spot maybe 3-5 seconds, then the lights became a little brighter.   After that without turning around it went the way from which it came, and now i could see a third white non-blinking light which was the same size and color as the other two. These three lights made a triangular shape. After starting back from the way it came, the craft was going maybe two to three times it's original speed. My view was blocked by a tree in the distance, about a minute after it starting going back from the way it came.  Then after that my view was blocked because of buildings and trees etc in the distance. I do not know if there were any noises or anything because there were bands practicing around us, and lots of people talking. I did not see it again after that for the rest of the night. P.S.

Before the sighting, I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star going to the right, or east side, of the road.  Whether this has any connection to the sighting or not is unclear.  After driving for about 2-4 minutes I noticed the lights through the trees on the same side of the road as the shooting star.   Thinking that it look rather odd, I continued looking in the direction until I passed by a field where there was a clearing in the trees. I was about 10-15 miles from the city at this time. At that point, I could clearly see that there were 5-6 amber colored lights, almost in a Z formation.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone camera but the lights were too faint to show up.  They appeared to be traveling southbound and I could not tell at what altitude, as there was no prospective on what I was seeing.   As they passed to the right of me, each light faded from the first to last and I couldn't see them anymore.  As I was looking, I noticed there was a cloud that was illuminated by the moon so i kept watch until I spotted them again.  They were no longer emitting any light, but I could see specks in contrast to the illuminated cloud.  They were not connected in any way, and were independant of each other. After realizing what i had seen, and the close relationship with landing aircraft, I did contact the TSA office at KIND.  They said that there had been no reports of anything that I was describing and that it would be noted.",

For a second I thought it was an airplane because it seemed so large and we do live near the airport. I exclaimed to my friends to observe the object, I really thought it could be a plane crashing. By the time they turned to face the object, it had already disappeared behind one of the houses. I was scared, and they could tell I was scared. I don\u2019t think anyone else saw it, someone said it could have been a shooting star. I think it was too large to be a shooting star. The object came by and went too fast for me to determine how far away it was. The object looked about the size of an airplane when it is closing in for landing. The flash I saw from it was white in color, but there seemed to be flames coming from behind it as it fell down, also white in color. I never heard a crash or anything of the sort and part of the reason I got scared was because I was expecting some sort of noise. I was thinking it could have been a meteor or space junk, but I was unsure if those would make a noise since the object I saw seemed so close and large. Bottom line is I don\u2019t know what it was and was wondering if anyone else had seen it.",

The craft moved much faster than an airplane, and even faster thatn jets I have seen in air shows.  It stopped abruptly in the sky over the north side of 465.  The craft stayed stationary for at least two minutes, until it left my field of vision (in a hurry to get home).  The craft had two white blue blinking lights, very similar to the light you see coming from a satellite. This craft obviously was not an airplane, as it was too fast and the lights were blinking in an erratic pattern.  The two lights were not coordinated in their blinking.  I felt compelled to watch the blinking of lights, even though I was driving.   After about two minutes of watching I started to feel dizzy and disoriented. This report is being filed two days after the fact.  Typically I would not mention something like this. However I can't seem to get this strange blinking or the image of the craft out of my mind.",

I reached a stop sign, which happened to be in front of where the light was and I got a clear view at it this time, no longer blocked by trees.  Right then and there I noticed it was shinning bright white light with a different form. The light was brighter on some areas. No other lights.  Just white light and the shape.  It was not a disk shape nor cone or anything that has been seen in pictures. It just stayed there for what seemed to be 20 seconds.  I was trying to pull my cell phone to try and take a picture and I realized, I was still at the stop sign so, I decided to make a left turn to continue my path seeing as there were cars behind me.

I made the left turn at a very slow pace while still looking at it.  Few seconds later, it seemed to have shrunk in size.

I went outside to get my sons drink out of my car and I looked up in the sky and saw a large flat object with a curved top flashing red and white lights.   The lights were very bright and blinking in a fast motion.   The object was a lot larger than an airplane and the lights were a lot brighter.  I stared at it for a couple of seconds before yelling for my son to come out and see it.  As he ran out the object seemed to slow down for about 10 seconds and then proceeded to go continue in the northwest direction at a fast speed. It vanished and we couldn't see it anymore.  Afterwards I looked at 3 airplanes that was no where near as big or as bright as this object was in the sky.  Compared to an airplane it was about 30-50 airplanes put together in comparison. This happened around 9:12 pm Indianapolis, Indiana.",

      "story": "Metallic disk observed in the sky in broad daylight I was working with my brother, who owns a commercial HVAC company, at a site that contained an old communications tower and a building that housed communications equipment.  The site was being prepped for demolition and we had the task of removing air conditioning units.  It was a warm summer day, partly cloudy, with no rain in the forecast.  We had decided to take a break and I decided to lay back on the hood of the truck to relax, looking up into the sky.  While looking at the clouds and daydreaming, that's when I saw a disk-shaped object move laterally from behind a cloud.  It was a metallic disk and appeared dark on the bottom, with no sound, no lights, no trails.  It seemed to hover in place for a few seconds, then it moved back behind the cloud.  It then began to reappear and disappear behind a cloud several times within a span of 15 seconds.  It appeared that it was playing a cat-in-mouse game with any observers below, using the cloud as cover.  Not b! elieving what I was seeing, I decided to sit up and rub my eyes, and try to come to terms with what I was witnessing in broad daylight, and in plain sight.  After taking about 15 seconds to collect myself, I decided to lay back down and look for the object again.  It took about 10 seconds since the clouds were drifting fairly quickly that day, but I found it again, still moving in and out from behind the cloud.  As I continued to watch, it finally did not reappear from behind the cloud after viewing it for approximately 20-30 seconds.",

And all of a sudden coming over one of the tall trees I see a huge and very bright orange/red light and it was about as big as the full moon but it was moving my way and from behind it came another and then another, and another, like bullets shooting out and I'm standing there thinking and saying out loud to myself what in the world is this!  I thought maybe weather balloons or hot air balloons, or parachutes.  I just didn't know and still have no idea. I looked around to see if anyone else was out and of course there was no one but me and my little Shit-zu, who could care less and I've never seen anything like it.   There was no sound and as the bright orange/red ball of light traveled it got higher and dimmer until you could finally tell that it was a boomerang shape and the intensity of the color diminished to an amber sort of glow until finally they turned black, but you could still see them flying across the sky, just like you can see a bat in the sky at night.   I saw 3 of them end up flying side by side and I ran to get my camera but by the time I got back outside they were so high and almost gone that they look almost like nothing but a joke, but believe me it's not a joke and these things were something!  You can only see 2 of them from the picture I was able to get and you can see one is more brighter in color than the other because this is how they went in intensity.  I so wish that I would have had my camera on me and been able to take the picture when they first started out because believe me that had my complete and full attention.

I was watching the sky just west and a little north of us because I thought it was unusual to see 7 jet airplanes flying so closely in the same area of sky.  I know they are farther from one another in the sky, but from the ground they looked very close to one another.  Still odd to see them so bunched up considering how vast the sky is!   It seemed as if they were confused, or that some air-traffic controller must have fallen asleep on the job.  My son agreed and as we watched the last two planes intersect safely there appeared a white light in the sky just above them.  At first glance I just thought it was a star. My son saw it too and it dawned on us that it wasn't there before!  We watched for a about 15 seconds and it moved a little, turned red, and simply vanished!  The rest of the evening I watched the sky for any other unusual happenings. I stayed up until 2:30 am and nearly everytime!  I went outside I noticed one strange reoccuring thing-all air traffic was bunched up in the same manner as earlier in the evening.  We never see so much air traffic out our way in the first place, so it just seems odd to see 3 to 7 planes all in the same patch of sky multiple times throughout the evening.

      "story": "Spherical orange lights seen in western sky by family of 3 in Indianapolis Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2013 7:30 p.m. ET  My husband, son and I were traveling south in our car on Keystone Avenue in Indianapolis, Indiana. The sky was perfectly clear and very light, as the sun was just setting. We turned west onto 38th Street, a six-lane-wide street with a clear view of the sky nearly down to the horizon. As soon as we were on 38th Street, we saw four lights in the western sky in front of us. Each light was round, orange, and approximately four to five times the size of Venus, which was also visible in the western sky.  Their position in the sky appeared to be approximately 15 to 20 degrees to the right of Venus.  The lights were arranged in a straight vertical line, like a column.  The lights were the same distance from each other, and as we continued to watch them, the two bottom lights moved laterally to the left away from the two upper lights while still holding their position relative to each other, one on top of the other.  Then the two bottom lights moved back beneath the top lights, still keeping the same distance between each other.  Then the bottom lights seemed to sink toward the horizon while the top lights seemed to move upwards in the opposite direction.   We continued to drive west on 38th Street while my son and I took photos with our phone cameras.  Suddenly, all four lights seemed to flatten out, changing in an instant from round, star-like orbs to flat, horizontal streaks.  This happened so quickly that there was no discernible process of change--the forms just appeared different, though the new shapes were the same orangish color and retained their positions relative to each other.   We drove off 38th Street into the 100 Acre Arts Park of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and stopped the car in an effort to see better, but by then the sky had darkened and the flat, horizontal streaks faded rapidly. As we scanned the sky for the shapes, we then saw two streaks of white moving rapidly across the sky in the same path as the shapes.  As the white streaks continued moving, we saw that they were contrails from airplanes.  We could see the dark forms and the blinking red and white lights of the planes as they flew overhead. I Googled \"UFO reporting\" on my phone and found the number for the National UFO Reporting Center.  I called and reported what we had seen and am submitting our separate reports of the sighting as instructed. My husband, son and I all witnessed this sight together, and we agreed that it was unlike anything any of us had ever seen before. Submitted by L. On Tuesday October 8, 2013, my wife, stepson, and I were traveling west on 38th street in Indianapolis, Indiana.  When we approached 38th and Fall Creek, I looked in the clear Western Sky. It was approximately 7:30 p.m. and that's when I noticed four lights in the sky. They were in a vertical formation, with what I would guess from the ground looked like they had about 100 to 200 yards between them.  We began following these lights.  Two of these lights smoothly and suddenly began to float in a horizontal pattern and headed southwest.  As the sun set, the lights became more difficult to see, almost as if they were cloaked by the sunlight. We followed the lights to the 100 Acre grounds of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.  It was there that my wife called the National UFO Center, and we were told that a similar phone call had been made only moments before from Pennsylvania, and the caller had reported seeing these lights in the Western sky. Submitted by K. It all started as my mom, stepdad, and I were driving home from my grandmother\u2019s house. We were all having a jolly old time in the car, discussing various subjects like school, politics, and dreams.  As we were heading close to the road that leads to my stepdad\u2019s house, my mom suddenly jumped up and shouted \u201cLOOK, UP IN THE SKY!\u201d I thought she was crazy until I put my glasses on and saw four orange-ish lights floating in unison.  After I saw them, my stepdad finally noticed them as well.  Right after we acknowledged their existence, two of the bottom-most lights began to fly left horizontally.  It was then that we realized that these HAD to have been UFOs. We started following the lights but to no avail.  The closer we drove to the lights, the darker the sky became, and eventually the two remaining lights disappeared on the horizon.  We stopped near the Indianapolis Museum of Art to look up, but still nothing could be seen.  It was then that my mom called in the UFO hotline and reported our findings.  What intrigued me the most is how the operator mentioned someone in Pennsylvania reporting the exact same sighting as us mere minutes before we called in. Submitted by A.",

Every time I went to a different location, the craft was still following me, staying still when I didn't move.  I put on some glasses, looked closer, and realized that it wasn't just a single star (there weren't any stars), but rather an actual spacecraft, with a red light on bottom and a green bluish one on top.

It has rectangle LED style light all under the wings.  At some point those lights turned off to like make it look like a normal aircraft.  But it was very high up to where if it was normal lights I wouldn't be able to see it because those lights would of been turned off at that altitude.    The other ship I saw looked like a mother ship that you would see off the movies.  It had no lights and I had to look and stare at it to see it.  It did not move and it just hovered at a high altitude.  It looked black and it was like a cylinder shape with massive size wings.  I  was talking to a friend on Skype and I went out there for a second time to turn on my cam.  He saw the mother ship style thing.  Then that is when I saw the second ship that I talked above above.  The wings of the LED style craft looked to leaned back to be a normal aircraft.  The mother ship style thing looked MASSIVE at that high altitude.  I would guess it would be at a altitude of around 30 to 50 thousand feet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

We got up and tried to look out our window we couldn't see anything so we went out back and looked at the sky.. We didn't see anything right up above even though the sound sounded like it was above or very close to the house.  We looked to our left and down the street.  We saw the UFO hovering near the next street over near the street light.  It was very bright.  The light coming from it was white.   It hovered there for a good 2 minutes.  We had it on video but the phone it was on was stolen sadly. The weirdest thing was how fast it disappeared.  It went faster than the speed of light it was gone within a blink of an eye.  I have never seen or heard a sound like that ever before.   After I watched the video and the way it hovered was like nothing I know of that the USA or anyone has invented.  I don't know anything that can disappear as fast as it did either.  It was round but wasn't flat.  Have not seen any after that.

I heard a fighter plane type sound approaching us but didn't see anything.  About 3 seconds later I see a fighter plane coming from the west heading northeast. The fighter plane was traveling very low and very slow.  If I had to guess I would say 2,000 feet in altitude.  I told my son and my friend \"look it's a fighter plane\".  We watched it for about 8 seconds as it flied by directly above us.  Then a large gray object approached the fighter plane from the rear at a very fast speed.  The object had no navigation lights like the fighter jet had. It only had 4 very dim bar lights between the main body and the wings.  I thought it was going to crash into the fighter plane.  It slowed down suddenly about 3 plane lengths away behind the fighter plane. It followed the plane for about 5 seconds.  Then the object gained speed, made a hard right, and then a hard left, cutting off the fighter plane.   The object could be seen more clearly when it turned because it banked left. Then you could tell that the object was shaped like a stingray without a tail.  It was gray and about 12 times larger than the fighter plane. 4 dim bar lights on each side where the wings joined the main body.  The wings were not fixed.  The wings rippled at opposite rhythm like a stingray.  The object took off heading northwest very fast.  The fighter plane gained speed and continued northeast.  2 seconds later another fighter plane coming from the west followed the path as the first plane but traveled at a faster speed.",

Starting around 1:00 am each date.  They are circular in shape and \"big\" with lights all the way around flashing and blinking red, green and white.  These things hover for 15 to 30 min's then take off.  I saw it first and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  My husband is a skeptic, so I woke him up to see it!!  It isn't an \"Airplane\" he said, as Airplanes could not hover for that long!  Too big to be a helicopter.  I tried to get pictures with (3) different cameras, but they wouldn't capture it.  Also tried my movie camera, but NOTHING!!  Last night, the 23rd there were (2) side by side of the same size...\"BIG\"!  If they were regular aircraft, they would have crashed.  I live in a community of 71 houses, haven't had the nerve to ask if anyone else might have seen anything!",

I was sitting in my back patio having a cigarette and all of a sudden the circle orange globe objects, 2 of them, appeared on my right hand side in my peripheral view, I turned and followed, they were moving in unison and on a parallel, straight line target. I was surprised and immediately got out of my seat and walked backwards while keeping my eyes on the objects, which were moving from south west to north east, with no noise and as I got further out in my backyard the objects slowed down as I observed them, and them me, and then they slowly started to increase in speed and move in the direction to the north east.   I then decided to run inside and get my cell phone but by the time i got it they had moved from the side of the house to the front on the house and I ran inside to go through the house to go out the front door, as I did I shouted my wife, she and the kids came out and we all stood out front of the house.  The objects had moved off into the distance by this time and only one of them could be seen far away above the tree line.  My wife confirmed she had seen one that was still visible.",

He had mentioned earlier that he had been seeing a lot of military helicopters around lately, so we thought at first that it may have been a helicopter.  But it traveled at a constant, relatively slow speed.   As we watched, it appeared to be some kind of fire, and after it reached a certain point in the sky, it seemed to stop.  I thought I saw it move around a little bit, but it could have just been an illusion because it was dark and we were near the downtown lights.  After hovering near the same spot for about 30 seconds, the \"flame\" got dimmer and dimmer, and then seemed to disappear or get extinguished. I have never reported a UFO sighting before, and though I do believe they exist, until tonight, I have never been so perplexed as to what I saw and then watched disappear in the sky.   I'm a 29-year-old cell phone salesman, and my friend volunteers at homeless shelters and lives by himself.  He's 23 and has Parkinson's and is unemployed.

Responding to a YouTube video,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcMKJbbkgok   I posted the following comment:  July 4th 2016 - We saw them in Indianapolis, Indiana.  I believe they are military drones that detect radiation emitted from possible nuclear devices or dirty bombs all around the country. Apparently people see them in every major population center around the USA.  I say, \"Good job military, I appreciate the protection.  Thanks for keeping us safe!\"  They seemed to be on patrol.  We would see them in one area of the sky, then they would move off and disappear and reappear somewhere else. Very impressive.  I can't rule out the possibility that they could be UFOs, but with the threat of terrorism on a holiday like the 4th of July, it's just my sense that they were \"ours\".  Obviously must be a secret military program. In the check boxes below, nothing applied.  The object(s) themselves glowed orangish red.  They seemed to be basketball or beach ball sized.

I know that we are not the only ones living in the universe.  However coming in contact with something not from here is very eye opening.   I was laying down in my bed, there is a dog in our neighborhood who was barking.  There is a window right above the head of my bed.  I see a light out the corner of my eye.  I turn my head to look and there it was:  A large bright orange orb.  I couldn't even say it was a plane or a helicopter.  It was close enough that I could see exactly what it was.   I got scared, ran downstairs to wake up my 73 yr old mother.  I can't get the image out of my head.  This happened at 4:00 am,  it was still completely dark outside.

One evening back in 2000, I decided to go for a drive; it was about 3:00 am.  Everything was fine.  It was a nice night out and I had the windows down on my car. I decided it was time to head home so I turned down 25th Street, just off of German Church Road. I passed over a small bridge when I saw a triangular-shaped object hovering over a small field.  From the car I could tell there were three dome-shaped windows on two sides of the object and another one off the bottom of the craft.  Lights were on inside. There was a small farm house between me and the UFO so I decided to go just past the house to get a better look.  When I got to where I should have been able to see it better, it was gone.  I didn't see it leave. I didn't see it disappear; it was just gone.   I spent the next minute or two looking around for it, but it was nowhere to be found. A few days, maybe weeks, later as I was watching TV, there was a show (Unsolved Mysteries) that was doing an episode on UFOs.  During this telecast I saw, for the first time, mention of the same craft as I had seen just days before.  It was then that I knew it was real.

Curiously I stayed until it was out of sight then right as I was about to turn around I saw another one coming from the same area where the first one had come from.  So I waited for that one to pass but before I knew it I was there for over 45 minuets just watching these objects go from one side of my window to the other.  Finally I had gotten tired of waiting for another one after about the 15th one so I headed to bed. There was a gap between the 15th,16th and 17th ones.  Around 1:55AM, I went to lay down in bed whenever I heard the noise get louder.  Two of the objects flew close to each other a! nd stopped.  About 15-20 seconds later they left one going one way and the other the other way.  I thought it was finally over until I heard the noise coming back again, but shortly after that, a train came at 2:02AM, and after that train, there were no more flying objects that were seen.

However, as I continued to gaze, the object didn't follow the typical Japanese lantern pattern. An interesting few things happened, as I intently watched the object.  The object seemed to be watching the fireworks the neighbors were shooting off.  Then in a split second, the object dropped down vertically and straight back up to its location.

Working on the Campus of IUPUI in Indianapolis, Indiana, on the 4th floor of the BS building looking directly West.  There is always a considerable amount of airplane traffic as the Indianapolis Airport is SW of this location.  That day I counted nine aircraft that where visible due to the atmospheric change that causes water vapor contrails.  As I counted two aircraft appear to be headed toward each other at different altitudes.  I thought it would be interesting to record a video.  In the video you see me raise my Iphone clearly seeing the bell tower in the center of campus as I point the phone to the sky you see the reflection of the office window glass and just after that I zoom in on the two jets (at the 7-8 sec mark) you see the UFO cross the path below the jets from right to left at a tremendous rate of speed.  At the 9 sec mark, you see similar object cross the same path at a higher altitude.  (it appears smaller) I never saw the objects until I watched and slowed down the video.  The objects appears oval and potentially reflective to the sunny day.  The motions where great speed from right to left.  In watching the video I was shocked as I didn't see the object when I first created the video.  I would have never had seen them if it wasn't for the fact I wanted to see how close the two jets were getting.  I lost sight as the objects went out of range.",

It continued for at least five minutes, and I finally went out in my pjs and stood on the driveway at the back of our cul de sac.   The sky was whited out and nothing could be seen visibly in the sky.  The sound, however, was like massive engines that had tones (f and g above middle c, half note measures) and underneath those tones was a low infrasound engine tone that sounded like low heavy steady wind.  It was Extremely loud and ongoing and I kept wondering why no one else had come out of their homes to see what the source was.  The Only thing I could come up with is perhaps it was a Massive cloaked mothership and or a fleet of same, flying low and slow.   It kept up for at least 20 minutes and then finally started fading off and I could hear it in the distance, it seemed to be heading southwest as far as distance sound.  I'm wondering if perhaps other have heard this.",

      "story": "Low flying huge disc spotted in Indianapolis, IN, 1963, by a group outside at dark. A small group of neighborhood teenagers were outside in the early evening just talking and hanging out.  All of us spotted a rotating object approaching low but with no sound.  It stopped directly over us.  It had green lights revolving around it; hovered, and then sped off.  I was 17 years old; now retired and living in Colorado.  This has bothered me for 56 years.  One of the other people who saw it became my husband several years later, is an MD and very high up in the Air Force when he retired.  We reported this to the Indianapolis airport and was told we probably saw nothing.  This was definitely not a joke to us - scared us all pretty badly.  I was an educator for 30 years; all of our group became professional people.  From that day forward, I became a complete believer in UFOs as I witnessed one and will never forget it.",

      "story": "Strange rotating lights seen over Indianapolis Airport Hub I was returning to work after getting food on 11/28/19 around 23:50 hours and noticed 4 to 5 lights rotating in a counter-clockwise formation equally spaced apart from each other in a diameter.  The lights while rotating would zoom into the center and then back out to the exact distance they originated from above the Fed Ex Hub at the airport (Above the control tower from the perspective to my location). The clouds were low hanging, no craft was visible.  I thought that it was strange to be seeing that but also that it had to be some sort of ground light making this effect. I  asked my senior officer about this on 12/2/19 and he stated that there is nothing that would produce that over the hub.  I have not seen the pattern before or sense.  I then searched the internet and located this reporting site that also has a claim of strange lights in Indianapolis roughly 15 to 20 minutes after the time I had observed them.",
