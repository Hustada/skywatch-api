I am guessing that they were located over Chandler or the Queen Creek area. I have always viewed them at around 9:00 at night around 5 times since February of 2004. The last time I saw them was September of 2005.  My father used to be a pilot for many years and he too is unsure of what they are. He knows  that they are not flares since they stay at the same elevation for the entire 20min or so that they are in the sky and no smoke. When they disappear they simply blink out. I usually see a minimum of 2 lights parallel to one another, but I have seen 3 before.  I had never intentionally looked for these lights, each instance I just so happened to see them. I wish we knew what they were, but who knows if we will ever find out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

      "story": "Glowing orange sphere spotted hovering and performing angular flying at various speeds. On 04/15/2008 I was leaving work at approximately 11:15 P.M. from a restaurant I work at in Chandler Arizona.  As I was waiting outside for my wife to pick me up I noticed a spherical orange glowing ball in the south sky at roughly a 40-degree angle from my position. The sphere appeared to be at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The object was hovering and appeared to be wavy like the surface was hot. The look was similar to magma and distorted like the surface of hot asphalt.  The object did not have what looked like conventional lights on it, but rather the whole object seemed to give off an orange fluorescence. After the object hovered for about 4-5 seconds approximately 2 miles to the south, it bolted off directly north, passing overhead and stopping about a half mile north of my location.  Again the sphere halted to an immediate stop and hovered.  When directly overhead the object appeared to be about the size of a house (1,500 square feet) the object at this point was at about a 120-degree angle.  The object traveled that distance in about 2 seconds.  The object then sped off at a 90-degree angle and immediately stopped again.  The object would not slow down and come to a stop, but rather come to an instant stop.  While accelerating the object would maintain a constant velocity and achieve its maximum speed at the instant of its movement from a stop.  After hovering in its location, the object bolted off to the N-NW in an upward 45-degree angle, disappearing from sight in less than a second. The object while in motion about 5,000 feet high was traveling a speed of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 MPH.  When the object sped off into the sky the final time, its speed was at least 4 times faster then its previous speeds.  The whole sighting lasted about 10-17 seconds.",

      "story": "pulsating UFO sighted in Arizona, USA. BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON OBSERVER:  I have been, for quite some time, extremely interested in the contents of our universe.  Of course, aliens being one of these things.  Ever since young age, these potential entities have perplexed my mind.  There were points in my life where I was almost literally addicted to the investigation of these phenomena.  ACCOUNT:  I witnessed, for the first time, a UFO at approximately 4:00 AM on the date of May 24, 2007 in the city of Chandler, Arizona.  Not being able to sleep, I decided to do some stargazing in the front of my home.  The object, which first appeared to resemble a star, moved at a steady rate.  The pulsating of light (which appeared to be spontaneous), was one of my determining factors that this was some form of advanced technology.  The UFO seemed to move at an almost constant rate of speed toward the southern hemisphere.  Then, in abrupt fashion, the object disappeared.  Almost immediately after I lost track of the UFO, a helicopter passed by overhead.  Do these two have any correlation to each other?  I\u2019m not sure, but I think it is definitely worth mentioning.",

PD)) Colorful, flashing spheres in the Chandler, AZ night skies on 10/05/07 My sister has been observing what she called an object or colorful orb in the SE Chandler, AZ night sky for weeks now.  Each night she observed this through binoculars & the object appeared like flashing red, blue, green & white lights & even honeycomb shapes appeared on this object. On various nights this object could be seen in the NE & S Chandler, AZ sky. Tonight, Friday, Oct. 5th, 2007 at approx. 9:15 pm we saw the object from my house in Chandler in the due north sky. This object is definitely not a star as we\u2019ve never seen or heard of stars being colorful or that move. Our planet doesn\u2019t rotate that quickly. We observed this object with both binoculars & a telescope. We noticed the object was moving rather slowly but on a due east course tonight. The colors were absolutely brilliant & something none of us have ever seen before. Not only was it colorful & sphere-shaped but it seemed to rotate, spin, & turn sideways. It also would move just enough for us to lose sight of it from our telescope without us moving the tripod. We wanted to know what this thing was, so we came in to look up anything we could find on the internet that might relate to this object being seen by others & we found nothing.  At 12:15 am we went back out to see just how much further this object had moved, when we were amazed by the fact that not only had this object moved further east, but there were two additional objects exactly the same as the one we\u2019d been following all night in a perfect triangular formation. They were not there prior to the earlier observation! We observed all three of them & all were exactly the same. One might say that they were hovering, but you could see them move slightly & yet all remained in perfect triangular formation. We really got a little freaked out, besides being cold & we came back in again. So this was going on for over 3 hours & then some! They are still out there very visible even now.  Has anyone else seen anything like this before, or know what is going on in our skies?    Inquiring sisters want to know Chandler, AZ",

It appeared as though the object was dipping in the forward direction because the light in the rear was somewhat higher.   All the lights were the same color as I has seen on the reported Phoenix Sighting several years ago.    I turned right on Lake Street (west) at the next intersection.   The lights were still there but the rear light was no longer visible.  I sat in my car and watched the lights for a couple of minutes.  They appeared to be dropping to the right, and my visibility was being blocked by trees.   I turned around and went back to Alma School Rd And turned south and went to the next road by the Safeway Shopping center,  just north of Chandler Heights Rd.  The lights were more visible again for about a minute and then it lowered out of my line of sight.   So I went into the shopping center lot went into the store to purchase a few things.   The lights were gone when I left the store at approximately 20:15.   At that time there were the lights of several planes in the area where I saw the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Because of both the location, and nature, of the bright objects, we strongly suspect that the bright objects may have been aerial flares, launched from aircraft over the Barry M. Goldwater Firing Range, located near Gila Bend, AZ.  That is what official military sources apparently reported, shortly after the event had occurred, and we have no reason to doubt that claim.

      "story": "Diamond Shaped Black Object Hovering In Chandler Field My brother confided this story to me a month after his observation. I believe 100% his story and observation as he is a very credible and responsible person. My brother who works for my company overseeing my night operations of my business got off work at 3AM. He lives in Maricopa so he travels from Phoenix to his home driving I-10. At around 4AM while traveling eastbound on I-10 as he approached the queen creek exit in Chandler he observed a dark diamond shaped object to his left rise up from a field about 100 feet and it then headed in a easterly direction towards casa grande. My brother said he was driving about 75-80 MPH and there were a few other cars on the road. He said the object made a few moves that made him think this was not a known civilian or military aircraft. It had 3-4 lights similar to navigation lights and it moved faster then his vehicle. He guessed it speed to be around 100-125MPH. He turned off his exit to queen creek/Highway 347 and proceeded on to the Town of Maricopa where he lives. He did not see the aircraft anymore once he left the Interstate freeway. I have lived here since 1996 after getting out of the military. I was in aircrat maintenance for F-14's and have been exposed to many types of military aircraft. What he described and its movements and speed along with no typical aircraft sounds associated with a jet engine aircraft or any normal chopping sounds of a helicopter type aircraft I conclude what he saw was either extremely new military technology not yet known to the general public or it was a UFO. I know there have been many unexplained events and sightings in the Phoenix area since I have lived here. Bottom line, I believe my brother saw exactly what he described as described. In my opinion, there has been to many sightings by too many people of various types of aircraft doing maneuvers that are just not known to be capable of modern aircfraft both military and civilian. Our current aircraft designs and more specifically, their power plants do not a! llow for this. Even a Harrier jet can not stop on a dime and hover, and when it is hovering, it is very loud because of the nozzel thrust it produces in the downward position. His sighting was a very silent aircraft leading me to believe it utilizes a high energy magnetic type power plant propulsion system and the earths natural magnetisym. Opposite type polarity propulsion system that have been engineered to allow for quite flight, speed, and maneuverability such as the new high speed trains technolog that use magnetics and ride on a cushion of air exist today, just not known to exist on aircraft at this time.",

      "story": "Bright Lights in vertical formation with top craft moving as another came up from below to get in formation. On August 12, 2008 approximately 8PM in Chandler, AZ  I walked out front to smoke a cigarette when I noticed 2 bright lights on the West horizon in a vertical line just hovering. I chalked it up at first just to be 2 planes coming this way in some sort of flight pattern creating an optical illusion. However, my husband walked out to smoke a cigarette and said \"Come here and look at this\". Just over the tree lines where I had seen the 2, were now 4 bright lights all in a vertical formation. I tried to logically evaluate what I was seeing but logic soon flew out the window.  As we watched these very bright lights, which were much larger than what you see on jets, the top one in formation dimmed the bright light and red and blue lights began flashing on it as it began to pull away from the vertical line moving in a Northeast direction. The craft that was moving was very low to the ground, lower than I see any jets in this area fly and the sound was different than jets. It made a noise but there was no \"rumble\" if that makes sense like a jet makes, it was rather quiet no more noisy than perhaps a car makes. The lights undernderneath and behind it were unfamiliar to us as well. As we kept watching, we then realized that this was a pattern that kept taking place. As the top one would begin to pull away from formation, another would \"appear\" to come up from beneath and get in this vertical line. We watched this trying to reason what was going on but it just wasn't making sense to us. If it had been planes in a flight pattern, logic would reason that the lights would be of different size and radiance if they were lined up behind each other. These lights looked like huge bright balls of light. My husband and I when we first saw them giggled and said \"Oh no, someone else is playing a hoax with flares and balloons\", however, as the top one moved away, we clearly saw the craft and it's flight pattern. Whatever they were, whoever they were, they were definitely craft. I lost count after watching 6 of these follow this pattern. \"That's 6\" I said to my husband, and then just quit counting at that point.  I began getting very nervous as we kept watching this take place as it appeared they began lining up in a perimeter around an area. I could see them on the horizon from the back yard, clearly to the north, clearly to the east and cleary to the west, the trees were blocking my southern view. However, as they followed this flight pattern, they appeared to be randomly stopping out on the horizon, not moving at all. Just hovering. Some we could follow moving following a rather large circle pattern on the perimeter. The red and blue lights flashing on them looked different than jets and some seemed to only have a steady red glow.This has to be one of the most bizarre things I've seen.  Within a few minutes of watching this, 3 helicopters appeared in the area and there was 1 helicopter that actually kept a distance from the line of lights, but was flying what appeared to be from an \"observing distance\".  This went on for approximately an hour with these things all over the sky. I kept thinking, someone else surely has to see this. We came in to turn on the news around 9Pm thinking that what might be happening would definitely make the news, we watched all the way through the 10PM news, but no mention. I began checking here last night to see if anyone else had reported anything, but soon realized this isn't kept in real time, so thought I'd check back this morning and there'd be a plethora of reports, so far nothing. This truly rattled me last night, I had knots in my stomach because what we were seeing was so bizarre. This went on for over an hour. There was not a single jet in the sky during this, just the balls of light and crafts and a few helicopters.  If anyone else has seen this, or has an explanation as to what was going on, please post it here.My husband and I walk out front and sit on our porch nearly every evening and have never witnessed anything like this in the past. We'll definitely be watching again this evening.",

I knew they were far away based on how fast I was moving and how the objects remained still as the trees obscuring my view of them zoomed past me as I drove by them. I saw two first.  They appeared as oval shaped amber lights.  My view of them vanished as houses obscured my view of them. I then proceeded with a patrol for work, then moved to another location. At this location about 8 miles North of the first, I again saw them; about 30 minutes after the first sighting.  This time I saw 8 or more of these large lights. The first illuminated, about 3/4 the size of the full moon in the sky.  Then many more appeared to the left, and in a sort-of strobe like way the lights on the right went out and ones to the left came on.  They also zoomed around (though never moved far) they were not stationary. I pointed it out to some residents in a pool of the community I was at.  Only one of them locked eyes on it and only saw the tail end of it.  I told them to keep their eyes open in that direction. The event occurred South of my position in Chandler, AZ.  It is possible they were South of Queen Creek and Mericopa, two nearby cities.",

First off, I am not under the influence of drugs or alcohol; and I am a rational person.  I was standing in my drive way outside my house in Chandler, Arizona haveing a cigarette and watching the stars. I then noticed one \"star\" moving across the sky and I thought to myslef, \"Its just a satellite.\" but as it was moving I notice three more following behind the one I originally saw in a vertical column behind it, at the same speed. I then thought, \"  Just more satellites...\"; but then they stopped completely and looked just like stars again.  If you call the starting point from the first \"star\" started moving as 0 degrees, and directly behind me as 180 degrees, they moved aproximetly 35 degrees to the west over the course of about two minutes.  After that two minutes, they remained still for about another eight to ten minutes before I went inside. It is entirely possible that this can be explained with rationality, but I have never seen this before in my 23 years ! of existence, nor have I ever heared of this happening before. I should also mention that I am a college student that is a Science/Engineering major, and know that this doesn't normally happen.  Unfortunately, I did not have a camera or video camera that can effectively record light sources such as stars in the night sky.",

I glanced back at my girlfriend to question the sighting as possibly a helicopter when it moved slowly east for 2-4 seconds.  It slightly flickered as if it was pulsing and disappeared into the night sky. The light source was bright red and unnaturally large to be a star or planet.

      "story": "Tear Dropped Shaped Object and Orb Cluster Observed In Arizona At approximately 6am I saw an object between east and southeast of my position.  The sun had come up over the horizon and the sky was lit up with no clouds in that area of the sky.  Initially I thought the object looked too bright, to big, and oddly shaped to be any standard object found in the sky.  There were no other visible objects in the morning sky.  The object was approximately 30-40 arc-degrees above the horizon. I grabbed a pair of binoculars to inspect further.  Using the binoculars I saw a tear dropped shaped object that was approximately 10-20 times the size of a planet when viewed through the same binoculars.  The tear drop was orientated with the largest part of the shape towards the zenith and the narrowest point of the shape towards the horizon.  The shape wasn\u2019t a perfect tear drop.  Along right hand side from the mid-point to the bottom there was a slight inward notch on the form. The object was a solid luminescent bluish white color with no interior features and fairly bright, possibly as bright as Venus maybe brighter.  Along the upper right edge of the shape the color was a little different being a very vibrant violet-blue in color, almost like light coming from a prism. I watched the object for approximately 40 minutes in this state.  During that time it appeared to move a short distance through the sky as if it was in a fixed position (i.e. Earth\u2019s rotation was moving it through the sky). I wanted to rule out any planets being in the area so I went into the house to look up sky charts.  After looking at the star charts and ruling out the possibility of any planets being in that position I returned outside.  This was approximately 6:40am.  At that time the tear drop shaped object was gone and there were two other objects in that area.  My assumption is that the tear drop shaped object broke apart into these objects, but without seeing the transition I can\u2019t say with certainty. The two new objects were approximately 3-4.5 arc-degrees apart from each other.  One was slightly below and to the left of the other.  The upper most object appeared to be a reddish orange object that changed shapes during the time that I observed.  It was approximately 1/5th the size of the original tear drop shaped object.  It brightness was significantly less than that of the tear dropped shaped object.  It kept changing shapes at one point it looked like Saturn with a ring around it, then it changed to a circle, then to half circle.  After that it appeared to rotate between circle, half circle, and an oval shaped object. The second object appeared to be a cluster of small individual white orbs.  The orbs within the cluster moved around in a chaotic fashion.  Every once in a while an orb would shoot up towards the zenith from the cluster.  It would travel for about 10 seconds or so in a slow, straight, trajectory before it faded out.  I studied the orb cluster for several minutes watching this same activity repeat itself until the cluster could no longer be seen. I then switched back to the reddish orange object.  I observed it for several more minutes.  It continued to cycle shapes, circular, oval, half circle, before I couldn\u2019t see it anymore.  The event lasted till approximately 6:55am. I have spent some time studying the daytime and nighttime sky, as an amateur astronomer.  My daytime profession is that of an engineer.",

I noticed two round lights (similar to the size of a car\u2019s standard headlight from 100 feet away, viewed at night).  These two lights were due south of the highway\u2019s bend.  I then saw that there were 6 more of these lights, all making a constellation-like formation, including these two in the middle (Total of 8 lights).  The lights were reddish-orange, with their inner light source, being a type of energy that seemed fluid-like within (molten might fit as a better description).  They were moving west at approximately 40mph to 45mph.  The lights were approximately 300 or so feet from the ground and looked fairly close.  While I was observing them, they did not drop nor travel any higher than their constant altitude.  They appeared to be between the 202 and Germann Rd. area.   I took the off ramp at Alma School Rd. and headed south to Germann Rd. where I then headed west for two miles, to see where they had gone.  All the lights were gone, except for one.  The light that was l! eft was now much higher and heading towards the Sierra Estrella Mountains, where it got slowly dim and disappeared over the course of about one minute.  I viewed this dimming from a parking lot off of Price Rd. and near W. Willis Rd.  I should also add that I had noticed a bright white blinking light (at a rate of once a second for the duration of ~10 seconds or so) that was miles away to the North.  I saw this earlier, when all the lights were still visible.  This white light seemed like an aircraft flashing its lights in the direction of these unknown lights.  This white blinking light seemed to be around the Sky Harbor eastern side flight path, moving west.  This would have been about 10 to 12 miles north of my highway position near the bend.  I have to assume there is a pilot that saw these and was signaling for some reason.  This aircraft did not change its course south.  I believe that aircraft was landing, but for some odd reason was flashing its lights in this direction.  I did not see any other planes flashing their lights in this manner.

I can't remember what time it was, but I know the date was after December 2011, as that's when I got the camcorder used. I noticed a line of horizontal lights close together just above the horizon.  I thought it was aircraft at first. But then a second line of lights rose just above the first line, moved slightly to the left, tilted slightly down to the left, and started shaking up and down.  I ran inside to get my camcorder, but it was gone by the time I got outside.  I dismissed it as an optical illusion and forgot about it. On June 5, 2012, just after 11 pm, I was standing on my front porch looking east when I noticed the same thing again.  I ran inside to get my camcorder, and that's when I remembered that I had seen this same thing before.  When I got outside and started filming, I was able to capture it, though it had apparently turned into a flashing orb hovering in the same location.  It never appeared to move and eventually just faded away.  The whole event lasted maybe 2 minutes.  It all happened in the same spot in the sky.  It was hovering 1/2 mile south of Ray Road and somewhere east of Alma School Road, though it's hard to tell how far away it was.  It was a clear night, the moon was bright and just past full, and was located about 15 degrees to the south and about 5 degrees above the object. Because I had seen this twice, and in the same part of the sky, I set my camcorder on a tripod, turned it on, and placed it on the porch around 11pm.  On June 15, 2012, I captured the object again, and this time from the start.  However, it only appears as the orb and does not first exhibit the line of lights as I had seen before.  Near the end of this second video, some lines are noticeable going into the object from the left and right side near the bottom. This has to be something explainable simply because it keeps appearing at the same time and in the same location.   Nobody else appears to be reporting it, and if I didn't have videos of it, I wouldn't be either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that the date of the sighting, indicated above, is approximate.  PD))",

I assumed, at first glance, they were stars.  He then said, \u201cthose are not stars\u201d, & when I looked again, the lights took off, going south, at a rate of speed I cannot even predict.  Faster then anything I have ever seen in the sky-They were gone.    We continued, driving south on the I-10 when we both saw these unusual, lights that were moving very slow, going north.  When they were directly over us we could see that each object was 2 lights, (I don\u2019t know if they were 2 different objects flying next to each other or 1 object with 2 lights) they did not blink but most definitely pulsed,they were a very bright, bluish light and they were going slower than any aircraft I have eve! r seen.  Two of them flew over, and when we got to the rest stop and got out we noticed the third one, flying north in the same direction as the others, same characteristics, no sound, and then it was gone.

It was 10:30 pm and we were traveling east on Elliot rd between Dobson and Alma School. Just north of Elliot at roughly 400 feet were three circular orange globes.  Two were at 400 feet one was another 100 feet or so above the two.  I knew immediately it was a technology that officials claim doesn\u2019t exist. We drove back and forth doing several u-turns while I told the kids, \"I told you UFO\u2019s were real.\" If we went more than a block or so from the spot next to the road where they were hovering they looked like stars.  At one point while heading back west on Elliot my daughter said, \"Oh dad they are real close to the ground.  OHHH DAD they\u2019re right there, I\u2019m scared.\" All of the other cars were oblivious and obviously were not seeing the objects.  I would have missed them as well except at the exact moment that we were in the spot where they were visible my son asked me, \"Is it a new moon tonight?\"  So at that moment I looked up and made the initial sighting. On our last pass I had an image of seeing myself from their perspective in my mind and I blurted out, \"It\u2019s a father with his two kids.\"   The moment I said that, the globe that was hovering higher floated up at a 90 degree angle, then instantly shot west at a 45 degree angle, then stopped in a position that made it look like a star.  We then left for their mothers as my daughter had become frightened.",

I was driving home from work in Gilbert, AZ, approximately 7:40 PM, turned left onto Alma School Road (heading south) from Guadalupe Road. After driving for about 10-15 seconds, a light in the sky to my left caught my eye.  It was travelling in the same direction as my truck, but much faster.  It immediately appeared to be something unusual as it was an orange flickering orb, flying at about the speed of a small plane, and probably a little lower. I was trying to get a better look, while not causing an accident, and finally had to pull into a small parking lot as I was now sure that this was not a plane or helicopter. After stopping, I got out of my truck and noticed there was another one behind the first.  I watched them going by for a few seconds before getting out my cell phone and taking a video.  Just as I started the video, the second one turned 90 degrees and headed east (it can be seen in the video doing this).  There was no sound whatsoever emanating from them. Only road noise is heard in the video. Looking to my left (North), I suddenly noticed that there was another one, then immediately after, three more behind the first three, in a straight line formation, all heading south except the one that broke off to the East.  The line appeared to stretch almost to the horizon.  As the line progressed south, another one headed east from the same spot that the first did.  I am not sure, but I think it was the 4th in line.  Seeing how far the line went, I kept wondering how many more would show up. Because I was trying to watch and describe what I was seeing on the video at the same time, I lost count.  The total was 6 or 7. Also, it was impossible to see any real shape to them because I couldn't see any defined edges.  It was almost as though it was \"approximately round\", with the edges constantly fluxuating. Because they were orange, and flickering, I thought that they could be Chinese Lanterns, however they were travelling at a fairly high rate of speed, and when I got home I immediately checked the current wind speed on the Internet, which happened to be zero.  I took a screen shot of this, however it doesn\u2019t show the date. I still have the video which is 2:42 and 291 MB, MP4 format.",

      "story": "I witnessed a black, cylinder-shaped UFO in Phoenix, Arizona. On 11/14/2014 at 2:15 pm, I witnessed a black cylinder shaped object floating in the sky at the Interstate-10 entrance on Chandler Blvd. in Arizona. I did not have a chance to pull over and study it very closely because I was waiting to turn left at a red light.  From inside my car it appeared to be about 1 to 2 feet in length and it was vertical. I was about to turn left (west) on the I-10 freeway when I noticed the object in the North sky sitting low and motionless above oncoming traffic.  It was definitely not a balloon.  It was low enough to tell there were no strings attached and the object looked really solid.  That is, it wasn\u2019t bobbing or weaving like a balloon. At first I thought it might have been a drone but there were no propellers or wings.  There were no lights on it that I could see.  I couldn\u2019t tell if it was making any kind of sound because I was in the car.  There were no streetlights or power lines near it so it couldn\u2019t have been attached to anything.  However, there was a street light about 20 yards in front of it and it appeared to be hovering at about the same height, maybe a little higher.   No one else seemed to notice it.  That is, no one pulled over to take a closer look.  Was this a drone? Has anyone seen something similar or am I going crazy? I\u2019ll check again tomorrow on my way home from work to see if it\u2019s still there. Although I doubt it, I drive the same route every day and this was the first time I\u2019ve ever seen something like this.  P.S. My mom has had multiple UFO encounters over the years. I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s and this is the first experience I have ever had. I\u2019m usually the smug skeptic that rolls her eyes at these sorts of stories. Maybe I should change my tune. &#61514;",

The objects seemed to be travelling back and forth, and each time they changed direction, the fire trail subsided, as if the object was changing direction and we could not see the exhaust at that time. This gave the appearance that the four objects would randomly disappear, and then reappear nearby. The objects seemed to be descending, zigzagging in the same area of the sky.  In just a few minutes, they disappeared. All we could really see was the fire trails, or exhaust plumes of the objects.  Something was obviously leaving fire trails, as they appeared very thick at the source of the trail and thin at the rear of the trail as it burned out. This area of the sky commonly has aircraft passing by, since Sky Harbor airport is nearby.  We could see the light of jets as well, but those were MUCH higher in the sky and further away.  These fire trails seemed less than 5,000 feet in the air, and less than 10 miles away from our location. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

      "story": "Four balls with flaming tails floating down slowly from the sky with directional changes On 9/20/14 at approximately 7:20pm my husband, 2 kids and myself were driving back from Casa Grande, AZ, and my husband and I saw the following:  We were driving north on Gilbert Rd. just past Ocitillo Rd. in Chandler, AZ when I saw two red/orange balls in the northeast sky quite a distance from us.  They were sitting at a diagonal from each other but too close together to be airplanes.  I pointed them out to my husband who commented that they may be an antenna tower.  I commented that it must be one crocked antenna because of the diagonal line they made instead of vertical. I dismissed them until 20 minutes later when we were on the 202 E just before the Val Vista Rd. exit.  I looked up at them and they were white now and, to my eye, looked to be about the size of the old large satellite dishes until they broke up into four separate balls about the size of basketballs.  I guesstimated them to be around 3-4 miles northeast from us and approximately 500 feet from the ground.  We pulled off to the side of the highway and watched them as they seemed to be floating down from the sky in a diamond shaped pattern.  As they were doing this each ball of light intermittently changed in brightness going between glowing bright with red flaming tails (like a comet) to dim white balls of light to barely visible.  They floated down slowly like a feather.  Each time one flared up the others did not. Also as they were coming down individually they were slowly changing direction in circular motions.  They eventually fell out of our line of sight behind buildings. They were moving to slowly with weird directional changes to be a meteor or something else falling from the sky.",

      "story": "One to seven bright orange spheres seen for over an hour in Chandler, Arizona, near the Gila River Reservation. At approximately 8:30 PM on Dec 10th, 2014, while driving home from the Phoenix farmers market, I witnessed 3 orange spheres in a triangular formation.   I was traveling southbound down Gilbert Rd, approaching the stop light at Queen Creek Rd, and the objects were to the southwest of my location.  They were solid orange and very bright.   I continued southbound on Gilbert Rd to Ocotillo Rd and they remained stationary or moved very slowly.   At 8:35 I arrived at my home near the intersection of Gilbert Rd and Ocotillo.  The neighbors across the street from my house were putting up their outdoor Christmas decorations.  I pointed the lights out, and they saw them too.  The objects had moved southwest from the original sighting, but were still clearly visible and unusually bright.  We watched them for a few minutes and I began getting things from my car.   The neighbors said, \u201cThe lights are gone,\u201d and a few minutes later, they said, \u201cThere they are again.\u201d  I stepped out of the garage to look, and snapped a photo with my phone.  This time there were two of them horizontal to the ground instead of three in a triangle pattern and they stayed lit for three or four minutes until they disappeared.   I went inside and told my father in law about the sighting.  A few minutes later, after getting my son ready for bed, I looked out the 2nd story window.  I saw that the three orange balls of light had reappeared in a straight line, parallel to the ground but were further west than before.   I ran downstairs to get my father in law so he could see them and we went into our backyard for observation.  They lasted for about 10 minutes before finally disappearing.   I finished getting my son ready for bed and sat on the couch to continue looking out the window. Around 8:55 the lights reappeared and I went to get binoculars.  The binoculars didn\u2019t help due to low magnification capability and a few minutes later all of the lights faded out.  I went back upstairs and kept an eye on the area through the window.  Then at approximately 9:00 pm two lights appeared further away than they before, so I went to the upstairs balcony for a different perspective.  I took a few more pictures with my phone.  This time they lasted for ten or fifteen minutes before disappearing.  At 9:25 a single light appeared in the same area so I went back out to the balcony.  The light had moved closer to my position from the last appearance but I still could not tell what it was.  While I was observing this light, two more lights which were evenly spaced appeared to the far right of the original light,  a few seconds later two more evenly spaced lights appeared to the left, and finally two more lights which were also evenly spaced appeared to the left the other! four. There was a total of seven lights in a straight line. There were three sets of two lights evenly spaced from each other with the original light further to the left. They were above the height of the street lights from my point of view and above the tree line in the distance.  They lasted for a few minutes before they disappeared but I managed to take some more photos with my phone.  They all disappeared at 9:31 and I went inside. At 9:35 a helicopter flew slowly through the area. I continued to look out the window for a couple more hours but they never reappeared. The objects appeared to be near the Gila River Indian community and south of the Chandler Municipal Airport.  Being a former Air force Security Police K-9 handler and living near the municipal airport I know what planes and helicopters look like.   These objects made no sound, they did not have navigation lights, they were not Chinese lanterns, or any kind of drones that I am aware of.   After doing a bit of online research I found that lights like these have been seen in this area more than once this year and sometimes they occur multiple nights in a row usually between 8:00 and 10:00. I called the Chandler Municipal airport and the Chandler police dispatcher but they had no reports of unusual activity. I will keep an eye on the sky and maybe I will get a better glimpse of the objects next time.",

But through binoculars, it looked completely black and donut/disk shaped, like a flattened basketball.  On one side (bottom?) were 3 or 4 really large circles that emitted yellow light that pulsed.  Sometimes the lights were almost invisible as the craft seem to tilt on its side.   It moved slowly to the South East until we lost sight of it.  The altitude was quite a bit lower than commercial airlines, my guess would be half that.   The size of the object, its diameter, was something like a school bus (guess).

Each of them were orange ovals with a small dark antenae like darkness within the oval. I attempted to record the object on my cell phone on the second viewing of the object. That video appears to be lost. The third attempt I was able to upload it to youtube. https://youtu.be/ixpqxQCsYjQ   The video is absent the details that were visible from human eyes adjusted to the dark.  The \"star\" was very orange and vibrant compared to the sky.  And the darkening on top of the object was noticable.  The planet next to the UFO is also not visible though I have a picture that shows the comparison with it and the local street light.",

I first I thought the white sphere was the light from a plane or helicopter.  This is common where we live.   However, as the objects got closer, I was expecting a sound but never heard any.   I kept looking at them because had never seen such glowing colored lights on any aircraft before.  They were not blinking.  More resembling glowing balloons.  Were moving way too fast to be just drifting.   I caught on video from my gf's cell but was hard to make out.  Only some of the green glowing object could be seen.  It appeared to me that they were not connected together, but more like flying in a group, with no visible pattern that I could tell.

      "story": "Strange three light object seen swooping over a field in Chandler, AZ. I am a truck driver who was driving in the state of Arizona on interstate 10 east bound between mile marker 181 and 182.  I initially noticed one circular bright light in the sky swooping down over a field then back into the sky at a high rate of speed.  As I noticed the light coming back around repeating the the same motion, I was closer to the object than before.  As I noticed the object swoop down almost touching the field only one light was on, then a second, and then a third circular light appeared.  Each light was evenly spaced in a straight line.   As this was happening, I turned my head out the window and looked back as the object was ascending back up toward the sky.  With the lights pointing up I was able to see the shape of this object. The shape of this object resembled a large rectangular wing similar to a wing on an old time wwII plane.  The side of this object opposite of the three lights had the middle part of this wing purtrud out in the center of the wing like a tab.  So that side was not completely straight,   The other side with the lights was straight with three large white circular lights in a row. I attempted while watching this to take a picture but was unable to while driving.   I have never seen anything like this during my 15 years on the road as a truck driver and wanted to report this and hopefully get a logical explanation on what this may have been. I have a sketch of this object as well that I can mail to you.
