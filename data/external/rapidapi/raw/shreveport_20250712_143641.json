He explained that it was three lights in the sky.  I interjected, \"triangle shaped?\" and he nodded, agreeing. He said he and his friend (a neighbor at the end of the drive) were outside talking last night and saw this formation of three lights. The neighbor is the one who'd taken the photo with his cellphone (don't know what kind). It remained in place for awhile and then vanished.    Neighbor forwarded the photo to my brother's phone and it was accidentally deleted. He texted the neighbor with my number and asked if he'd forward the photo to me. Neighbor did so.

      "story": "((NUFORC Note:  Source of report describes self as an \"M.D..\"  We do not know the precise dates of the alleged incidents, described below, and find it unusual that NUFORC has not received reports about the alleged sightings before now.  PD)) Multiple-type UFOs are witnessed multiple times, in multiple states, near U.S.A.F. bases in LA and CO. Several other individuals and me have been observing clandestine military \"UFOs\" for approximately five years now. Two to four distinguishable crafts have been observed during this time period. The locations I speak of are Shreveport, Louisiana area and the Denver, Colorado cosmopolitan center and Bailey, Colorado, approximately 45 miles south of Denver. Both in Shreveport and in Colorado, United States Air Force Bases are nearby. In Colorado the sites are the U.S. Air Force Academy plus NORAD within Cheyenne Mountain in and near Colorado Springs. In Shreveport, Louisiana, the site is Barksdale Air Force Base.  I will first comment on the history of others and my observations. Beginning in 2003, my brother, a friend and me began seeing large, glowing and color-changing objects over Lake Bistineau in Bossier Parish about 20 miles from Shreveport and near a very small rural town called Hall Summit. Periodically, on a darkened road very near Hall Summit, LA, my brother and I (and occasionally others brought along)witnessed several aerial crafts in the night sky and depending on the evening of observation, one or more different crafts were observed. Typically, the activity in this country area peaked in the late AM hours, before dawn. However, there was some activity as long as it was dark. The most prominent and constantly witnessed UFO was a large, bright orange oval object in the sky which was capable of hovering, moving at an variable speeds, none of which were considered to be \"high-speeds,\" as seen in LA, anyway. These identical crafts were also seen hovering above the lake named above with the same light/shape configuration and rapid color changing properties. These \"color-changers\" were discoid in shape, appeared metallic and when viewed by high-magnification binoculars They all moved from side-to-side or if viewed from directly below,they made small concentric circles as if their propulsion was possibly related to the harnessing of the earth\u2019s own (geo)electromagnetism as the movements were identical to that of two magnets of opposing poles when brought close together. The propulsion of these type crafts were silent. The most often seen color was orange, however, all colors of the visible spectrum were viewed at varying times; often the type of craft mentioned cycled through this spectrum rapidly.  The \"color-changers\" were often but not always associated with faster moving crafts we termed \"strobers\" as they displayed strobe-like qualities flashing intense bluish-white light at extremely high frequency when moving and a slower frequency when  approaching a landing area on government land, in the middle of virtually zero population. They were difficult to look upon as a prolonged gaze requires.Their propulsion was, too, silent. These crafts \"buzzed\" our vehicle at a very low altitude while stationary or when driving--multiple times over the years. I cannot comment on the shape of these crafts, due to the light intensity. These were much smaller than the above crafts that appeared at least 100-200 ft.in diameter and were rarely witnessed hovering except as they were about to land. They were capable of high-speed maneuvers such as small angle turns and abrupt stops and change of direction without deceleration. These accounts of the aerial ships seen in the country were near government owned land and is inaccessible. One evening at about 4:00 AM CST while driving on a small rural highway nearby, an orange-glowing \"color-changer\" passed over us at a very low altitude (150-200 ft. perhaps) and my bother and me were within 1 mi. of our usual observation point and we sped there, eyeing the orange ship until we reached our stationary observing position. The huge craft proceeded to land about 1000 to 2000 yards away. Two \"strobers\" buzzed by us as the larger craft passed over us toward its landing spot. Upon landing, either the orange ship\u2019s lights were turned off or it proceeded underground. Too, we had seen lower hovering crafts \"cloak\" or shutting down their lights.These UFOs seem to be of military association. Gasoline? Free energy appears to have been harnessed.  In Denver and Bailey CO, the hovercrafts (\"color-changers\") were seen yet in massive numbers, at higher altitudes and typically emanating only bluish-white light. The same small movements--as if magnetically-related propulsion was used--were identical to the ships in LA. An extremely large hoverer appeared over the same mountain peak nightly and the intensity of its white light was remarkable. It was viewed from a much greater distance (~1.5-2 mi.)and using the LA crafts as a reference,was at least 1000 feet across. In Bailey, (not seen in LA) the crafts at higher altitudes often zipped away with no apparent acceleration and, too, could stop on a dime. On an average evening, barring unfavorable weather conditions, there were 30-40 of these objects scattered in the sky. Other times there were much fewer present. They were over the urban area of Denver, also, at relatively low altitudes.  I have not returned to the country viewing area in LA for several years. Now, the same \"color-changing\u2019 discoid crafts hover over Shreveport proper, a few at higher altitudes and typically one or two at lower altitudes. The lights however appear to remain white. While hovering, if viewed from binoculars, rapid color changes are seen. Many I know have witnessed these crafts and agree they are presumably military. The last time I spent time observing one of these was April 30, 2007, with a friend, within the city, from my front porch. Their presence in the evening sky is constant. The sightings are regular yet the crafts over the city do not maneuver, they just hover and make their small nutated  movements. The fact I\u2019ve read absolutely  no reports of these highly visible \"UFOs\"  is incredible to me. They need to be evaluated by experts with the proper equipment and brought to the largely unknowing public\u2019s awareness given the potentiality for a cheap or free energy source. They are obviously higher aerial technology that has been disclosed and I feel as though they are at least partly used for surveillance/security. They fall under the definition of a UFO as they are not identified.  Two other type crafts were witnessed in the country, both similar: rectangular shuttle-like crafts heading in the direction of the Air Force base. Propulsion could be heard (a low uniform hum); these were of such a low-flying altitude (~60 ft.) that 6 (on one of these crafts) to 8 (on the other)circular propulsion devices were viewed beneath each \"shuttle.\" Windows were present on the crafts' front which were very small and rectangular. Side windows were large and square with yellow light inside seen along with human shaped figures near the windows. There were no exterior lights present on either and an estimated speed of both is 40-50 mph: an atypical, very slow speed for an object of their size and apparent weight. The rectangular humming crafts appeared 40-50 ft.long by 15 ft. wide.  The high level of activity in the region warrants investigation. I have seen the same hover-type crafts not only in the two locations mentioned but everywhere I have traveled within the U.S. I am an M.D. and a trained observer. To let this slip by without investigation would be tantamount to continuing to allowing the government and its military to fund and operate these specialized crafts without inquiry and to continue to use hidden, inexpensive propulsion, likely in most cases presented above, to be geo-electromagnetism harnessed and likely regenerated--for free.

Also I need to point out that I live close to an air force base. There are times when I've seen obvious unknown military planes and one would suspect these as being \"UFOs\". As we all know, not everything seen can be said to be from another planet.  The first object i saw was in the middle of a large amount of air traffic. I was in the backyard taking my dog out and happened to noticed how much air traffic was flying over. There are several distinctive paths where the airlines fly and over the years I've come to know where in they sky they usually are. There was plane after plane. Probably about 5 minutes apart in sightings. All of a sudden there was this one object that came across the sky in a totally odd flight path. It had lighting like what you see when several windows of a commercial plane is glowing. There was probably 8 double windows down the side. It sort of had a banana shape to it actually. There were no other lights. No red blinking light underneath. No landing geat lights either. Just these lights. It seemed to hold some reflection from the ground as there was a slight glow. Not a glow as if it were from the object, but just reflected up from the ground. It didn't really have a feel that it was flying straight either. I got a sense of a \"tumbling\" while watching it. It went over in an \"S\" shape too. It came from the north flying southwest, then southeast, then back southwest. It was wide curves and not sudden direction changes. I couldn't say there was no sound either as there was still many other planes flying over.  The second object came a few hours later. I decided to go back out to see if I could see something else. Just something you do I guess when you see an object like that. Sort of a hope that you see it again I guess. As I was looking up I noticed a \"star\" out of place straight over head. I know the constellations pretty well so I knew this light shouldn't be there. About that time I noticed it was actually moving. It was really slow. Iwas traveling from the west heading East. It's the path that I generally see satellites when they are illuminated by the sun. I had thought that's what this was too, but it was moving so slow I felt that was worth ruling out. It kept travling the same path and became dimmer and dimmer as it move toward the Earth's shadow. It was just like a satellite in everyway, just extremely slow. The complete time of seeing this object would be around 12 - 15 minutes.  Both of these object could easily have other explainations rather than \"UFO\". They are UFOs though in the sense that I had no clue what they were. I don't think any other regular average person could have said either. But I thought this was worth reporting. I would have sent info in sooner but I had teken pictures of the first object and was trying to get something to show up. I used a digital camera and had the settings wrong. All I got was a blurry dim light in one photo and nothing in the others. I tried to increase the brightness and played with the contrast but was unable to get a shape. There wasn't anything worth sending with this report.",

She stops her car at the intersection of Southland Park Drive and Normandie Drive and gets out of car.  Granddaughter, age 8, is beggin her to stay in car.  The object passed over them and veered to the left, heading west on So.Land Park Dr.  Near Sams, a fish eatery, the object suddenly disappears.  It is no where in site.  Grandmother gets back in car, turns right on So.Land Park Drive then turns left on Fireside Drive.  She pulls into driveway at 9343 Fireside Dr. to pick up newspaper in driveway.  She gets out of car, goes to back of car, picks up paper, takes! paper to carport and places it on table, goes back to car and gets in.  Backs out of driveway, car is facing south on Fireside Dr. (2nd sighting) They look up, there the object is again.  Grandmother and grandaughter can see the object from the windshield.  It is just above them, no noise.  She pulls into 9344 Fireside, gets out of car, picks up my newspaper, gets back in car.  Dials my number, call comes in at 6:18 a.m.  This is my signal to go outside and bring my granddaughter inside.  I go out, nothing unusual, go to car and granddaughter begins to excitedly tell me they have just seen a \"flying saucer\".  Other grandmother is also telling me what they have just witnessed.  I am very skeptical at this time but as I am standing there, SUDDENLY, over the house at 9343 Fireside Drive, (3rd sighting)this hugh object appears.  It has red and white lights.  Beautiful lights.  Very, very slow moving, if moving at all, more like it was hovering.  No sound or noise at all.  I as! k them if this is what they saw and YES, that's it.  They jump! out of car and come around to where I am standing and we all gaze at the object not really knowing what to do.  We watch it and then it slowly goes up Fireside Drive in a north west direction.  Other grandmother gets in car to try and see where it went.  At 6:23 a.m. she calls me back to say the thing is nowhere in site.  I called airports in the vacinity but they knew nothing and you could tell they were disbelieving of what I was telling them. Also called several other agencies to report this but no one was interested.  This was such a vivid thing in my memory, I drew a diagram of the events and wrote a timeline.  This was the morning of the meator showers and also when the sun came up, the southern sky was full of chemtrails.",

It was all black underneath, but it's hard to rember if there were other lights on which I think there were. This took place on Chase Oaks street. I think the line patterns were going from straight lines to curved lines and were connected to little bright lightbulbs. I'm uncertain how long it was there for at least a few minutes and I don't know if I was abducted or not! , but I think if I was I wouldn't have remembered so much detail from this encounter.

      "story": "Flying Triangle craft observed over Shreveport, Louisiana, on night of 27 May 2015. Shreveport, Louisiana, around 10:15 pm CDT  Duration of sighting:  5 minutes  Angle of view: 45 degrees above horizon  Estimated altitude of craft: 5,000 ft gal  Estimated speed of craft: 50 mph  A triangle shaped craft was observed flying slowly and silently over Shreveport on a northerly heading, most likely flying directly over Interstate 49 which is a north-south highway in the city. I was observing from a distance of one (1) mile east of Interstate 49 with a clear field of view, in the southeast section of the city.  Weather conditions were clear and calm. At arms length, the craft appeared to be the same size as the width of my thumb, which is an average-sized adult male thumb. I was also able to view the craft using a high-quality pair of 10x50 binoculars that gave an enlarged and more detailed view. I could not discern any distinct structure, but did observe that background stars disappeared from view as the craft passed in front of them. The shape of the craft was an elongated deltoid triangle with a single blinking red light centered underneath, and non-blinking white lights on each of the three corners. There was no green light, which is normally required on the right wingtip of all aircraft. With the binoculars, a row of three dimmer non-blinking yellowish lights could be seen along the starboard leading edge of the craft just aft of the most forward non-blink white light. I surmise that these were windows. I observed the craft as it continued to fly north of the city until if became obscured by trees on the horizon in the distance. The speed and altitude seemed to remain constant during my observation. There was no audible sound at any time. This is the sixth time in the past year that I have observed such a craft flying over my city at night, and it has always been seen in this same way, in the same place, flying in the same manner and direction. The next time I see this craft I will be prepared with my Nikon DSLR and f/1.8 lens along with my Panasonic PV-GS300 low-light capable miniDV camcorder. I am a lifelong aviation enthusiast and airplane spotter and am certain that this was not a conventional aircraft. I would welcome a reply, but am not requesting one.",
