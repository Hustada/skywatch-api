My brother and I were waiting for the school bus and we were standing inside our house behind a glass door.  So I see look up at the sky and I turn my head to the left and I see the ship zip across the house and street and stopped and hovered over the trees on the next street over and just sat there for a minute and the zipped off and never saw it again.  It was silver saucer like ship but I did see the top of the ship because I think it was camouflage or it was a small top.  I didn\u2019t see any aliens just the silver ship that didn\u2019t make any sound or make the trees mover because of how low and fast it was when it went over the trees.",

Well I would have to say the sighting was about 6 years ago or so and I had never really thought about it until a friend of mine had told me about a similar sighting near or around the same time mine took place.  My mother and I were driving back from Lancaster, NY into the city of Buffalo at about 10pm when we noticed a black triangle type object about the size of a small jet plane. Immeditaly my mother and I knew something was wrong because the object was hovering above a bunch of trees and slowly spinning in a circular motion. This made us look at it closer. We then noticed that it did not have wings of any kind, it was a solid traingle with bright white lights in each corner and a few little red lights in the middle of the object. I think what was weirdest about the object is the way it was hovering...I can't really explain it but it was like nothing I had ever seen, it was so still and moving in a perfect circle...the lights in the middle of the craft were moving in a circle also but at rapid speed.  We watched it for a bit and the more we looked the more freaked out we got and my mom decided that she wanted to drive away. We had never stayed to see what it would do next and to this day I get chills talking about it. It was really really weird.

Since the first evening my mom pointed out two strange lights in the evening sky that eventually took off at light speed, up and at an angle.  Not something a plane can accomplish, especially back in the mid seventies.  There were to white lights, kind of moving back and forth, slowly.  It would move to the right, stop, move back to it's origanl position, then to the left, and then back to it's position again.  It would do this all the time for nights at a time, when it was a clear starry night.  Finally one night when I watching it, it just shot up at an angle at unbelieveable speed and it was gone.  I never experianced it again.  I've seen lights that illuminated, in a strobe like matter, starting with a large bright white light, to a green, red, blue, back to a brillant white again.  Seen that all the time.  Mainly in the fall months when the sky was clear.  My most favorite happened in the late 90's when I used to go out almost every night just to see what I could see.  I was getting ready to head in for the evening when suddenly a black, triangler object, about the size of a small plane hovered like a kite over my head. It was triangler shaped, black, thin, it had 3 round orange lights at each corner.  It was completely silent.  When it finished going over, and I couldn't see the underneth any more, it turned on its side, so I could until it was out of sight..

      "story": "Two small, dim orange lights abruptly do a 180 turn, one engaging in eratic zig-zag motions This observation occurred at approximately 2300 hrs EDT on 5/3/07 in Buffalo, NY.  The sighting was also observed by my 26 year old son.  We were standing in a downtown parking lot (near Shea's Theater) when I spotted the bright star Arcturus in the eastern sky. As I looked at the star I noted a small (smaller than the star) object emitting dim, non-blinking orange light moving toward and somewhat above Arcturus from the south (my right) heading north.  At first I thought it must be a very distant aircraft, but its later behavior negated that assumption. \tAs this first object moved past the star, I noticed a second, identical object following behind the first, and moving just below Arcturus.  Once past the star, the top object (first one sighted) seemed to slow while the second object caught up with it.  They moved close to one another \u2013 and then completely reversed course, now moving south (toward my right).  As they did so, the bottom object engaged in a rapid up-down zig-zag pattern, which removed all doubt that these things were ordinary aircraft. \tThe two objects then flew off together, maintaining a constant separation, and appeared to circle around the city to the south, west, and then north.  We were passengers in a car with other people so finally had to quit our observations before the objects disappeared.  Again, these were tiny (compared to most visible stars), dim reddish or orange lights.  We could not make out any shapes beyond that. \tI am a PhD professor, geologist and planetary scientist.  I teach college astronomy courses and have been avidly observing the skies for over 50 years.",

Basically, I was just stargazing this night instead of using the telescope.  Orion was well to the west and setting and Gemini was in the southwest and Saturn was SSW to the right of the constellation Leo.  The condition was clear for a change and I was noting the light pollution due to an article I recently read in Sky & Telescope. Just as I was gazing near Castor and Pollux a pair of red lights set evenly apart was moving at a very fast rate from those star locations towards the east.  There was no noise.  The width these light were apart was just about the width of a finger held at arms length away from the body.  The lights remained evenly apart the whole duration.  I could not determine any kind of shape between or around the lights or if it was one or two objects. The only aircraft that was near was a plane coming from the NNE and headed south towards Buffalo and that made a definite noise.  About 12:15 or so I went inside to consult the NASA http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/ website to verify where the ISS was located, which was New Zealand at the time. The only thing I can conclude it was too fast to be a normal passenger aircraft and not quite a communication, ISS or other satellite and I have witnessed the ISS before.",

The things that interested me most was 1) It was NOT flashing. 2) There was NO sound. 3) There was no trails of any kind and NO smoke. 4) It was an incredibly bright white light that seems to be round.

I as well as my wife and a neighbor were sitting on our neighbors porch as the sun was setting. We were talking about various things when I spotted a light in the sky. It was reddish orange at first sighting and fairly bright. It was stationary to the naked eye and no other visible objects or distinct lights around it. At first I though it was Jupiter and continued to watch for a minute. I then realized that it was to close to the zenith to be Jupiter and began to think it could be Mars but I was not sure due to my not seeing a star chart in about a year and wasn\u2019t sure if Mars was visible yet. So I proceeded to my apartment next door and went upstairs to put my telescope on our porch and try to view it. As time went on the object dimmed very slowly. It was about 8:30 EDST when I got my scope out and had the object in my viewfinder. I then viewed it through my main eyepiece. What I saw looked almost exactly like Mars in size, shape, hue, and reflectivity. It appeared to have an atmosphere/clouds. The object had the orange/ red color but was not emitting the light on its own. As I stared I though what I saw next was caused by my eyes playing tricks on me. I saw a tiny point of white light orbiting the main object extremely fast in a teardrop shape around the object. If the main object were the point of a teardrop than the tiny point of light was moving in a clockwise motion as viewed through the scope. The point of light moved out towards the 10 O\u2019clock  position of the main object and went out approximately 5-8 lengths of the main object in the teardrop fashion. It concluded 1 rotation at about the 1 to 2 O\u2019clock range of the main object. One rotation was approximately 2 and \u00bd seconds. I started shouting to my wife, who was still downstairs on our neighbors porch, to come up to my scope quickly because I am seeing something amazingly not natural. It is now about 8:35 EDST and she is up with me. Whilst she was coming up though, I continued to view the object throu! gh my sc ope and noticed something amazing. I saw some form of a tether/ tractor  beam that appeared to be connecting the small point of light with the main object. The tether appeared to be the same hue of the main object, reddish/ orange, but it was very faint but defiantly there. My wife looked through my scope and saw what I saw, the point orbiting the main object, minus the tether due to her wearing glasses.  I looked back one more time and stared for about 1 minute than began to adjust my scope, as I hadn\u2019t attached either tension springs.  I attached one tension spring to the left side of the scope. When I finished that I got out a 1.25\u201d 9mm lens and tried to find the object again. I couldn\u2019t so I put on the 2\u201d eyepiece again and found it rather quickly but what I saw surprised me once again. The object had turned blue. It still looked the same as before with all the same features but it was just blue.  Also the small object orbiting had disappeared and so was the tether/ tractor beam. It is now about 8:40 and our neighbor is now up with us and looked through the eyepiece. He saw the blue object and was disappointed that it wasn\u2019t something waving at him. Well I watched it for a few more minutes  and then decided to try the higher power lens. I put the lens in and noticed right away that I had forgot to take the moon filter off and so I quick took it off. It was now about 8:43. Once I put the eyepiece back in I lost sight of the object.  I immediately ran inside and began typing this for accuracy of time/description. This is the best I can do without have the right questions asked. Feel free to contact me for anything more that I may have no added in as I didn\u2019t know the info was needed.",

Here are the event details:  my husband and teenage daughter went out to run some errands.  I\u2019m not exactly sure what time it was when he called me to see if I could see it from our house.  Indeed I could.  I studied it for a moment and concluded that it was not an airplane; I am familiar with the light patterns of airplanes, and this craft was flashing red, yellow, green and blue and seemed to be hovering in the night sky.  I grabbed my digital camera and took some pictures.  Looking at the craft with the naked eye, there were no \u201ctails\u201d, however, the \u201ctails\u201d were captured using the camera.  I then proceeded to use my digital camera to record a video of the craft.  In the video, we could see the movement: back and forth, up and down, and side to side, with no regular pattern.  My husband proceeded to tell me on the phone that he and our daughter were trying to drive to the craft\u2019s location, but every time they got close, the craft would shoot to another location within view.  Duration of sighting was at least two hours.  Only one craft was sighted, its shape was hard to determine due to the distance, but seemed to be a bright light (extremely bright) with flashing red, yellow, green, and blue colors.  Its motion was sporadic at times, but seemed to hover in the same general area in the sky.  The weather conditions were as follows: very cold (approximately -20o) with clear skies.  It was evening (after 6 pm Central time).  The next day, January 16, 2009, a relative from Mason City, Iowa called to say that their family of three also saw the object in the sky (I posted the video on the internet and sent them pictures as well).  Our teenage daughter also captured some pictures with her digital camera, showing more erratic movement and green \u201ctails\u201d.  Distance was very hard to determine since the movement was not visible with the naked eye.  I was standing at my patio doors, filming above my h! ead slig htly.  From where I was standing, in order to cover it in the sky, I would have to have held up a dime.",

I saw it first and pointed it out to my friend saying, \"is that a UFO\", and he responded that he too thought it was a UFO.   The craft then moved swiftly to the right, the movement was swift and odd to watch as it did not move like any other air craft we had ever seen. It then came to a complete stop, then it backed away until it disappeared into the sky. It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.  I no longer question the existance of UFO sightings.",

About 15 minutes later, a similar craft with 4 lights was seen moving much faster in a different direction across the sky, except this time it was a light grayish-brown shade.  Moments later, in the opposite side of the sky, 5 very distinct, very bright lights slowly glided across the sky.  These lights had a symmetrical formation and moved in and out like a flowing organism.  All three witnesses were taken by the sight, and amazed at the possibility of three sightings in a matter of minutes.  Then, about 10 minutes later, out of the center of the sky appeared two, candle like lights floating symmetrically across the sky, to the edge of the horizon.  Flowing i! n and out in perfect motion. And again these two appeared in the same way another 5 minutes later.  Next, after about 15 minutes of waiting, a single glowing object appeared on the far side of the horizon and floated behind the home, out of sight to the witnesses.  Then, to conclude the experience, 5 very prominent, bright candle like objects, floated very slowly, very low over the home.  They drifted further and closer to each other and seem to have a distinct pattern to them.  They drifted slowly across the sky, and went out of sight approximately 45 seconds after they appeared. the last event was significantly longer than any other sighting of the night.  After this, we saw nothing else and clouds rolled in from the south east.  We noticed that all crafts traveled in the direction of the stars, and each of them had a distinct, candle glowing like form.  However, the first were bright blue.",

As I passed the Hamburg Street exit (Exit 5), I noticed a peculiar light arrangement to my right approximately 1.5~2 miles away.  The lights were in a vertical alignment, like what you would see if a commercial jet banked 90-degrees.   At the very top was a pulsating white light (not flashing).  Below that were two blue lights.  Much further below (50 to 100 feet) the blue lights was a single red light. As I followed it moving away, it seemed to be a shape like a vertical cigar.  It caught my attention and I tried to keep it in view.  I but it disappeared behind some taller buildings in the city to the North.  I then drove around another mile to the Church Street exit (Exit 7).  While exiting the thruway, I saw the same light pattern over my left shoulder.  This time, it was much larger and the light pattern was now 30-degrees from horizontal.  The craft was heading southeast towards Lake Erie and was travelling without making any detectable noise.  If it were a commercial jet, it would definitely have been very audible at the low altitude it appeared to be flying.  The exit I was on is off of an elevated section of the thruway so I quickly descended to a point where my view of the craft was blocked by the thruway. I raced to get to a location where I would have a clear view over Lake Erie.  I reached an opening about 20-seconds later, but to my dismay, the craft could not be found.  In the close up view (2nd sighting), the red light was bright and not flashing.  The blue lights now appeared to be more of a blue glow like from some type of propulsion system.  I would compare it to the blue lights on the rear of the starship destroyer in the movie Star Wars. The white light was now on the far right side of the craft.",

I noticed this because of the colour and the fact that the lights were on top of each other, not beside each other like an airplane.  I watched for a few seconds when the lights suddenly changed to a bright green colour, then immediately afterwards, they changed direction on a dime and started going in the other direction. I thought this was wierd so I decided to follow them.  I drove down to a rest area beside the water about a kilometer away, and could see that the lights were directly over Buffalo, New York.  The lights floated around, changing directions quickly, going left, right, up and down and backwards and forwards.  Then the lights started going up and to the left, slowly slowing down until they came to a stop.   At this time they changed colours again back to the pinkish red colour.   All of a sudden directly below the lights another set of lights appeared out of nowhere.  These lights were an orangish yellow.  It slowly went up towards the first set of lights and then passed it.  The red lights then started moving again, following the orange lights.  Then as quickly as the orange lights appeared, they disappeared.  Then the red lights started moving closer to the water, then turned left and went deeper into Buffalo, getting smaller.  I watched this for about 2 minutes and then left.",

These bright white starlike objects were in triangle formation, flying low with a sort of tilt or plane to our view that sheared the shape of the triangle. The objects then appeared to get much dimmer as they appeared to move at an alarming speed ascending, silently and maintaing perfect triangle form. Now also more at a perpendicular plane to our view as it ascended, this triangle was a perfect right triangle, it ascended slightly northward and completely zenith out of our view due to our own rooftop. Whether it left the atmosphere is something left to question. My wife and I chased out into the streets to see if we could still see more, but other buildings and canopied trees blocked our view.",

I had never before witnessed any type of a UFO sighting before in my entire life.  I was alone at my cabin the evening of Fri, Aug 26, 2011.  I had been there all day doing some outside work, and then started a small fire in the late evening.  As my fire died out, I decided to look up at the sky for any shooting starts.  About 10 secs after I looked into the eastern sky, I did see my first shooting star.  I then looked into the western sky and I saw another shooting star, or so I thought. This star was moving west to east laterally, and then just stopped and faded out.  After about 2 or 3 secs, it got bright again, and then moved again, and again faded out. It did this at least 7 or 8 times, moving at a equal distance each time and then fading out again.  It then moved at a upward and outward angle from me, again getting very bright when it first moved, and then fading o! ut.   It then moved upward in a straight line, then stopping and fading out again. Then in moved inward and upward toward me, forming a backward letter 'C\", then it just shot straight up into the sky until it dissappeared.  I then looked at my watch, and it was approximately 10:35 pm.  I would say that I observed this star/object for about 3 mins. The stars in the sky appeared to have a blueish hue to them, but this star/object appeared to be more of a bright gray color.  Also of the 12 movements that I observed, the last 5 of 6, the object seemed to have a redish/orangeish glow to it after it moved, and then got gray again.  Like I say, I had never before seen any type of UFO in my life, but I will leave you my contact info, if need be, feel free to contact me, and I'm also very curious if any one in my area reported anything similar.

      "story": "Four dimly lit triangular objects whistle as they pass low over Buffalo, NY A friend and I were standing on the roof of a 10-story building at night, around 9:15 on December 26th (2011) in Buffalo, NY.  I noticed four dimly lit objects over the city, moving in a straight line from the direction of Lake Erie towards the northeast.  At first glance I thought these were the lights on the wings of a far away commercial aircraft, but appeared too low in the sky and were approaching too quickly. I noticed a corresponding whistling sound as they approached.  The sound was not unlike the sound from those whistling Nerf balls.  It was changing and varied, as if there were more than one Nerf ball sounding at once. It was not loud, but clearly audible.  I could then see that there were four separate objects.  They were black or dark gray, seemingly lit on the underside from the lights of the city. There was also the dim yellow light coming from each, probably coming from the leading tip of the object, because the light was less visible once th! e objects passed overhead. The four objects were flying very near to one another in a flexible delta formation. The formation was like a small flock of birds; imperfect and changing, but they were moving inexplicably quickly with no visible wings.  I noticed them just before they were directly overhead, and were out of sight and earshot within 10 seconds.  I was not able to discern the shape clearly, but my best guess would be rounded triangles, similar to the \u201cflying wing\u201d design of the F117 Nighthawk. They all appeared identical to one another. As they passed, the sounds diminished accordingly, and I quickly lost track of them in the night sky.  Both my friend and I were duly creeped out and went back inside immediately.",

At 5:13 pm 5 miles south of Buffalo, MO,  I was outside with my gps and heard a very loud noise that made me think a military jet was passing within site of my location.  After stepping into a location where I could see a larger section of sky, I finally located a sillhouette of what would appear to be a passenger 747 at standard crusing altitude for commercial traffice in the area.  This had no visible contrail and compared to a typical passenger jet appeared to be flying at around 3 times a normal jet.   Based on the altitude the jet could be heard as well, very loud as well as clearly which was unusual in this area, much less at that volume. Based on my normal views of airplanes this should not have been heard, again it was the sound that caught my attention to begin with thinking a military jet was approaching as I had seen f-14's in the area a few days prior.   My cell phone has a compass on it and after tracking the object for approximately 10 seconds by sight it dissapeared much quicker than any 747 at that altitude I had ever observed.  I had aproximately 20 seconds of hearing something approach and 10 seconds of visual on the jet.  Using my compass, it was headed at aproximately 225 degrees sw of my location. I know this doesn't fit into a typical report, but the whole scene did not fit the general feel of a typical 747 commercial jet , altitude, sound and speed of what you would normally think. If it can be determined this was a normal commercial flight, at least maybe weather patterns and temperature etc would help identify other things that you get reported.",

      "story": "6 orange reddish, flashing lights,  slowly coming off the horizon joining in formation \tLast night at about 8:30 p.m. is when the event took place. However let me start by saying  the original object I observed has been in the sky for months. I first spotted it in March, looks like a bright star, only its strobing and blinking different colors. I grabbed my friends cheap telescope,  got it in view, and once the object was in focus, I was shocked to see it was 4 lights in a straight line, evenly spaced(also nothing was flashing, as appose to out of focus). I was very surprised and exited, as I\u2019m very into this type of thing, and always wanted to personally witness something. This got me very interested in this \u201cstar\u201d , and anytime I\u2019d be outside at night I\u2019d look for it. As said, I\u2019ve observed it for months now parked in the same spot moving across the sky with the rest of the stars, like nothing irregular(other than the strobing lights) and was there the whole time until yesterday.  Sorry for the little pre -story but I felt it was necessary  \tSo last night around 8:15 I started walking to my buddy\u2019s house to hang out, and as always when I\u2019m walking, I look for my star. I take a look at it in the gaps between trees and houses.  As I\u2019m nearing my friends house I see there\u2019s now 2 of the strobing stars next to each other.  This other one hasn\u2019t been there any other time I look. As I get to another gap where I can see the objects again, I notice they are now spaced farther apart. I\u2019m all worked up now, and go sprinting to my friends house, I really didn\u2019t want to be the only one to see this.  My friend wasn\u2019t home right then so I grabbed his neighbor to come out.  Now there were three of these lights, flashing and pulsating an orangish reddish glow, all in a misshapen triangle form, with another one of the lights drifting up from the horizon to join the other three.  Then there was a smaller triangular formation that looked almost identical in formation just smaller, slowly drift up from the horizon.  At this point it was! me, my friends neighbor, and his wife and daughter. \tJust then  my friend pulled in his house, and my other friend who lives up the street came down, and then we had my 2 friends, and my friends mom and sister come look. At this point is when the objects started slowly dissipating. The lower, smaller triangle formation all dimmed slowly until they were gone, then what was left was the larger triangle formation. However now they were equidistant from each other, in a symmetrical  triangle until they all slowly dimmed out. What I thought was interesting, was the fact that atleast the one light, I\u2019ve observed for months, and the fact that last night I just watched this happen and now that light is gone, it\u2018s truly an awesome experience. A few details I forgot to put in, was that it was quite cloudy, and no stars we\u2019re visible, these were the only visible lights in the sky. And the movement of the objects was all very slow, they slowly came up and they slowly disappeared. Hoping that others have seen this, maybe even got video, I! know my friends mom and nieghbor got a few pictures  towards the end of it all, but a video would really be nice.

At first my coworkers and I thought that it could be gliders, but, not only because of the altitude, the objects changed direction, this seemed unlikely.  They moved very smoothly through the air.  They would stop briefly and continue moving.  We could see them only barely with the naked eye, but through polarized sunglasses they were unmistakeable, white chevron shaped objects.

My cell phone at the time didn't have any zooming capabilities.  The objects looked like balls of fire floating by.  They did not appear to be dropping in altitude like flares do.  They seemed to be orangeish/reddish/yellowish in nature....like fire. I even sent the pictures to a local TV station who put one of the pictures on the air in a short story reporting that a viewer (myself) saw some unexplained lights in the skies of West Seneca, NY. I showed the pictures to several people asking if anyone else had seen them.  Only one person told me that they saw something similar 2 hours earlier several miles away in the skies before dark.  My experience occurred during the dark night.  I remember pointing and asking a few strangers outside to look and asked what they could be.  They thought it was odd and didn't know.  I couldn't count the number of objects due to them moving as well as some appearing further away.  Trees also cut off the viewing capabilities. The objects all seemed to be moving at the same speed in the same direction.  They didn't appear to be dropping or rising in altitude.  They were moving slow enough for me to observe, but too fast to keep observing and taking pictures for more than a few minutes.",

There was conventional air traffic visible in the same general region of the sky at that time, and the difference between this light source and the planes was pretty obvious: those had regular blinking and distinct lights, even at a great distance, while this thing did not. It did not keep a perfectly straight course as near as I could tell--there appeared to be some \"wobbling,\" although not all of us agreed on that.  (At least one of us thought it was an illusion caused by the light flickering.)  My first thought was that it was a large flying paper lantern, but it was much too bright, much too high up, and after a minute it was clear that it was ascending too quickly for that. It was very clearly visible in the middle of a heavily light-polluted metropolitan area, so it wasn't a faint light. It appeared to be ascending very rapidly, much faster than I have ever personally seen a conventional aircraft rise.  Closest thing I could compare it to from my own experience is a space shuttle launch I saw about ten years ago, but this left no exhaust trail.

The flashes illuminated the sky/clouds in that direction.  I checked weather radar and did see a small thunderstorm cell in that area.   I know for a fact it was not a passenger jet or helicopter.   I found it incredibly unusual and immediately told my girlfriend about it.   We went back out and watched for a while but saw nothing else unusual.",

The area where they seemed to be is NE of the Buffalo airport, but we're used to seeing aircraft all the time, and this was really unusual.  It was too late for the setting sun to have illuminated anything.  The dots faded one at a time, while appearing to move slightly.  They weren't close enough to each other to be connected.

While waiting for my child's soccer practice to end, I was shooting with a new HD CAM to get practice for a forthcoming project.  I was shooting some leaves in a tree and other things in the park. When I returned home and viewed the footage on my computer, I saw an anomaly.  Did not think much of it at the time.  I got more experience with the edit suite and came across the footage again recently and decided to slow it down and zoom it in.  The anomaly seems to have shape of a diamond and possibly a light in the middle.  Would like to have it analyzed, though.

      "story": "Witnessed triangular shaped craft using clouds possibly as a cloaking device in the Ozarks. Early this morning I was on my way to work in Buffalo Missouri, a construction job, headed south from Springfield, MO.  The sun had already come up. I could see the horizon of Buffalo and noticed a very dark, odd looking, little rain cloud hovering low above the city, directly above the shortest of the cities three water towers and as high as the tallest.  The cloud was as wide as the town, which has a population of a little over 3,000 people.  It had been storming during the night but this strange cloud was the only one left.   Suddenly I watched as at least two (possibly a third on the far side) gigantic triangular shaped craft emerged from the north side (toward me) but pointing west.  The front one was about twice as big as the rear object. Both were the biggest aircraft i've ever seen, including a few stealth bombers.  They were black in color however the rear one never fully emerged and I never got a clear view of the bottom.  However I could tell that they we! re both pulsating a light from their centers.  The cloud seemed to cloak them both and the light strobed in the color of the very dark, almost black cloud, back to nothing, to dark cloud.  The light emitted looked like a tractor beam from a movie for a better visual reference.  The two crafts seemed to actually be one craft possibly as they were connected in the middle by what looked like piping.  Both seemed and covered in athe haze.  The cloud acted in the most unnatural way, wrapping around the craft as if it was pulling it back in, or the craft was pulling the cloud around it.   I honestly didn't believe what i was seeing and looked down.  When I looked up it was still there, so I pulled over to find my phone that was in the back to try to take a video.  When I finally found it the entire slow moving cloud, not just the craft,  was gone.  I only saw it for at most 45 seconds, the entire incident only lasting 2 minutes. And thats the end of it. I will be emailing an illustration a! nd a map within the next day or so.   Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke by telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  PD))",

Finally it appeared to move toward the north and east, and the glowing began to fade (became seemingly smaller) to what looked like a tiny dot, possibly orange or red.  eventually the light disappeared from my view.

I don't think it moved into cloud cover.  There was very little cloud cover if any last night.   I did not have a camera.  The reports of these lights is that they repeat on numerous nights in a row.",

There were several people (friends and family) outside at several stages of inhibriation remaining from the 4th of July fireworks that ended 1/2hr prior.  The sky was overcast with some bright stars and, I believe, the constellation Sagitarius visible directly above.  I'm not sure of exactly which one, whatever, but I then looked NW along the ridge line, we live along the Kanawha River Valley, and saw the UFO. It was a bright red and orange egg-shaped object, no more than 2-5mi away, in a stationary position and that is when I went for my iPhone 5s and started to record video after all were in agreement that it was what I was seeing.  In the video you will hear a female voice describe its movement, but it remained in a still position for a few minutes and then headed along the ridge line toward us.  As it came closer I was able to notice the lights in the middle and they were a greenish color, the lights were extremely bright so it was hard to be certain of the middle color, but from there it appeared as if the top and bottom were disjointed leaving me to believe that it was also \"wobbling\" as it was in motion. After the motion it once again stopped for a few moments and I got a straight on look at it once again. It was now in a steady position as if it were \"checkin us out,\" and from there it headed straight upwards.  Now to explain the \"vanishing\" is kind of hard to detail due to it being night and also being unaware of the specific cloud cover, but I can only give two theories as to what I saw from there.  Regardless of clouds the lights were so bright that it would have been hard for the clouds to hide so much of it so easily right away.   What I saw is it looked like it dissipated as if it went through a \"worm-hole\" kind of like Einstein explained in his Theory of Relativity and the 4th plane or dimension.   I'm not a UFO enthusiast and I'm not college educated, but I am a Navy veteran and was taught attention to detail, so that is the basis for the recollection\u2026",

We saw what appeared to look at a very bright star moving across the sky.  We kept watching it for a few minutes in and it beyond the clouds.  We then saw a few more less bright \"moving stars\" following behind.   I pointed them out to my friend because he didn't think the first one was a craft saying stars move.  I explained that they don't move like that.  '' About a minute later, we saw another six crafts in a different formation.  I commented that they are really moving under the cover of the clouds in our area.  When I scanned the sky again I saw two crafts in front of the original very bright craft that initially caught my attention.  I have seen many crafts moving in the sky, but never this many - this close together.  My friend said they were likely planes.  I explained planes do not fly that high.  Possible that they could be drones operated remotely, but I do not think this many in these particular formations or! at these speeds.  Possible that it could be satellites but again not in these formations moving at these speeds or this many at one time.  The crafts were moving from North Easterly to South Westerly direction.  I never have reported sightings in the past and wasn't going to report this one.  A quick search online showed a few articles indicating that a \"cargo fleet\" was moving through our inner solar system.   I was very fortunate to view this from Buffalo, N.Y. 14240, USA under a partly cloudy sky with a dark backdrop beyond the sky.  I just wish I had 1 - a scope & 2 - another enthusiast to witness this event!   Note:  The shapes of the crafts were not identifiable from the distance and I was viewing with my naked eye.

All of a sudden an extremely large bright elongated teardrop shape fluorescent  to dark jade green light flew across the sky horizontally.  It was moving so fast, it was a matter of seconds and I couldn't see it anymore as it made its way from the western sky to the eastern sky.  It seemed like it was flying low. It was far below the stars or the path of a plane.  There was a very bright white flash of light behind it.  There wasn't any noise.  No other visible objects or colors were seen.",

      "story": "Everyone saw this thing, including The Buffalo Police I remember this like it was yesterday. My parents had taken us for ice cream followed by a trip to the waterfront to get a breeze off the lake.  It was something we did quite a bit in the summer because of the hot humid Buffalo summers and we didn't have AC then . Well, as we were driving in Our station wagon , all 8 of us . While on Tifft St. headed towards the lake, my mother and father pointed out something strange in the sky.  It was shape like a cigar and had multiple colors revolving on it.  It was silent and slowly moving in an odd diagnol manner, side to side, up and down . Thing was very bright and hovered as well from time to time.  It scared to hell out of everyone in the car.  I remember how loud and frantic us kids got. It was there for what it felt like was forever.  People were pulled over and out of their cars watching.  There were Buffalo Policemen doing the same.  People came out of local businesses and their homes to watch this thing.  It was a mass sighting!  Then in an instant it went left then it went right on an upward angle a it was gone in an instant.  People in the neighborhood talked about this for years.  Nothing ever came about it.  It was just one of those things that happened in our neighbor hood.   My brother and I talk about it occasionally and we were discussing it at work one day and another guy overheard us and he said remembers seeing it too.  This was at least 20 + yrs later.  We consider ourselves extremely lucky for witnessing this UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "I didn't see any light in the sky while taking the photos, the light anomaly was visible after the photo was taken. I took a series of photos from my bedroom window down buffalo, NY, because the sky was beautiful.  4 photos were taken one after the other with my android phone at 9:13 pm, June 19th, 2018. On June 29, I looked for the photos I'd taken as reference for a painting using the colors of the sky, that's when I saw the unusual light anomaly in the sky.  There was no light behind me, I did not notice anything in the sky when I took the photo. ((NUFORC Note:  One photo shows an image of a small source of light, backed by an evening sky.  We do not know what the light is, but do not have enough information, we believe, to be able to conclude that it is an authentic alien spacecraft.  PD))",

Once noticing no FAA flashing lights, we continued to observe the glowing sphere go out of view behind a building.  We waited approx. 30 sec for the object to be viewable again, it was now either further away or far less bright.  It was observable for an additional 20 or so seconds, flickered and then disappeared.

At that point i decided to take a picture, during the time i was getting my phone ready to take a picture, the UFO had done a 180 degree loop and cut across it's vertical vapor trail and continued in an eastward direction...  Afterwards when I looked at the photo you could very clearly see the object as a glowing Green orb.",
