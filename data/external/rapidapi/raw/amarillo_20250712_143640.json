When my grandfather picked me up from Puckett Elementry School at 15:00 we went down Bell St. I noticed something silver and shiny, at the corner of my eye. I looked out the passenger side window and saw something rectangular about three feet away from me. I said \" Papa look \" and he said \"what?\" and then I felt it, it looked solid but felt like jello. I heard my voice singing a song that I had stuck in my head from quior that morning. Then I saw three lines that had looked a lot like the design on my shoes. My grandfather couldn't see it from where he was sitting (driving). I saw a square on top that was blueish and translucent. This is where I saw the lines that resembles on my shoe. Then it vanished very quickly from my sight.",

East of town near airport and Bell Helicoptor approx. 10-11pm. Myself and 2 others driving over bridge which gave us the chance of spotting them. One bright bright white light and a secong elevated slightly higher but not as bright. After approx. 5-6 min. of sitting still the smaller light darts directly toward the brighter larger light. Larger light grows slightly brighter and darts away into the sky while second light stays. Second light stays in position until we can no longer see the lights. Later on at approx. 3-4 am we are driving back into town, of course I'm all freaked so my eyes are on the sky. Me and driver (3rd person now at home) spot a dim blue glowing object moving slowly against the wind through the clouds.  After approx. 10 sec. it brightens slightly and we distinctly see the object dart through the clouds and into the sky. Seems as if these sightings occur only in those locations at certain times late at night. In my opinion it is impossible that they were planes due to their movement, appearance and behavior. Objects spotted near airport, Bell Helicoptor and Pantex so maybe they're OURS. Thank you for allowing me to report this sighting.

      "story": "Overflight of three white luminescent delta shaped craft in a triangular formation. The city of Amarillo sits at about 3700' above sea level and if you are in an area where street lighting or other ambient lighting is somewhat blocked, the sky can be fairly dark for a metropolitan area. Such was the location of my sighting; an east-west driveway that is bounded by a seven foot wood gate on the east, my house (roof height of 25' to 40' at its peak) along the south side, my neighbors 6' fence, house and 50' tree on the north side boundary, and the west side bounded by a stand of 30 -45' trees. My house sits in the east to west take-off flight path of our airport which is approx. 10 miles due east. Those planes are normally transiting a bit north of, yet parallel with this driveway. As an avid aviation buff since I was very young (my grandfather had a horse farm right across the highway from the now closed Amarillo Air Base which was a SAC installation), I am always checking the sky. On this particular night at 12:35 AM, I had taken my dogs out one last time for the night and I was standing in the driveway area that is darker than any other area around the north or west side of my house, perusing the sky. For whatever reason, I was looking straight to the east when I noticed three pinpoints of light emerging from the tree line of my neighbors house across the street (this would have been at an angle of about 20 degrees). These three points of light increased in size to the point where I could see that they were each delta shaped and were in a tight triangular formation as well. I was stunned that they were perfectly aligned with my driveway! At about 75 degrees I could see that the back edge of each delta shaped light was blurred. When these objects were directly overhead I would say that they were each about 1 1/2 width of a quarter. The formation remained tight until about 120 degrees (the objects were close to entering the west tree line boundary which would obscure my clear view) when the lights suddenly performed a \"shuffling\" move and regrouped into the same triangular formation. During the entire episode, I would say that each light's luminosity remained constant, only the relative size of the object/light increased and diminished as would be expected. Absolutely no noise whatsoever. One final kicker - as I was trying to figure the speed/altitude of the overflight and looking straight up from the same position - I saw a meteor streak from southeast to northwest and flame out right over my head! (obviou sly at a very high altitude because the streak was the length of my forearm and unobstructed by the roof line). Because of the manner in which the lights first appeared I was thinking that they could be at a fairly low altitude (5000 - 10,000'?), but at the overhead apex I just could not get a \"read\". But I do estimate their speed to be at least 3-5 times faster than an aircraft if they were both at a relative cruising altitude. But I do have to emphasize the point that while this sighting was very exciting, the orientation of their east to west flight path right down the center axis of my driveway was astonishing!",

It wasn't high enough to be a satellite, and to the best of my knowledge, all airplanes have blinking lights.  This object was not blinking.  It disappeared, possibly into some high clouds, though clouds were scarce that evening because we could see the stars quite clearly.  About a minute or two passed.  We were joking around and speculating the distance the object might have traveled over the time that had elapsed when suddenly a VERY bright light slowly blinked high in the sky- at the exact spot our rough calculations had placed the flying object.  It looked like a headlight that had turned on- then off.  It flashed once more and it was over.  Kind of like when kids are playing Morse Code with flashlights.  It was an alarming spectacle because the light was incredibly large for any object at that high of a distance-- and it was much, much larger than any light source that might come from an airplane.",

      "story": "Craft shaped like a cube of bright swirling light, hovering over downtown Amarillo at 3:00 a.m., spot lights and heavenly music . . . After retiring to bed on a late Sunday evening in a cheap downtown motel room in Amarillo, watching television until I fall asleep, I tossed and turned until somewhere between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m., when suddenly a light flickered through the curtains.  I didn\u2019t pay much attention as I thought it to be a neon sign on the Bank of America building across the street.  I rolled over and attempted to sleep when the light again flickered through the curtains.  I still ignored it, and again with even more intensity the light flickered through the curtains. I reluctantly got up and moved the curtains so I could see where the light was coming from.  I looked up at the top of the Bank of America building of about 20 stories high and the neon sign was not flickering.  I was closing the curtains when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter surrounded by bright lights. Spot lights were coming from the base and shining in various spots in the parking lot.  My first thought was that it was some kind of drug bust and the helicopter would be landing with a swat team.  However, the craft did not land, but stayed hovering high in the dark night.  Now it had definitely got my attention. As I focused on it, I made out the shape to be a cube, definitely three dimensional.  I couldn\u2019t make out any substance such as steel.  It was a cube of light, swirling bright light on a three dimensional cube.  I was still trying to rationalize what it could be.  I then remembered seeing special shape hot air balloons in Albuquerque which lit up at night in similar fashion.  \"That\u2019s what is must be,\" I told myself.  Then something even stranger happened.  I heard musical tones similar to wind chimes or ancient flutes that we often hear in Greek mythology type movies.  But the sounds were coming from inside my head even though it felt I was hearing them with my ears. I became afraid and did not move for about 20 minutes while I continued to watch.  I finally said to myself, \"What ever it is knows I am here, and I cannot hide from it.\"   I immediately dressed and walked outside.  I stayed underneath the 2nd floor overhang and peered out to see above.  It was even more magnificent when viewing through the night air although it was hard to focus on, somewhat blurred.  At that moment I was surrounded by an orchestra of musical tones again sounding like ancient flutes or pipes.  I thought to myself, how beautiful!  The song was child like, something you might hear a children\u2019s nursery.  Again, I heard the music in my head and outside, but not in our natural way of hearing, hard to explain . . . To make a long story short, I packed my bags and was running to my SUV when an early morning garbage truck and driver stopped in the alley next to my car. I looked at the driver in the eyes and signaled to look up with my eyes.  I turned and ran with luggage in tow, got in my car and drove two hours to my home in Lubbock.  I drove to my sister\u2019s office where my mother happened to be and told both of them what I witnessed.  By the look on their faces they were fearful for me.  I phoned a friend of mine who happens to be a deputy sheriff in Amarillo to ask if anyone had phoned in such a sighting in the early morning dark.  He laughed hysterically and said no, but would let me know if anyone did.  He did not call back.  I\u2019ve since moved to Phoenix and have told only a handful of people what I witnessed that early morning on June 20, 2005, five years ago.

It seemed to be traveling in a north and then northwest direction. The second possible ufo, I got on video, but it was farther away and it looks like just a light on the recording.  I was traveling south on a straight road and you can tell it is not moving from side to side.  It was not getting fainter or brighter, so it must not have been moving towards me or away from me.  This leads me to believe that it was hovering. Something else I saw that could be \"something\" is hovering to the southeast of my house.  On the video I got of it, it brightens and darkens itself.  It seems to be stationery.  I must admit, I could just be excited about my previous sightings and it could be a planet or bright star that I have not previously noticed.

My friend and I were engaged in light conversation when he suddenly asked \"What kind of plane is that?\". I looked through the front windshield of the vehicle and observed an object overhead with an orange light being emitted but could not identify it immediately.  The object was triangular with rounded edges and appeared to be traveling in a rough south-east to north-west direction moving over S.Bell St. toward I-27 and the Arden Rd.area. I rolled down the window and stuck my head out of the vehicle to get a better look at it and I observed the object to be flying low just over the power lines and moving rather leisurely and I at this point realized that the craft did not have wings or rotors or landing struts.  The object appeared to slow just long enough for me to study its underside and I observed tha! t the skin of the craft appeared beige in color and textured and the craft itself was about the size of a full moon if not slightly larger.  There was an individual non-blinking orange light illuminating the craft and the craft made no sound.  I noticed that the craft appeared to warble slightly as it followed its trajectory. I requested to my friend that we should follow it and he immediately turned right onto Ventura Dr and stopped. We both observed the back of the craft which was illuminated orange and observed it to move over I-27 and then slowly bank to the left behind a billboard and downward toward Arden Rd.  We lost sight of it at that point and continued on to our destination.  After we started our return home we briefly drove to where we thought the craft was trying to land and found nothing.  We placed a call, upon arriving back home to the local private airport, Tradewinds Airport, and inquired about light aircraft being in the area.

They stated ! however that occasionally the Randall County Sheriffs Dept flies their helicopter with unusual lights equipped. The location of the sighting is on the southern edge of the city of Amarillo and there were street lights illuminating the road and a moderate amount of traffic on I-27 for that time in the evening.",

As they got closer a small green light was rotating around them, as they got closer the green light was brighter and spinning fast enough to leave a circle trace around the red light. I thought they were propellers spinning.  They were 50 - 100 feet up heading west. When they were almost over us I recognized a smoky haze inside of the circles they remained next to each other and could have been part of the same object.  I would approximate them at 10 - 20 feet in diameter green part and 1 foot or less diameter for the red portion in the middle. My sister saw blinking square red lights inside the red circles. It passed right over us and we could not track it because we were traveling 75 miles an h! our the opposite direction. It appeared to travel slow over us, but I could not gage because of the darkness.",

I was about 10 to 11 miles out from city center when I saw ahead and slightly to the right over some radio towers about a mile high was this white glowing football shape.  More like an eye since the ends were sharp.   It just sat there over the towers for about 2 minutes and suddenly began moving left and right about 6 miles at a time in a fraction of a second.  It would get so fast that it would disappear and reappear in different spots.   Next it began doing that same maneuver but this time would move to and from over the freeway, over me.   Now I was having a hard time following it with my head out the window, and had giant rolls of aluminum on the flatbed I didn't want to run off the road with, so I stopped looking. The craft was no doubt as large if not larger than a football field.  I don't know what the date was I'm just guessing.  It's been a while.  Sky was clear, maybe 1 skinny cloud way off.",

It looked very small considering how far into the sky it seemed to be.  It had a white circle in the middle of the bigger green coloring.   It took about three seconds for the craft to shoot all the way from the left, to the right side of the sky right in front of me.  It was far, far too fast to be anything built by modern humans.

Just before sundown I saw something moving on the western horizon and jumped up to get a better look.  When the objects were about half way from the western horizon to my position I could see that they were disk shaped craft.  I was at the state fair and they flew silently almost directly over my position. Their altitude was quite low so at arms length they were about the size of a soda can bottom. I could see four round, port-hole windows on the bottom of each craft.  There was green light shining through each window like it was just the interior light and not a beam or external light.  The bodies of the craft were grayish, metal looking. Flying from horizon to horizon only took about eight to ten seconds and going that fast they were not stream-lined like one would expect but wobbled slightly from side to side like there was some sort of magnetic attraction-repulsion as they flew.  They were completely silent. There was a person walking close by when the craft were just overhead and I told him there were \"UFOs there\" and pointed up, but he purposely looked down, not wanting to be fooled.  Once the craft were out of sight, he looked up and not seeing anything he gave me a disapproving grunt like he knew there wasn't going to be anything!
