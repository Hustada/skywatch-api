      "story": "Three high flying, slow moving objects holding formation during the daytime on a clear blue Sunday afternoon. My son and I had just gone for a bike ride around Greenlake in North Seattle because it was a very nice, clear afternoon. When we returned home a little before 6:00 PM, we were laying in the grass in the front yard looking up at the blue sky and noticed an faint object very high in the sky that was moving north to south at a slow speed.  It had the appearance of a white point of light, like a satellite, but it was during the daytime.  It appeared to be too high to be a commercial aircraft and it was moving too slow.  I thought it might be a satellite also because it appeared to almost drift at times, but then I noted it would make sudden bursting movements. After a few minutes, my son noticed another object and it appeared the two objects were approaching each other.  At that time, I called my wife and daughter outside and they could see the two objects as well.  Eventually, the two objects came so close together they seemed to briefly merge.  The two objects then separated and that\u2019s when we saw the third object, but not before I saw a streak of light that resembled a faint meteor, streak near the objects. The three objects then held a tight triangular formation for a few minutes until their luminosity faded to the point where we couldn\u2019t see them anymore.  Afterwards, we all discussed what we saw and we all agreed we saw the same thing.  This sighting was during broad daylight but one would have had to be looking straight up at the sky to see it, and even then you would have had to be focusing fairly intently to see and track the objects. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport - The objects were too far/faint to show up with the cell phone camera.  We tried with multiple devices but they just were not seen with the camera.  I would provide the information I provided you to the local media if they were interested.  But without video or pictures, I am not sure they would be interested.

      "story": "Saw triangle craft, news report says space junk, not from my angle. My wife and I were driving north on 15th Ave Ne near Northgate Mall when she called my attention to a triangle pattern of three white lights, one at each corner, not far above us, maybe 200 yards in a diagonal line of sight. It was clear the lights were part of one solid object although it was too far to make out any details of the craft. I had been living in the Seattle area for all of my 28+ years at the time including living next to the Renton airport for several years. I have seen many types of aircraft from commercial to fighter planes and this looked nothing like anything I had seen before. The sunroof  was open when she let out what I would guess is the usual reaction: \u201cwhat the!\u201d. I am one who looks for a logical explanation when confronted with something I can\u2019t immediately explain and figured at first glance it was a stealth fighter. I had seen one at about the same distance but I immediately realized that there was no sound. Stealth technology may make these planes almost invisible on radar but when I saw one it was far from silent. Also, there were only the three white lights. No red and blue warning lights that you see on a typical airplane. We both had a very eerie feeling as we couldn\u2019t make sense of it. When we got home that night we saw on the news that \u201cstrange lights\u201d were seen in the Seattle area that night and were dismissed as space debris from a falling satellite that crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Ok, a plausible explanation except we were heading north and the object was heading from west to east at that point, and that\u2019s a really long way to get to the Pacific.  I can\u2019t imagine space debris is capable of changing direction. I have since seen footage of an old Russian satellite that fell out of orbit a few years back and was filmed by a fishing boat crew as it came down and burned up in the atmosphere. It looked nothing like what we saw. Three lights in a triangular pattern that appeared to be one object, flying low and slow with no running noise. I am one who p! refers t o go from A to B instead of A to Alien but what we saw was very similar to video footage I have seen on tv of  triangle shaped objects with three or more lights on the bottom.. The lights were evenly spaced and were moving very slowly, but being one who prefers a rational explanation,I probably would have accepted the news explanation and forgotten about it. The fact they said it landed in the Pacific when what we saw it CLEARLY heading east has always bothered me, that and I am 99.9% sure what I saw was not space debris. I have searched a couple of databases (yours and MUFON) but haven\u2019t seen anything else that sounds like what we saw. Enough people saw it that it was mentioned on the news but I cant find any other reports. I am not sure what year it was, only that it was between 1995 and 1998.

As the object came closer, never asending nor decending and keeping its pace of what would be considered a casual stroll, the appearance became more detailed. It was about 50 feet overhead, traveling above the the telephone lines that run paralel with my street when I had a better view. It made no sound, infact I experienced silence, not even any sounds of the chirps and bird songs usually heard in my neighborhood on normal occasions. The object was rectangular with rounded edges. It seemed like various cubes stacked on one another with rounded edges forming a long rectangle. The size seemed to be aprox. 10-12 ft. tall x 5-6 ft. wide. Its exterior was clear opaque with a tinge of color like natural sinew. Inside the object a liquid looking substance that was blood red in color seemed to be circulating within, but only circulating within the object through its center keeping aprox. 2 ft. parameter within. The texture appeared to be like a latex form. The bottom of the object formed 4 bulbous cubes where the red substance seemed to be in four different sections. I stood in amazement and watched it travel in the southern direction. Overall, the time duration from when I first noticed the object till it traveled into the horizon was about 1/2 an hour. As the object traveled into the horizon it  appeared to have an aura. I've seen many unusual objects in my life but this was by far the most unusual thing I've ever witnessed, it was beautiful!

On this particular date, Tuesday, March 08, 1994, I decided to drop by the Last Exit on Brooklyn coffee house, where I was a frequent denizen and patron. When I entered the establishment, a male patron there, whom I knew well by that time, hailed me over to his table, stating that he wanted to tell me something unusual.  He was surprisingly animated, and seemed quite excited by what it was that had just happened to him and his girlfriend. The two of them proceeded to describe how they had been walking north on the east side of University Avenue, and just south of NE 50th, when they witnessed an intensely bright fireball streaking across the night sky, at approximately 7:15 (??) p.m. (Pacific).  They witnessed the object, which was as bright as a welder's torch, streak across the clear night sky, make several abrupt, almost instantaneous, turns, and then streak to the east, or southeast, disappearing from their view behind a building. A moment later, they witnessed a second, identical, object performe a similar maneuver across the sky, and apparently follow approximately the flight path of the first object. I am certain of the date of the event, but I am uncertain as to the exact time of the sighting. The male witness to this event was interviewed by an ABC news camera team in January 2005, and he appears in the ABC special, entitled \"UFO's:  Seeing is Believing.\"  I consider the witness to be highly credible, and the incident was reported to me perhaps within minutes of its occurrence. Neither of the two witnesses was aware of the dramatic sighting that occurred that same night over Lake Michigan, and perhaps at approximately the same time as the sighting over the University District in Seattle. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Peter Davenport, Director, National UFO Reporting Center, on behalf of the witnesses.  Also, this event occurred at the same time that a Michigan State Patrol Officer was witnessing a cluster of unidentified objects over Lake Michigan, as they were also being observed on weather radar by a radar operator at a U. S. National Weather Service station.  PD))",

So then I look over counting a total of five of them The first one closest to me must have been at a lover altitude ore it was bigger in sice I dont know. The other four were visible at the same altitude ore size, they were sitting there in a formation stright line with the two last ones forming a arrow tail. The exact location was between seatac and Sattle downtown I'd say right over Beakon hill. Its to difficuld to guess the altitude my guess 5000feet Agl or less then 10000 AGl. At one point they drifted furder north closer to Seattle at a very slow speed perhaps 3 Miles in distance,against the wind ,later they drifted about 4 Miles South East and stayed put once more all this in a spane of aproximatley 30 minutes. I brought this up becouse I whatched your show on cabel obout UFO sighting in Arizona in 1997 .What I saw took place during the bright daylight hours and perhaps not so clear ore easy to spot for meany other peaople . They were not lid up like in Arizona at night.

I believe it was from 1000-2000 feet away from me, moving slow enough for me to watch it for 15-20 seconds.  It had three circular lights underneath it with smaller lights around the 3 big ones.  The lights where a dim yellow / white hue, they weren't shining down, they were just merely on.  There was nothing at all blocking my view from it, but after 15-20 seconds it simply vanished.  It didn't vanish into the horizon, or disappear behind a cloud, nor did it do any cool star wars tricks, it just faded away in front of my eyes.   I should also note that there was no cars on the road near me, no airplanes or helicopters above me and this thing made ZERO sound whatsoever.  It should have been loud as hell the distance it was from me, so it was very confusing to my senses.  I stood outside for another 20 minutes trying to see if it would come again, and in that course of time I saw 2 shooting stars and a satellite way above earth, so I am 100% positive it was neither of those things.  I have always semi-believed in alien life forms, but maybe it's the kind of thing you will never fully believe until you see it with your own eyes.  I know what I saw.  The moment I saw it I knew I was looking at a UFO.",

      "story": "Fast moving lights over Seattle \tLast Friday, April 25, 2008, at or around 9:00 pm I was in the back yard glassing the sky with a Gen 3 NVD.  While out, I saw planes, birds and many satellites, some that could be seen with the naked eye as well as some that could not.  All of a sudden while facing south, positioned around 10:30-11:00 in the sky, and to my left, I witnessed two objects traveling north.  The field of view for this device is 40 degrees and the device has no magnification.  The objects appeared to be about the same brightness as a satellite when seen through the device, yet could not be viewed at all without it.  The objects were approximately 1/8 inch apart when viewed through the lens.  They were traveling in a Delta, lead/wingman profile, and moved both fast and in a deliberate manner.  At about 12 O-clock in the sky, the object in the rear and right of the front object took an abrupt turn, heading 90 degrees to the right, disappearing over the building to my left.  This entire event took place in about 5-7 seconds.  Later, timing of satellites traveling in approximately the same direction took a voice count of about 60-80 one thousands to travel the same distance. \tAfter this sighting, I went inside to tell my girlfriend about it.  She thought I was kidding her.  I went back outside and within 15 minutes I saw what appeared to be the same objects traveling south, in the same fast, deliberate manner, again, oriented in the same manner to one another and again bright as a satellite through the lens, but not visible to the naked eye.  I went inside again and this time was able to convince my girlfriend to come have a look.  I believe we were outside less than 15 minutes when she saw the same objects and within a matter of what felt like minutes saw them again.  After she went inside, I witnessed them one more time, again traveling north to south, same configuration, same speed.  I am not sure whether said objects were emitting light or reflecting light; my feeling is that they were reflecting light.  I would approximate the whole chain of events to have happened in at the utmost 1 to 1 1/2 hours time.",

I went out on my deck to check the sky again once more before going to bed and my attention was drawn to the North as commercial flights were taking off to the North tonight and circling around Seattle, anyway, there was a bright red light moving in a northerly direction and ascending at a fairly slow speed.  I did a double take because I could not believe my eyes,  I thought at first a plane or helicopter but it was just a red light, no blinkers or different colors, just a steady glowing, red orb.  A commercial jet actually passed in front of it (from my view) and was banking left to head Westerly, this is when I knew it was NOT a plane or helicopter!  I knocked on the French door for my wife and frantically waved at her to come outside.  She came out and witnessed it for a minute and then went back in,   So, I ran and got my binocs and went to the front yard where I got an unobstructed view. By this time it was higher and I\u2019m going to guess about 3-4 thousand feet?  Maybe less, I see plenty of Cessna\u2019s flying at about the same altitude.  It then stopped and stayed in the relative same place for several minutes, it would sort of pulse I guess I would say or become less intense of a red every couple seconds.  It finally dimmed and then was gone.  I estimate that where it hovered for the longest would\u2019ve been maybe a couple miles or so north of me, putting it directly over the West Seattle Freeway or the Seattle Port maybe?  It was very strange indeed specially due to the fact that I sent in a report last night for a triangle craft or 3 lights in formation that sped across the sky!  Strange times.",

The sky was cloud free...in consideraton of seeing other aircraft in the sky, I would say it was approxmiately 2000 feet in the air.  At first I thought it was a large helium, party balloon.  After looking at it more closely, I realised it was a round, solid object.  It traveled fairly fast...I would say it was traveling faster than a jet approaching SEATAC. (We live one block from Aurora Avenue (Hwy.99) between a major avenue and a cemetery.)  At the same time I was telling my friend on the phone what I was seeing.  She too was fascinated by what I was telling her and I gave her a \"play-by-play\" account while I was looking at the object. I watched it until I could no longer see it in the distance.  I felt frightened and fascinated at the same time.  Also, it had a fuzzy glow about it and no sound seemed to be coming from it.

However it appeared to not be moving, and all of sudden it shot off to the west, then back east. It was moving side to side, and up & down, at a slow pace. Then it would move in circles and zig-zags, continuing these patterns for hours. My brothers came inside to get me out of bed and pointed it out to me, I saw it doing everything they had claimed it was doing. Through taking a look at different angles and using different reference points we were able to establish that it was between 50 and 100 miles away, likely over North Bend, Washington. The unidentified light was out before they went outside, at approx. 11pm, and remained out until we all went to bed, after 1am, but it continued moving around and would be in different spots ranging from directly south to directly southeast, constantly moving, then stopping, and changing the pattern of it\u2019s flight.

I am a male, and was 37 years of age at the time of this sighting. I work in the printing industry and have a background in fine art. I feel these two facts enhance my testimony and illustration provided.  I noticed two stationary extremely bright white lights, side-by-side horizontally in a fixed position at about 400 feet above the ground, in the sky directly in front of me. At first it appeared to be an aircraft coming in for a landing, the bright lights being standard landing lights.  After several seconds I noticed two odd things about these lights. Firstly, they were a bit too far apart for an ordinary plane configuration and secondly, they were barely moving  closer to me despite my driving towards them. This clearly indicated to me that the object was in fact stationary and not moving forward as an airplane would do.  I slowed my car down considerably since nobody was driving behind me, and started carefully observing the craft.  The two lights remained in their fixed positions for a moment and then began banking slowly and steadily to the left, all the while not getting any closer to me. After tilting to about 45 degrees the lights began approaching me smoothly and steadily.  As the lights came nearer, the object started to pass me to my left at  an altitude of roughly 40 feet, and travelling approximately 20-30 miles per hour. It looked to be about 30 feet in length, and 10 feet in width. It remained tilted at a 45 degree angle the remaining duration of the sighting. The two extremely bright lights had now dimmed, or perhaps were no longer pointed directly at me and only seemed dimmer because of this.  As it drifted past to my left, I got a very good look at it since I had slowed my car down considerably to about 25 miles per hour. At the closest point it was only about 50 feet from my car. The object was sillouetting the lights of the valley and the distant hills and dark gray sky behind it, revealing a distinct long cylindrical shape. There were roughly six white lights on the visible side of the object, with no particular order to their distribution and they were all rather small. The lights were in two slightly differing sizes, with the upper and lowest lights being the larger. There weren't any strobes on this object, or any small colored marker lights which to my knowledge is not the case with conventional aircraft. There were no rotors, wings, cockpit or audible sound. A helicopter would definately have some audible noise at such a close distance, and the rotors would have been visible. There was one large red light on the side and just about dead center, which blinked with a slow on-and-off pattern at one second length intervals. This red light appeared at least a foot in diameter and didn't flash, but steadily faded off and on. This red light was a perfect circle which appeared raised like a dome similar to a lighting fixture one might have on the ceiling of their home. There was a very narrow and bright beam of light emanating from the center of the object and aimed directly in front of it. The beam of light was aimed just slightly lower than horizontally. The searchlight was steady and appeared fixed to the object because it never changed position in any way.  The object continued off toward my left rear and floated over the ground at the same altitude, it's searchlight still shining out and onto the ground below and continued at a south-easterly direction.  Since this time I have observed multiple helicopters at night in order to make a comparison and there are no similarities between any helicopters and this UFO.

The disk moved exactly like a wheel being pushed across the ground because as the disk rotated at the same speed as the object moved forward. It also maintained a constant height above the ground, moving up as it approached and cleared a hill and then down as it went down the other side of the hill.  The speed of the object was 5 or 6 MPH. The size was at least 60 feet across (from one edge of the disk to the other). The altitude was at least 60 feet. It easily cleared a group of 40-50 foot tall trees.

Around 9pm, I saw a very odd shaped black object hovering in the sky.  I grabbed my binoculars and saw a black, liberty-bell shaped object with no wings, no lights, no props...no apparent means of propulsion.  It was about the height that a traffic helicopter flies, and about the same size, maybe smaller. I walked outside and walked due North on Melrose Ave. just parallel to I-5.  The object was now North of downtown Seattle, over the University District.  I took a photo of it, but it was just a speck at this distance.  There was a couple on the street looking at it too, they were perplexed and fascinated. Eventually it just drifted away.  During the entire sighting, this object floated silently, and slowly, in plain view of all Seattle.",

There was an odd buzzing noize and a strange light pattern on the cieling above us. I heard scuffling sounds in the kitchen behind my head and became intensely afraid. Just as I was about to investigate three distinct figures with huge heads and small bodies \"glided\" into the room. The room was dark but I could plainly see that they were not human! There is light from the street that comes in enough to where i can make out a face. These things were wearing dark coveralls that ere tight and showed off skinny bodies. They also wore msaks of some kind and all i could see as far as thier faces went was thier huge black eyes surrounded by patches of light skin in the eye slits of the masks. Thier beltlines were about level with the bed so i guees they are about 4' tall. I was NOT asleep or dreaming! I was immediately terrified out of my mind and tried to scream but could not even move. It was as if a nightmare was coming true. Supe-sureal as the people who witnessed 9-11 must have felt as the planes hit or towers came down. One stood at the foot of the bed and the other two were on my side. Mywife stayed asleep. they were making strange noises as if breathing through ventilators. Ialso heard mechanical sounds. Almost immediately I was lifted into the air afoot or two as if by magic. I could still feel the skin of my wife's shoulder under my hand and the blanket on top of us as well as open space and cool air below. I sensed movement all around and the room seemed to wobble and spatially distort. I tried to kick at them but could notmove so I tried to lean from side to side in the air. I calledout mentally for God and the Lord Jesus Christ to save me and instantly I was back on the bed and the beings and strange glow was gone. The Lord saved me from those things. It was not as if I was set down or just woke up. It was as if one moment I was up in the air and the next moment I was down. I didn't even blink! They were gone! I know that this was no dreamas it seemed real and the memory hasn't faded one bit as dreams do. i woke up my wife in a panic but did notwant to scare her so I let her fall beck asleep without telling her until the next day. Besides Iknew that Jesus would not let them return. I remember that at least 20 minutes had passed but do not remember the time it was over exactly. I only remember less than a few minutes of it. Praise God!!! This is not the first time.",

I was, and still try to be a skeptic.  I study science and specialize in mental health.  However, while driving along Interstate-5 near Seattle, I saw something I could not explain very well but will do my best now.  It was a craft in the sky that appeared on a side view at first, as a black slit, not moving, then panned towards me revealing its disk shape and the top of the craft.  From this view it was shiny and light in color, but opaque like glow-in- the-dark material that is not glowing.  It then veered to the left and flew back up vertically, seeming to be sucked into the clouds.   After this, a small monoplane flew by in the area traveling east. Then a commercial jet flew nearby traveling northwest.  This gave me scale and relative perspective to the craft.  When the craft disappeared, it was as if it was fleeing from sight of the two planes that would soon come into view.  I then looked to the car next to me and noticed a man in a BMW also looking up at the area in the sky talking on a cell phone.  It appeared that other drivers were looking up as well.

I have felt that we are not alone on this planet my entire life. However, I never had an experience like the one I\u2019m about to share with the National UFO reporting center.  Last night at around 11:50pm my partner and I were looking out of our window, which faces west when we saw something in the sky. It seemed pretty close to the horizon, but also seemed pretty far away. I can\u2019t say how far the object was. The object in question was a spherical light, which started off a bit dull and muted, and quickly brightened. At its brightest it looked as though it were spinning, or had spinning lights.  It then turned an orange-red color and disappeared. A few minutes later it reappeared in a different spot. It started off dull and then brightened just like the first time. Then turned red and disappeared again. Over the next half hour it disappeared and reappeared six different times. Each time it seemed to be moving west to northwest.  The sphere and light was mostly white, and only changed to red prior to disappearing. Although at one point as we watched it spin, I saw some blue-green color. We stopped watching at 12:18am and went to bed. I don\u2019t know what we saw, but it was an unidentified flying object. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a sighting of Venus would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witnesses observed anything unusual.  D))",

After my lessons one of my friends came by to say hi and he is a graduate from the University of Washington who is a skeptic in the UFO area but this was an eye opener so we walk up to my car and the obeject was still in the area but at a very high altitude around 15,000 to 18,000 in front of clouds that were out on this day.

About 10-15 minutes later, after she had arrived, I was looking outside in my backyard and saw the exact same type of objects she saw.  There were several of these high altitude objects in the sky over the next 20 minutes or so. Some looked like jets, but a few did not. I'm no expert here, so for all I know these could be extremely high jets or it could just be a NORAD exercise or something, but someone said I should post it here so I did.

      "story": "Large circular object quickly streaked across sky heading north, lasted couple seconds then lost sight. Last night, shortly after midnight I witnessed what I can only describe as a UFO. The area I live is in the very northwest corner of Seattle. In the immediate vicinity there are many lights at play fields, schools, and all along the Highway 99 and I-5 corridors. The light pollution is intense, plus add to that the very bright street lights along most of the streets allow for very few stars to be seen, even on the clearest nights. It was mostly clear last night, with some light cloud cover.  It was windy and fairly chaotic with much traffic noise. At approximately 12:15 AM an object traveling northbound in the sky caught my attention very quickly. There was no noise emitted that I could hear over the wind and traffic, but it seemed close enough that it should have given some report. Initially, I was not paying attention, but caught the movement in my peripheral. I generally pay attention to air traffic, which usually goes from the north to south (Sea-Tac), or east/north east to the south west (Renton?). This object was heading what appeared to be directly north, which usually only occurs when a Coast Guard helicopter is flying along the I-5 corridor.  My first thought was it must be a shooting star.. an enormous shooting star. But the light intensity stayed exactly the same and the path it traveled appeared perfectly straight never varying or arching in the slightest. The reason I thought it was a meteor was because the velocity - it traveled very fast. My view of the east sky is limited on the south and north by large trees and houses. The clear area in which the object was visible runs a good length between the trees, I guess maybe twenty to thirty degrees of unbroken sky. It traveled almost the entire length - from when I took notice and raised my head - to the tree on the north end in a couple seconds. I attempted to follow the path beyond the tree to see if it continued but lost sight, perhaps because my contacts were so dry it forced me to blink repeatedly.  The object itself was a bright light, light yellow in color. I thought it was white at first, but I think there was some yellow in it. It was a circle, maybe a bit oval in shape. I wasn't sure if it was my dry contacts, but it appeared to have left a short tail behind it, like a comet. Like previously stated, I could not hear any sounds emitted from the object. The size of the light was much larger than any airplane lights, helicopter light, or shooting star that I have ever witnessed. The entire incident lasted about 3 seconds. I saw no deviation from a straight path heading due north, maybe north and slightly east. It appeared to be descending, although that may have been it traveling away from my position. If I had to venture a guess based on size where it was flying over I would say somewhere over the north end of Lake Washington, maybe farther east.",

The object was glowing and almost looking like a full moon that was on fire. Slightly above and to the north was another light that moved in slow, tight turns very close to the larger object. After about 45 seconds, the object began to change shape, it became more compact, almost as if it was flying away from us, and in less than 10 seconds, it was gone. There was nothing left behind in the sky. After experiencing that, my friend and I tried to think of every option of what it could have been and still cannot come to any conclusions. After posting a bulletin asking if anyone else had seen the object, a friend who lives in the area said he heard a loud \"electric/static\" sound and flashing orange lights out his window. Although he did not see anything, he says it seems as though a nearby house was on fire and there were lots of emergency vehicles with flashing lights, then suddenly disappeared  and the sound was gone.",

Saturday morning 1/13/07 around 3:00am  looking due west from the beach in West Seattle toward Blake Island, I noticed something emitting bright red and green lights through some amount of cloud cover, that I assumed to be an approaching aircraft.    But the red/green lights didn't advance, so  I noted the position in the sky, lining it up between a white flashing marine beacon and other lights on Blake Island.  It seemed stationary.   With binoculars I could see that the body of the light was chartreuse green, surrounded by red lights.  It may have been round.  It seemed to emit green flashes of light, reminding me of a 4th of July firework, where separate streams of light shoot out geyser-like, all at once, arcing in different directions. The red lights didn't seem to flash like the center chartreuse green light.   The object seemed located much above and beyond Blake Island, at a position of about one o'clock from the center of the island.  I noticed another similar stationary red/green light at a position of about three o'clock in the sky, that wasn't irridescent or flashing.   I watched these lights for about 45 minutes before going to bed.  What with the unusually cold temperatures, I thought it might have been a phenomenon caused by ice in the air - although the stars visible that morning were unremarkable.

P.D.T.).  Object: Possibly a Meteor coming down to Earth, teardrop shaped (round with short pointed tail).  Coloration: very bright yellow (with duller yellow blotches).  Size: nearly the size of the Moon (which was in the Southern sky), possibly 3/4 to the size of a full Moon.  Azimuth: Using North as zero (0\u00b0), to South (180\u00b0), and therefore East (90\u00b0), the object was at first spotted at nearly 100\u00b0 and by the time it disappeared over the horizon, it was perhaps 95\u00b0 azimuth (Left to Right, it was just slightly more to our Right from straight ahead).  Angle of Elevation: closer to 35\u00b0 than 30 when first spotted, and dropping to about 25\u00b0 or 20\u00b0 behind the horizon.  Duration: It was a couple of seconds before I discounted it as not being a reflected glare, and then close to 12 seconds of active watching (while driving, as there was no place to pull over and it was easy to watch while driving as it was so low now and just right of straight ahead). The distance was impossible to tell, but it had the illusion of dropping out toward North Bend or Lake Sammamish.  After: As it disappeared from sight, I called a friend who lives on the West shore of Lake Sammamish to see if they were ok, and to see if they had seen it.  They had there back to the east deck window and had seen it get very bright and then turned to see it glowing over the East horizon.  As they went outside, they heard neighbors talking on their docks asking each other, \"What the heck was that?\"  Reporting: I called information for ideas of who to report this to ... I left a message at a Meteor organization in Kent, and then called and left a message at the University of Washington Astronomy Department in Seattle, and then called and spoke with Jennifer at KIRO Radio (710AM) in Seattle, who suggested I also report the event to the folks here at UFOCenter.com (and thank you for your kind call!) even if it was a meteor or such, as it had not yet been identified as such.  POV: My point of view was driving Easterly on the Evergreen Bridge (Hwy 520) from Seattle, Washington toward Lake Sammamish just East of the center of the bridge when I noticed one very large yellow circular shape appearing to drop from the sky slightly to the East-Southeast side of the bridge, but still almost as high as the moon which was in the Southern sky.  I moved my head around a bit to be sure it was not simply a glare on the windshield, but it kept its path in spite of my dramatic movements. My passenger was also astonished at what we were seeing; as it was so large and not shooting \"across\" the sky as stars sometimes do (my passenger is an adult female, about my age).  Personal Info:  My name is Tim Oldfield, I'm 51 years of age ... back in college to work toward my Masters Degree ... just got my eyes checked at the optometrist 3 weeks ago and they are fine and unchanged (and I have fresh contacts on).   My email is TimO@WayneResearch.com and my mobile phone number is 505 650 0223 (New Mexico number, but I live back in the Seattle area).

The moon (almost full/full?) had just rose of the neighbors house.  The clouds were patchy.  I could see from the direction I was sitting (southernly) the Moon to my left and 2 planets (Venus,  Jupiter?) in the middle/right of my field of vision.  I looked up and noticed 2 slightly brighter lights in the sky about an inch apart between the planets.   I then made a mention that it was very strange those stars weren't there before, to which the 2 friends looked up, saw and verified them.  At this time, one of my friends noticed they were both moving (at same speed, maintaining the inch or so apart).  As they moved northernly, they became darker. And within 30 seconds, they were gone.   The speed at which the lights were going was much too slow to be a plane or satellite, and too bright for it to be a pair of helicopters and not be heard.   Curious to see if others saw the same thing!",

My wife is a lab tech at a pathology lab, and I work in library management.  On the evening of January 23, 2007 at approximately 8:55 p.m., we were standing on the back deck of the duplex we live in,  which is on the 2nd floor.  From there we have a fairly unobstructed view of the sky.  We also have a good view of airplanes coming in from the North and heading South for landing approaches at SeaTac airport.  We were talking and watching planes, when I leaned my head back to stretch my neck and saw two red balls of light flying parallel to each other heading from East to West.  They were at an altitude higher than the incoming planes, but lower than high flying jets.  There were both blood red in color with a slight diffusion of light around their centers.  No structure to either was visible.  They appeared identical, and the size of the lights was approximately twice that of the landing lights on low flying aircraft. As they traveled side by side from East to West  their paths were converging, but they did not meet. From my perspective, when they were approximately over downtown Seattle the two lights vanished.  My wife said that she saw them briefly begin to climb and then they were gone from view.  The sighting lasted a little over three seconds and we couldn\u2019t hear any noise that seemed associated with the two lights. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be unusually objective and eloquent in his description of the event.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD))",

So it may have been something from Boeing -- who knows. But after six months living here, this is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen, and we see a lot of flying craft passing over the lake. Around 10:45 p.m. a flashing white light caught my eye.  It looked like a strobe light and was moving north to south quickly. I thought at first it was a police light but realized it was in the air, not on a street on Mercer Island as first thought.  My husband and I went out onto our back deck to get a better look, and the light suddenly reversed direction, moving from south to north.  My husband said, \"Oh my god, look how fast it's going!\"  Then the light moved as if it were coming toward us (west).  Then it moved southwest over our house and disappeared from our view. Whatever it was sounded like a plane, not a helicopter, but there were none of the blue or red flashing lights you usually see on plane wings; it was just a white light that would come completely on, the go completely off, so you couldn't see it at all in the split-second that the light was off. Just after this light disappeared, two planes appeared to the north and the difference was marked -- their lights appeared more yellow and they appeared to be moving much slower than whatever else we saw. Anyway, it was different, so there it is. Thanks.",

      "story": "flaming ball moves slow and turns on a dime About 6:20 PM, Saturday Nov. 15, 2008 I walked out onto my porch to have a cigarette. While I was lighting it I looked up and saw a dark area with an immensely large orange light towards its rear. I thought \"wow, that plane has HUGE lights\" and continued my smoking. While I watched it slowly move eastward (my porch faces south) something didn't seem quite right as the orange glow was Way too large and a plane would have not taken that long to travel such a short distance as it had. If I had to guess general location, I would say coming from the west, south of Bremerton but north of Tacoma in a straight path eastward. So I went inside, told my husband that something just isn't right with this thing I've been watching, it looks like its on fire, and pulled out the binoculars. As I focused in for a closer look, my husband came out to see what i was talking about. The plane/dark object indeed seemed to have the entire tail end of it encased in an orange flaming mass (round mass, mind you.. there were no tendrils or trails.. more like liquid fire contained in a glass ball). I handed the binoculars to my husband who took a long look as well. I thought maybe I should call the airport, then thought that they would probably have a dead-on view of it anyway. We sat and watched it continue eastward .. it seemed to slow and then just 'hang' in the sky for about 10 seconds before heading straight south.  It did not turn south, it ended its eastward movement and began its southward movement (the phrase 'turn on a dime' comes to mind). If I held my arms out in front of me with one finger at the point where I first notice this object and the other where the eastward movement terminated.. it measures a measly 15-16 inches between. Thus far it has been a good 20 minutes. The southward movement was faster than the eastward. It seemed it would pass directly over Tacoma, the bright ball getting somewhat smaller as it went. When it looked as though it was flying over the Centralia/Chehalis area, the fire went out but I could barely make out a dark grey/black dot which seemed to descend rapidly for a second before I couldn't see it anymore. I don't know if anyone else saw this... but I'm sure someone had to have seen it. I contacted King 5 news via their tip line.. but never heard anything.",

The sun was setting so I was staring at the horizon enjoying the evening. I saw what appeared to be a very large star on the southwest horizon.  I pointed it out to my boyfriend who said it seemed too large to be a star.  We considered it might be a plane, though the light was consistently a glaring white and it appeared to be stationary.  We also discussed the possibility that it was Venus, though it was still light enough outside  I didn't believe Venus could shine that brightly. We watched the object for almost 10 minutes, the light never varied in intensity, it didn't appear to move, and slowly my boyfriend lost interest.  He turned away from the edge of his deck to face me.  As he turned around, the object made a swift and increadibly unexpexted swoop to the north.  Flying faster than any commercial aircraft I've ever seen, the object vanished behind trees to the north within seconds.  There appeared to be solid red lights on the object from this angle.  I caught my boyfriend's attention just in time for him to catch the object's departure.   We were both amazed and shocked by what we had witnessed.

( the Olympics are about 40-50 miles west of Seattle) It was a cold beautiful night, lots of stars and a few clouds at the base of the Olympics. At the southern part of the mountain range I saw a shooting star falling hard and fast from the sky . I thought \u201ccool\u201d I\u2019m going to make a wish! The star started to intensify getting brighter. I began to think to myself \u201cWOW, that thing is going to smash into the mountains and there\u2019s going to be a huge flash\u201d But as  it came down, it stopped abruptly halfway down the mountain range, turned a glowing red and shot horizontally northward. The red light never blinked or changed color. It moved so fast that I could not believe what I was seeing!? It moved faster than anything I have ever seen. As it moved, it illuminated the cloud formations nestled along the lower side of the mountain range.

Faint amber lights were spread across it, perhaps 10 or 20 in total.  The object was perhaps twice the diameter of the moon in width.

At first I thought it was exhaust from a plan, but as I looked closer, I saw that it was completely straight and appeared like it could be a floating cylinder in the sky, maybe about the length of 3 or 4 planes - hard to judge distance and actual size. I stared at it for about 2 or 3 minutes, when I realized I should run inside to grab my phone to take a picture, I usually have my phone on me at all times! 20 seconds later when I came back it was gone.

I would also like to preface my report by saying that over the past few months, I have taken more of an active interest in the UFO phenomenon and its associated conspiracy theories. I find myself looking more into the skies as my belief system is changing as more and more reliable sources and disclosers are coming forward. Also in this report, I make no speculation as to what I might have seen; it is simply a report of my observation at the time. On Friday, November 21 at approximately 7:30 pm, I and my wife were driving to Seattle from the Eastside. We were driving east on I-90 across the floating bridge between Mercer Island and Seattle. The skies were clear that evening and the brightest stars were appearing. On such on occasion, I look more carefully into the skies. I was driving and my wife was riding. I noticed the heavy flight traffic as many airliners were landing with a southerly approach to SeaTac airport over downtown Seattle. As I was watching the planes come in, I noticed that in the approximate vicinity of the airport, at about 10 o\u2019clock from my perspective somewhere between 35 and 40 degrees in the sky, I noticed a reddish light strobing slowly on and off (at intervals of 1-2 seconds on, 1-2 seconds off).  I could make out no discernible shape, and it seemed very far away, perhaps over the airport, but extremely high in the sky (I noted the object relative to the altitude of incoming aircraft).  It was a static object and reminded me of the red strobes of construction cranes.  However, there are no cranes in that direction and it was impossibly high in the air for a land-based construction.  My impression was that it was unlikely a helicopter, because relative to the air traffic it was higher than any helicopter flight I had witnessed. The drive across the bridge, on which I had a great view (traffic was light that evening, allowing me to look around a bit).  I kept watching for the two minutes across the bridge.  Once in Seattle, we made our way (5-7 minutes) to Capitol Hill where we parked and went to a concert.  Once out of the car, I could see at one point along the streets that the red blinking light was still in place. I did not mention it to my wife as I wanted to think through it before blurting out what I saw.  Today, we happened to meet a friend and the topic of UFO\u2019s came up, which brought the memory back.  I decided to report my impressions hoping that others might have seen the same thing.  It was early enough and clear enough skies that there would have been plenty of opportunity for others to see the same thing.  I noticed the light for at least 10-12 minutes from the time I saw it on the bridge to the time we drove into town and parked.",

      "story": "Three Red/Orange hovering lights in the Seattle metro area On the evening of July 4th, sometime between 11 and 11:30pm, I stepped out onto my balcony to have a cigarette. While there, I witnessed an object travelling from the east at a slow speed, at a relatively low altitude (higher than a sea place off Lake Union, lower than a jet taking off from Sea-Tac, if that makes any sense). I could not make out the general shape of the object, but did observe that it had one large red light, and a smaller orange light next to, and seemingly behind, the red one. The object executed a shallow turn, gradually heading south. It suddenly appeared to stop, and hovered for several seconds. About this time, an identical object came from same direction, following a seemingly identical flight path. It also stopped, and hovered slightly behind the first object. After it began to hover, a third identical object came into view, and fell into formation behind the previous two. The three objects hovered in what I can only describe as a loose crescent formation, for at least 30 seconds. Shortly after the appearance of the 3rd object, I stuck my head in the apartment and told my roommate they should come and see this. They came outside, and witnessed a good deal of the event. Sometime after the 30 second mark, the first object floated upwards and disappeared. Following this, the remaining objects moved closer together, and almost seemed to touch one another. They then separated, hovered for a few more seconds, and finally drifted upwards and disappeared as well. I would estimate the entire event, from the appearance of the first object to the disappearance of the latter two, was about 90 seconds to 2 minutes in duration. Though, frankly, it's difficult to say as I was more than a little surprised to be seeing this, and thus wasn't paying attention to the time. These clearly were not fireworks of any kind. Also, the lights on these objects were not consistent with what I've witnessed on traditional aircraft. There was no white/clear light, and none of the lights on the objects blinked or flashed at any time. They were also silent, and seemed to have a slight \"wiggle\" in their movements. There's a lot of air traffic in my area, so I see planes and helicopters every day. I feel safe in saying these objects were very odd, in both their behavior and appearance.

They were almost directly over us to the west.  We were in a neighborhood mixed with residential and industrial buildings.

I was walking down the street with a close friend of mine when I saw a extremely bright light moving east in the sky, I know it wasn't a plane because it was so bright and there was absolutely no blinking. I figured it was a satellite, but it was huge, easily 3/4 of a centimeter in diameter, and BRIGHT, we watched it move in a straight line east for almost a minute then everything changed it started accelerating for another 10-20 seconds then it briefly stopped, for just a moment, maybe half second then it headed east again. But now it wasn't moving in a straight line it was boosting; kind of swerving but every time it made a movement not eastward it was really fast. It was also kind of pulsing or breathing the; light never got darker, just brighter then back to normal. By this time it had moved from kind of over head/off my right temple at 2 o'clock; to 3/4 maybe less of the sky towards the horizon. At that point it was about to become obstructed by trees so i jumped on my bike and went as fast as i could to get a better view. i got to a clearing in the trees on my street and there it was still moving east i watched for another 5 seconds before a more white/blue, like a clean white color (as apposed to the color of the rest of it which was more of a white/yellow) beam came from the center of it, the beam was 1 1/2 centimeters long and from where i was almost paper thin looking like a millimeter in width, it continued east still swerving with the beam for another 10-15 seconds it was almost to the horizon and i lost it in some trees. whole sighting lasted between 2-3 minutes.

      "story": "Sighting through photographs The first thing I should say is that this craft was not visible by the naked eye.  I was taking photographs on 7/7/08 at approximately 8:07pm of the view from my balcony. The sun was just going down and the moon was visible at one end of the sky and the sun setting behind some mountains on the other side. There was not a cloud in the sky. It was still light out (sea blue sky). After taking the initial photo I checked it in the review screen (digital camera)and saw that there was an object in the picture that did not appear to have been in the sky at the time I took the picture, or afterwards, when I checked the sky.  I took 4 more photos and the craft is present in 3 of the shots. In the remaining 2 there is a cloud that seems to have \"absorbed\" the craft. Upon enlarging the photos and examining the details, I found that this almost perfectly circular cloud was present to the lower right of the craft in all of the photos that had the craft in them.  Upon examining the photos in the order they were taken, in the first three, the craft seems to have moved in a v pattern in the sky. Then in the fourth the cloud becomes prominent and the craft is gone. This is more evident in the fifth shot, where the cloud is seen very prominently at the top of the photo as if it was rising upwards.  The following night I took more photographs of the same area and although I did in fact capture this cloud once again, the same craft does not appear to have been present at that time. Although two smaller objects, that were present in the 7/7/08 shots, were in fact visible and were photographed on this day as well. I did visibly see in the sky, which did not move in conjunction with regular star patterns.  Upon enlargement of the 7/7/08 photos, what may be the most clear view of an unknown craft can be seen. It appears to have changed its alignment in all three photos. In one it appears to be two diamond shaped objects that are connected at some center point. There is a light on each side (almost as if a flame exhaust) that obscures detail of the craft and it is a brilliant white in the center with a almost electric blue peaking at the top and at the bottom.  In the second photograph, the vessel is more prominent and appears to be more like two Isosceles triangles on the sides connected by a tube or cone like center. The lighting on the craft is more of a greenish white on both sides at what would be the base of the triangles, which escalates into a definite electric blue at the tips. the center seems to be reflecting the light from the sides. the final photo (which is actually the second) gives the clearest view of all. It would appear to be two side propulsion elements attached to a main structure in the center. The sides appear to be shaped like the front of a clothes iron with the exact detail of the center is definitely rounded in some way, but is obscured somewhat by the light emanating from the sides. The entire craft has a green glow to it, that seems to come from two dome like elements atop the side structures. They glow the color of a green GE \"party bulb\"and have an electric blue \"aura\" above them. i would like to include a website where the pictures have been posted as well as a video I am in the process of making with closeup shots of the craft, however to keep anonymity, I obviously can not. I will check this site more closely to see if there is some way I can link the site to this site or have the link posted.  I have over 1000 photographs of the same area and am diligently examining all them ( I have already found additional images that may contain a similar, or the same object and/or its lighting track.) This is absolutely not lens glare a reflective surface or any other such camera \"tricks\" that are frequently attributed to such photos. The photos were all taken at 100 ISO which would have required the objects to be remaining relatively still (or moving very slow) due to the shutter speed. Photographs of airplanes moving through the air taken at this setting, will appear as a streak of light in the sky.  I have your e-mail and will submit some photos to add to this report after they have been properly processed.",

I was with friends but didn't think to tell them as everyone would say they were fireworks (which would be a very logical conclusion, given the time and place). It wasn't until I read reports here on the NUFORC website that I even thought twice about the event.  If people from various parts of Washington all saw these lights at roughly the same time, the lights must have been higher than flares or fireworks.

The object was described as being directly overhead.  Weather conditions were very clear, estimated tempature was low 70's.  Witnesses reported a light wind from the southwest.  Due to the clarity of the skies, witnesses had difficulty in determining scale and altitude. It was estimated to be about the size of a quarter coin when compared against a human hand held up in comparison. The witnesses were quite certain that the object remained motionless for several minutes, as if hovering.  During the event, they saw what appeared to be a commercial airliner flying near the object at a much higher altitiude. The object was a third smaller than the aircraft as it transited the area. The object displayed no movement, appeared to be light colored, with a haze around it. The object reportedly changed from round to a tubular or cigar shape.  No noise could be associated with the object.  Witnesses appeared to be credible, lucid and sober. This area is very populated with commercial aircraft.

I notice a stationary back dot in the sky above Providence Hospital with grey clouds for a background. I told my wife, and she spotted it with my help. After watching it for a while, I decided to run inside and get my old video camera. I videotaped it with my elbows braced on the deck so I could show it's movement. At about the time I started filming it, it started drifting(?) to the east on a horizontal plain. At one point I tried to zoom out to get some scale and perspective, but lost it when I tried to zoom back in. After viewing the video on my big screen, you can see an object arching beneath the main object. It's hard to describe. Though even on the big screen the main object looks like a shapeless black object. I showed it to a bunch of friends last night, and they insisted the I have a expert look at the video. Hence this contact. I have yet to transfer the video to a digital form. My firewire card is not working. My background: I love physics and astronomy, and so I have a hard time believing we are being visited by other life forms....sorry. But I do believe in the term UFO. I was in Phoenix when the \"Phoenix Lights\" occurred, and I witnessed them from an overpass (Dunlap & I-17). I still believe they were government related. This may too be the case.",

      "story": "Bright, flickering orange light Walking southward on sidewalk, coming back from taking out garbage. Saw to SE (over neighbor's house) object, about 30 degrees elevation, first thought it was aircraft with landing lights. Single bright light, orange/red similar to color of sodium lights moving slowly toward me (moving to the north west). Light was flickering irregularly but not blinking in a pattern, no other color lights seen. No sound from object, closing from ~ 4nm to 2nm (estimated based on ceiling and elevation, \"2nm\" being about 11,000' directly overhead). Single-engine propeller aircraft heard to the northwest, apparently over water, but not correlated to the object. Based on altitude of 11,000' (reported ceiling) speed credible for either jet or turboprop aircraft, not credible for balloon (too fast) or meteor (too slow). Also based on observation that object entered cloud cover from below and did not emerge from it, object assumed to be gaining in altitude throughout observation. Went inside to get binoculars (just inside front door) and 10-y/o daughter. Went back out, object still visible, now moving \"faster\" (probably same speed but closer), now clearly having turned perhaps 45 degrees to the left and moving toward the west. Nearly overhead, observed with binoculars, slowly disappeared into clouds. Still no sound. Not seen again. Flight path not consistent with Boeing Field or Seatac. McChord AFB possible but unlikely. Note: Both Weather Underground site (copied below) and Boeing Field report clear skies, but actually heavily overcast, altostratus. Weather Underground also reports light northerly wind, but actual observation was southerly at 5 knots. Daughter (10 years old), also had binoculars but was unable to get them out of case in time and only saw it with unaided eyes, descibes as \"a fireball in the sky, like a very very furry animal's tail, while the animal's tail was poofed up, like a very angry cat's tail\". Note: Daughter did not see object (she had been inside) until it was entering the clouds, I think this is what she means. Prior to that the object was a very distinct single source of light. Other than the fact that the object was not in a typical flight path, nothing about it's movement or speed seemed irregular for a conventional jet or turboprop aircraft. What was striking was it's coloration, and the fact that it was clearly flickering or flaring, but not \"blinking\" in any regular pattern. Also substantially brighter than conventional aircraft. Personal Background: Ex-Navy (navigation), captain US Merchant Marine, celestial navigation instructor, astronomy major in college (i.e., no, it wasn't Venus, a meteor or the ISS). Daughter is a typical ten-year-old, but has been stargazing with me since she was a toddler. Note: Your form asks for shape and number of \"craft\". I do not presume to know if this is a \"craft\" or a natural phenomenon or something else entirely. Just because we see an unusual light in the sky doesn't necessarily mean space-aliens are riding in it.  ============================================================= Weather Report from Weather Underground (www.wunderground.com)  Updated: 3 sec ago (2032pst) Clear \t(actually overcast, dense altostratus) 56.9 \u00b0F Humidity: \t47% Dew Point: \t37 \u00b0F Wind: \t4.0 mph from the North (actually about 5kts from south/southwest) Wind Gust: \t8.0 mph Pressure: \t29.12 in (Falling) Visibility: \t10.0 miles UV: \t0 out of 16 Clouds: \t Clear - (Above Ground Level) Elevation: \t30 ft",

      "story": "Bright hot object leaving trail over Seattle in early morning of December 2nd, 2009 I am quite used to seeing planes coming in from the north low in the sky as they prepare to descend onto the Sea-Tac airport, flying by on frequency of maybe one or two every thirty minutes. Their lights catch my attention but are usually no brighter than passing headlights on the highway. From my eastern facing position they cruise across my view from north to south. However Last night at exactly 3:24 a.m. the sky lit up from an object streaking across the sky from west to east. It was moving at a considerable pace and was quite different than the objects I am used to seeing out this window. If you can say that the sun in the sky is about the size of a quarter were you to hold one up in the air, this object was about the size of a lentil bean in that perspective. Unlike the lights of the planes which have a cool value to their hue this object was warm and bright like an arc weld almost too bright to look at. This brightness caused a halo effect around the object which tapered off into a streaking tail which dithered behind it. When I say this object was bright I mean that it lit up the sky and the buildings in first hill. It was bright enough to illuminate the facing walls of the taller buildings, the roofs as it passed over head and to silhouette the buildings as it passed to their opposite sides. The brightness was enough to catch my attention away from my computer screen and I had just enough time to stand up in disbelief and watch it cruise past the buildings as stated heading east. The angle of entry was more level with the horizon than steep otherwise I am convinced it would have hit the tallest building in my view. Of course that is dependent on my relative position and perspective to the event, I actually do not know how high or how big this object actually was though I relate here to you my best account of what I viewed. It was enough though to scare my cat out of the window and into hiding. The event lasted 5 to 10 seconds I estimate and I did not have time to photograph the event. I make no assumptions as to what I saw.

The object, about 35 degrees above the horizon, appearing bigger than a star or planet but smaller than the moon, was moving quickly and soundlessly on a level path from south to north, eventually disappearing behind a cloud.  The object was orange in color, glowing softly in the setting sun, and was shaped like a slightly elongated ball or globe, although rounder on the top and flatter on the bottom.

On the night of March 20, 2009 in Seattle, Washington I sat with my husband smoking a cigarette on our porch looking up at the sky. I noticed a bright light moving fairly quick, flying much higher than an airplane. I told my husband to take a look at it and he mentioned that it was probably a satellite, although it was much too low and moving much too fast to be a satellite. We watched it move east, and my husband then decided it was a high flying airplane, but then we noticed it move in front of a low altitude cloud. Meanwhile a descending airplane flew south above us and when the strange light intersected the path of the airplane it stopped and then quickly shot off to the west. When we came back out an hour later, the temperature had dropped significantly and I had become nauseous and my husband began to shake. We noticed that there was a lot of movement up above, lights flying past quickly, as well as several much brighter shifting lights in triangular formations. There were multiple sets of these formations. These were not stars because the lights that seemed to be hovering were not covered by passing clouds. My husband describes witnessing several lights emitting other, lesser lights. They did this in such a way that it seemed they were arching out of the bright light in symmetry. This seemed to be happening around, inside, and above faint clouds. We both thought these clouds were strange. The clouds seemed teaming with activity. Some lights just hovered in one spot, some would rock back and forth, other would rise softly and drop dramatically, sweeping away into the horizon, much like the very first light we saw. All these lights moved gracefully and moved at incredibly fast rates. We also noticed that some of these lights seemed to shake softly, in the way a pen would move across paper while writing. We kept watching this, and the activity never seemed to let up. We became colder and more nauseated and had to go back inside. Once inside, we felt drained of our energy and fell asleep quickly in all our clothes, and slept uninterrupted for the next 10 hours.",

      "story": "Strange low flying lights over Seward Park in Seattle, Washington on March 25, 2009. OK, this was a strange night.  After walking my dog at Seward Park, we sat at the picnic table near the clay studio so my dog could have his treat break.  It was about 8:00 p.m., the sun had already set and the stars were finally coming out.  I'm fascinated with stars and as usual, I am looking up at the Big Dipper in the Northeast direction.  As I glanced at the I-90 Bridge, a flash of light caught my eye above and north of me.  I noticed that there was a small light followed by a larger light flying directly behind the smaller light, if I had to guess, the lights seem to be four blocks apart from one another, it was moving slowing to the east and it didn't seem to be more that 600-800 feet above the evergreen trees of the park.  As I pondered where the these planes came from and why they were so low, I realized that they were too close to be flying behind one another.  I noticed that they moved at the same speed and the distance between the two lights never shifted but remained straight across from one another.  In addition, there were no strobe lights as there are on all airplanes and helicopter's (as far as I know) and the most amazing thing was that there was absolutely no sound at all.  All this I described happened within a minute of me noticing the lights and I was chatting with my mom on the phone at the time and told her I was pretty sure I was seeing a actual UFO.  Although it was not completely dark I could see there was no outline of a vehicle between the two lights, however, it was just too strange that the lights moved as if they were connected to something.  The only example I can offer is this, if you see a ship on the ocean at night and there was a light on the front of the ship and another on the back of the ship, you would not see the ship but you\u2019d know that there must be a ship out there because the light spacing never changes.  I could see that the larger light was globe like with either vents of blue light or some feature that I was unable to clearly make out at t! he dista nce I was at. However, I could see there was something more to the light.  As the UFO disappeared over the tree going east, my mom grabbed her camera and because her house sits on a hill over near the airport she was able to see the lights as I had described and she said that she could see them going a little below the tops of the Cascade Mountains going south.  Then she lost them.  A minute later she was again able to see the two lights heading south.  They still appeared to be near the Cascade Mountains.  I hope there was others who reported this because it was truly an amazing sight for me and I will always regret not carrying my camera or binoculars.  The observer is an accountant.",

I stepped out to take out the trash at 10p tonight, looked up to find the dipper and was surprised the sky was so clear. I saw the dipper almost immediately, then my eyes traveled over to the NW...  I first saw a consistently moving satellite moving left to right, then I was struck by a blue red and white\u2026lit-up object that was moving in a pattern I had never seen before. This object looked much like a typical star or planet initially. It moved left, then right, then in a semi-circular motion. It was slightly larger than a star and seemed to be very high in the sky, because it was difficult see it clearly.  The two most peculiar aspects of this object were the movements and the change of shape and color. It moved quickly in a swirling motion as well as at sharp angles before stopping completely and not moving at all. It at times moved slowly too.  It moved then stopped, then moved again with a very inconsistent frequency. At points, the object appeared to twist, or rotate to expose a three-light cluster. The colors changed at inconsistent intervals\u2026nothing like an airplane. It was also unlike the flickering of any star I have seen",

I was facing north looking out over the parking lot when I noticed a very bright greenish light appear suddenly over Phinney Ridge for about two seconds in my line of site above the parking lot, then floated for about 2 seconds to the northwest and then disappeared just above the light of sight beyond the tree at the north-west side of the parking lot. I immediately shouted out, \u201choly s**t did you guys just see that.\u201d Except for one of the guys seeing something out of the corner of his eye, no one else did. This was not a huge surprise as I was the only one facing north. The sky was still quite light to the northwest and there were small scattered high clouds in the sky. From what I remember the light appeared to be well in front of the clouds, so I do not think it was a meteor. I have never seen a meteor at dusk. If it was a meteor, it was perhaps the brightest one that I have ever seen and it had a greenish tint to it. I would say it had a magnitude of brightness perhaps 5 times as bright as Mars when it is the closest to earth. I watch the Seattle skyline when I go out for walks in the evenings and am familiar with the flight patterns and the lights on the helicopters and airplanes flying above Seattle. I actually scan the skyline for any unusual moving lights or objects. The normal lights move at a snails pace compared to this light. This light just showed up out of nowhere, then disappeared. I have never seen a light moving like this above Seattle or any sky anywhere.",

The park overlooked Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountain Range to the west.   I happened to look up and saw a bright, oval-shaped object coming down from the upper atmosphere. There was no sound of motors.  The object had no wings.  The object made a very sharp almost 90-degree turn to the horizontal and then sped south along Puget Sound at high speed and towards Mt. St. Helens.  I was very surprised.   At about the same time on July 4, 1947, a Seattle bus driver and U.S.Navy member saw similar objects over Seattle.   On June 24, 1947, a light plane pilot and a prospector saw nine silvery flying saucers flying in line at high speed from north to south  over nearby Mount Rainier and Mount Adams, Washington. On July 4, 1947, two airline pilots and a stewardess saw similar nine flying saucers flying from southeast to northwest from Boise, Idaho, towards Mount Rainier and Seattle.

Watched it the first one fly over.  It had more lights on it, could not make out it's actual shape.  could not even accurately describe it as an airplane, because the lights didn't seem configure in what i assume to be a \"typical\" manner.  shortly after first one advanced overhead the other one suddenly sped up and appeared to smoothly \"zoom\" across the same path.  I believe they were headed SW.  I thought th! ere was a humming noise, but there was a low flying jet that flew from the complete, opposite direction.   It seemed to intersect it's path and did have a different sound, but it muffled any noise i tried to distinguish from the two objects.

They were very slowly falling, approximately equidistant from one another and the planet. Their motion reminded me of the slow drift of a flare in the sky, though this most certainly was not anything like a flare. I stopped my bike to watch and my heart began to race as I realized they were not airplanes. I have lived in this city my whole life and am very keenly aware of the flight paths over the city, as well as the movement of lights emitted from airplanes. These two lights were very far away, extremely bright white and not flashing or irregular in any way. They paused their motion for a moment, then rapidly \"flew\" away into the distance, with a trajectory that made them appear to be moving directly away from me. (No lateral movement.) The whole sighting took approximately 5 seconds. Of course, I don't know what I saw but I can say with great certainty that I have NEVER seen anything move that way in the sky.

The object was about 50-100 feet long and stayed just above tree level. The object was silent but periodically made a low pitched sound (like a low growling noise).  It slowly floated from the trees and stopped in front us. The object hovered above Lake Washington for 10-15 minutes and drifted across the lake (east towards the city of Bellevue).  It looked like a blimp, but the core of the object looked fluid (like yellow orange and red lava).  There was a reddish black square that hung just below the object. The object was so close, that it produced an orange hue over all of us.  I also felt static electricity. The object slowly changed shape and orientation.  At one point, it looked as the object was tearing into the sky itself (its hard to explain). There were many witnesses at the park at that time; including a Metro bus driver on the #2 route.  Even boats in the water stopped to look at it.   I was 16 at the time, and I will never forget.  Whatever it was, it did not seem to be friendly.",

      "story": "V-Shaped Formation of Objects Over Seattle I'm a 43 year old graphic artist, and will email you my Photoshop interpretation of the sighting.  Please note that this is NOT a real photo but was drawn immediately after the sighting while my memory was very fresh. At 11:40pm I stepped out on my rooftop deck for a breath of air and to take in the view before bed. The deck faces south and offers a panoramic view of Seattle.  As I am located about a half mile from downtown, the glow of the city lights gave a subtle pinkish hue to the few scattered clouds in the sky.  There was no moon or wind of any kind, nor any sound except the faint drone of city traffic.    As my gaze drifted to the 40 degree Southwestern area of the sky I suddenly noticed a v-shaped squadron of about 8-10 pale whitish objects rapidly emerge from behind a cloud.  They were flying toward the Northeast at a very high rate of speed for their apparent very high altitude.  They caught my attention due to the oddly pale appearance, great speed and lack of any marking lights or sound.  It was hard to tell whether they were self-illuminated or merely reflecting the glow of the city lights as they were so pale.  The squadron was about the size of my index and middle fingers held at arm's length, from the tips to the knuckle.  The point of the V was at the prevailing tip of the formation. After about 10 seconds it reached the 90 degree position, so I turned to continue watching.  At this point I noticed that there were two additional objects of the same color, size and brightness off to the right of the formation.  These two objects were very close together and kept a perfect pace with the \"main v\", and were the distance of roughly five \"squadrons\" away.  At about 140 degrees northeast the objects became obscured by a cloud and I lost track of them as they were already getting very far away anyhow.  The time from the start of the sighting until the end was about 30 seconds. The flight path was perfectly straight and unwavering.  At no time did any of the objects deviate in position at all from the others, which indicated that possibly this could have been one gigantic triangle rather than separate objects.   At the exact moment that the formation disappeared, a passenger jet and small private plane came into view lower in the same section of the sky.  It was instantly obvious that the formation wasn't conventional aircraft because the jet and plane had all the usual lights and obvious sounds coming from them, and they were far brighter and more yellowish in color than the pale and dim white hue of the formation.",

      "story": "Bright Light with Tail SSE travel over N.W Region US 7:40 AM 12/29/2010 Viewed light on the way to work to the left of the moon.  Light visible in daylight. What was unusual about this was the light was high in the sky with a tail and not a planet.  This was not stationary.  My questions are three fold: 1) space station but why would it have a tail ?  2) Satellite in decaying orbit ? 3) Did we have a comet pass close by ?  And to add a forth given the recent reports - was this a high flier leaving a con-trail ?  (high flier being UFO as in unidentified object) not implying anything but 'unidentified'.  Flight path was straight and a SSE direction over the North West region and to the left of the crescent moon which at the time appeared overhead but in a Southerly 10 O'clock position, so not directly overhead. I am thinking space junk or Earth born stuff rather than other worldly craft. It was a bright light so you couldn't identify it as a craft with the naked eye and I didn't have binocs or telescope. I am a tech. and applicati! on Admin. Attention to detail is required.  Bare in mind I viewed this from a moving vehicle and could not stop to get a better look. So better details could not be gathered. Over the period of 1hr 1/2 commute the object was visible for 15 minutes as it wafted it's way South. I might note that the size never diminished as is the case with meteorites and this was not a flash of a meteorite. The size stayed the same relative to the distance of course as an object gets smaller over distance and time. It would be interesting to know what it was.",

The veiw over Puget Sound was amazing.  Just after sunset, yet not quite dusk, I noticed a brite yellow-white fireball streaking across the sky from the direction of the space needle toward the south west.  I know this was not a plane, it was too fast, and strobes were absent.   I also know it was not a sattleite, because it was too fast.  It's size was too large to be a hellicopter yet too small to be a plane.  It was missing wings and/or rotar.   The other thing that sets it apart is it was silent.  There were no fireworks going in the area muchl ess in that direction at that time.  The height in the air that it was flying was equivalent to that of plane not preparing to land. This fireball object was moving way slower than a meteor/falling star.  I am reporting this because I couldn't identify it, even with a military background.   I am truly stunned.

Tonight just after 9pm I was taking a break from the computer, looking out my window southerly towards the Seattle Center/Space Needle from my lower QAnne apt.  The night sky was clear with a full-moon; a balmy evening with excellent visibility and no clouds. I\u2019m on the top-floor of a 4 story building; the object appeared below the elevation of the Space Needle, and appeared to be centered over the Elliott Bay area, due west of downtown Seattle\u2026.approx. 10-15 degrees west of the Space Needle. I watched it for a few minutes, still not sure what I was seeing.  I thought maybe it was a plastic bag\u2026caught in a thermal\u2026but the movement was different:  it appeared to undulate\u2026.\u201cwobble\u201d\u2026..and moving slightly in a slip/sliding motion. The object made no noise, had no navigation lights, didn\u2019t move like a conventional man-made aircraft/rotor-craft\u2026and appeared to have a faceted/angular body style\u2026.pentagon-shaped, instead of being disc/saucer-like. I grabbed my camera and tripod, and photographed several shots from my apt. window area.  Despite the camera being secure, some of the imagery showed a blur\u2026indicating that the object was moving; it wasn\u2019t camera shake, etc. I then ran over to the top of the Seattle Center parking garage for a better vantage point.  The garage rooftop has an elevation approx. the same as my own apt\u2019s, but the object appeared to be lower in the horizon, still appearing to be over the Elliott Bay area, west downtown Seattle. I took an additional 10 or so shots from this vantage point.  The object finally dipped below a tree-line, obscuring my viewpoint and was no longer observable. I returned home, downloaded the digital files for review.  Successive frames showed movement from the object, because of the blurring it induced.  Again, the camera was on a tripod with a timer being used; there wasn\u2019t camera shake induced.  2-3 shots are relatively crisp\u2026and show the pentagon-shaped body; in others it appears to be almost an \u201cupside down hat\u201c, with more mass below the \u201cbrim\u201c.  The camera I was using, a Nikon Coolpix 8400 only has a limited zoom range, 24-85mm + tele-zoom, but I was still able to reveal a distinctive body shape.   Given the limited optics, and the relative crispness of a few of the images, I felt I could guesstimate the approximate area of it\u2019s hover\u2026which appeared to again, be over Elliott Bay.

It was hovering near the constellations of Cepheus and Cassiopea.  It was nearly motionless though it appeared to move vertically very slowly during the two minutes it was visible. The orange reddish light had a flickering appearance and was slightly larger than the apparent size of the ISS and was much less bright than the ISS.  My best guess on apparent magnitude would be roughly 1.0. After two minutes the light disappeared from sight.  The light made no sound and appeared to be roughly 2-4 miles away.  It had no navigation lights, anti-collision strobes or landing lights like the normal air traffic in this area.  The local visibility was excellent with no clouds in the sky and no haze.

      "story": "When space ships decend out of the stars and come down to earth very slowly, hardly anyone notices. July 7th 2010, 10:00pm  Walking down a street in western Seattle, I looked to the sky and saw a large bright gold object crossing the sky from east to west.  I watched it because it was unusually large and near to the earth.  The object suddenly began to fade away at a rapid speed and then turned red and disappeared altogether. Later that night, I saw four or five other bright objects zoom through the sky at an insane amount of speed.  Some of the objects would disappear and then reappear and others would turn from gold to gray.  At about 3:00am on the 8th of July I saw a brilliant light that appeared to be a golden magnetic energy rise from the earth until about two hundred feet off the ground at which point it stopped emitting the gold light and began to blink in a manner very similar to a commercial jet.  The object then blinked a pattern of red, green and blue lights, turned in my direction and then flew over my head.  I was unable to discern its shape.  It then flew away and as the distance between it and me increased, the blinking lights made the object look like a shimmering star.  But if you scrutinized it closely, you could tell it wasn\u2019t a star, but some form of advanced technological cloaking device.  Then I noticed there were other \u201cstars\u201d in the sky that blinked in a similar fashion.  As I watched these objects, some of them moved slowly through the sky, while others zoomed at very high speeds.  Then they objects would settle down again and mimic the stars. July 8th 2010, Dusk. Due to the prior night\u2019s events, I found a good viewing spot (the top of a hill in Wedgewood) and began watching the sky much earlier. From this vantage point I witnessed hundreds of these \"stars\" crept across the firmament and descended ever so slowly from the real stars to earth.  They moved so slowly that if I hadn\u2019t been anticipating the event and patiently watching, I never would have noticed. But I did notice.  And as the ships reached Earth the sun went down.  But just before it was totally dark, I caught a brief glimpse of one of these ships.  To my surprise it resembled a very sophisticated space-plane. It hummed soothingly.  The other ships then came in my direction traveling slow and low, but keeping their lights in a fashion as to mimic commercial jets.  Occasionally the light pattern would change into a sudden brilliant display of undulating red, green, blue and gold lights.  The ships then circled around Seattle for an hour or so, at which point some of them scattered! out in all directions, while others settled in the sky and mimicked the stars.  I stayed up all night watching the ships that remained.  Some had three lights and appeared to be triangular; others had four lights and appeared to be square. I got some footage with my cell phone.  But the quality is pretty low.  Also, they knew when I was about to take a picture because almost every time I raised my camera, they would change from what they were doing with the lights back to a commercial jet pattern.  I talked out loud and it was as if they could hear me.  For a while nothing particularly obviously out of this world happened. So I said, \"Okay, I\u2019ll but my camera away.\"  Then the ship nearest me did a good deal of rapid blinking and all of a sudden, to the south, I saw a golden light arise over Capitol Hill.  It neared me. When it flew past, I saw that it was another ship that had just come in.  Then I walked home and went to bed.",

My family and some friends walked south down our street to 34th Ave and Stone Way in Fremont to watch the fireworks show.  It was then approximately 9:50 pm and I noticed the same light in the sky.  This time the light was in a southwest position near the Aurora bridge and possibly 2 miles high in the air, I would say equal distance above Lake Union between Queen Ann hill and Fremont.  It seemed to hover in this area for 5 minutes and was much larger than an airplane light.   My family and friends commented on this orb of light with some other people waiting to see the fireworks show.  This was definitely not fireworks or other aircraft.  It stayed in one spot for 5 approximately mintues and then moved straight up in the sk! y.  The light was so bright it could be seen through the light clouds and was gone in about 10 seconds maybe less.   The light orb did not travel in any direction, just straight up.

I watched it for about ten minutes, and in that time it proceeded west into Scorpius and brightened by about one magnitude.  It was about 20 degrees above the horizon, and moved very slowly. I got the impression that it was at a great height. After ten minutes, my arms became fatigued from holding the heavy pair of binoculars.  I put them down for a few seconds.

      "story": "Glowing orange orb flying North to South across Lake Washington 10/31/2011 Dear Sir, I write to report the sighting of a flying  object that I was not able to identify on the evening of October 31st, 2011.  It was approximately 7:15 p.m. and I stepped out to get a breath of fresh air.  My deck faces East towards Lake Washington from Lake City Seattle. Upon having my attention directed to an orange object in the sky by my wife I observed a glowing orange orb moving from North to South across the sky at a high rate of speed over Lake Washington.  There were no flashing lights on the object and it was moving steadily at a rapid  speed across the horizon.  The object did not change direction and I observed it steadily for approximately 30 seconds until it disappeared behind the large trees in our yard. I would say that from the skyline the glowing orange orb was at an approximate angle of 40 degrees from tree line.  My best estimate at the size of the object would be that it was roughly 1/4th the size of a large full moon, or roughly as large as my thumbnail with my arm fully extended towards the sky.  The object did not emit a detectable sound. It is worth noting that about 15-20 minutes later an airplane flew directly overhead from moving from West to East.  Comparatively, the airplane was moving at a much slower speed. Later that evening I once again stepped out on the deck and was observing the sky due to the earlier occurrence.  Curiously, I spotted a similar looking object in the Southern sky.  This time the movement pattern was much different.  The object was much higher (roughly 75-80 degrees from tree line) and appeared to be much further away.  Still, the object was approximately two to four times larger than any star or planet in the sky.  This time the glowing orange orb was moving much slower and was zig-zagging East to West as it continued moving South.  My second observation lasted approximately 2-3 minutes until the object again moved behind tall trees that at last obscured my view.",

      "story": "Star-like light with humanly incapable flight pattern I frequently like to go outside or look out my window at the stars. A few times in the past five months. I have noticed what looked like stars (or indistinguishable from stars) flying across the night sky. The first time in August 2011, my girlfriend and I watched two fly across the night sky in the Nevada desert, about 100 miles North of Reno. They were far apart and were obviously not a single aircraft. The lights were traveling South-East to North-West at exactly the same rate of speed, never altering the distance between themselves. They took nearly twenty seconds to make their way out of our sight. The second sighting occurred in November 2011. I was walking to my car after eating at a McDonalds 16 miles South of Seattle, when I looked up and saw a single star-like light traveling across the night sky. I proceeded to watch the light for about one minute as it made it\u2019s way out of my range of sight. I immediately called my girlfriend to tell her. However, on Christmas night 2011, I was staring out my bedroom window (not far from the previously mentioned McDonalds) when I saw a star-like light flashing between white, red and blue while producing very peculiar flight patterns. The light would jolt randomly within a very small radius as it made a linear path across the night sky. The due path was South-East to North, while the jolts were sporadic in direction. The time for this light to traverse the night sky was also about one minute. I am sure this object was not an illusion produced by the lights on the underside of an airliner due to the elevation, the apparent movement of the single light and no appearance of aircraft body within the jolting radius. Also, a satellite has no way of producing this random jolting. This occurrence was by far one of the most bizarre things I have ever witnessed. I even woke my girlfriend up to ask if she could see what I was seeing and she was just as amazed as I was. IMPORTANT: NO SOUNDS WERE HEARD DURING ANY OF THE SIGHTINGS",

      "story": "3 orange orbs or fireballs fly in formation over Seattle (Capitol Hill/Madison Valley) on December 26, 2011 at around 2:17 AM. Last night, as I was walking the dog, I noticed a single orange light coming towards me from the southwest and traveling overhead to the northeastern part of the sky.  At first I thought it was some kind of low flying plane or helicopter, but it was fuzzy in appearance and flaring outward in all directions. It moved slowly. Soon afterwards it flew directly over me, and behind the cloud deck off to the northeast. Next about 20 seconds later, I saw two more orange lights traveling in formation, heading on the same course as the first object.  The two objects appeared from the same direction, same course, same speed, and same altitude, flying in a single file pattern. As I tried to get a closer look at them, I noticed that each was a fuzzy, glowing, light orange ball or orb. They did not appear to have any solid noticeable center, and their outlines were faint and semitransparent (almost halo-like). These objects made no sound at all, had no beacons or flashing! lights on them, and just seemed to float along. Their speed would be equivalent to a small plane or helicopter. They were not moving very fast. But these lights were definitely not aircraft. I have no idea how large they may have been or how far away they actually were. What is interesting is that when the objects were directly overhead, I noticed a slight wobble and floating movement (strange propulsion), in which one of objects moved slightly away from the other one, slowing down for a moment and then speeding up again to meet back in formation with the other object.  After a few seconds they continued to travel at the same speed towards the northeast.  My thoughts were that these two strange orange orbs were following, or catching up with the first orange orb.",

Our room was opposite side of the space needle. We were on the 3rd floor looking towards the freeway. Around 5pm that evening my husband was taking a nap, myself and my 2 children were looking out the window, watching all the aircrafts descending for landing.  We were also watching the local king 5 news helicopter taking off and landing. We watched the helicopter take off and go up and down the free way, and then land.  I guess it must have been around 5:45pm - 6pm when I was looking out the window and spotted a strange white/silvery ball to the upper right of the window. It looked like it was spinning and then a smaller black circle would appear and disappear, in the middle and to the bottom.  It was strangely odd.  I called my husband over; he saw it...we all saw it.  Just then a passenger aircraft passed right under it, a total near miss.  Judging by the size of the passenger jet, it was about the size of a car.  We watched it for about 5 minutes as it moved from the right of the window, to the left, diagonally going upwards, and into the clouds, then out of the atmosphere. I did try to take a picture with my iphone, but it couldn\u2019t pick it up.  I\u2019m certain we have see a UFO. I was just wondering if anyone had reported this.",

The craft would hover, then went north, came to the original spot, then moved west. Came back to original spot and hovered again. I still couldn't believe what I was seeing till a air plane showed and flew under the craft. The craft held still and I know it is not another air plane because of the size, lights and movement was not the same... and a air plain wouldn't fly under a helicopter. After 30 minutes staying in see able location the craft finally decides to move south east towards downtown Seattle where I saw a lot of airplanes surrounding the craft. I was thinking maybe they are trying to figure what was gong on. The craft continued to head south east.. and vanished.

In the sky, suddenly I heard a big bang, and as I looked up, at first I saw nothing. I really don't know how to describe what happend next.  A wave of relaxation sprung through my limbs and into my fingers. I could even fell the sting in my finger nails. It felt like when you fall asleep and accidently block the passage of blood to your arm, and a million ants start to crawl up the muscles, chewing away. As this happened, it was as if (and this part will sound most strange) me and this formation of people, suddenly felt the same thing. But not merely felt the relaxation, but felt instead  each other. As if there was a third arm infront of me, I would try to move it, but could not. Another bang interupted the flow and the most beautiful thing I've ever seen appeared infront of me. I could not begin to explain it. I can hardly even remember the shape of it, as if my brain is unable to fathom it's form. I feel strange even typing this. There were five of these things, and they flew perhaps a 1000 feet above us , watching. Seconds later, they were gone.  We just looked at each other, as if in denial, looked at each other with this look that I'll never forget, as if we were discusted with the other persons behaviour. As if the moment it happened, we didn't believe it. That is why I write this so late. I hope that others do the same, so that the story goes out.",

      "story": "Three Silver Unknown Objects Observed Over Western Seattle Sky While observing kites at a local park, my eyes caught a silver reflection westward and at very high altitude.  The object appeared almost stationary, though it would move briefly in small, circular patterns before again hovering in place.  It also seemed as if the object was surrounded by a reflective glare.   The sky was perfectly clear, aside from a scattered number of cirrus clouds to the far south-west.  I quickly pointed out the object to my partner who was also able to observe the object and its behavior.   After several minutes, I then noticed a second object of the same description, and then a third shortly after.  Neither of these appeared to have the same brightness or reflection as the first.   At this point, a commercial aircraft cut through the field of vision, though it was at a significantly lower elevation. The three objects remained stationery and when viewed together formed a large triangle shape.  The second object then moved southward, passing the first by a short distance, and then again became stationary.  All three objects remained in this position for several minutes.   I removed my sunglasses to determine whether or not what I was seeing could have possibly been a reflection in the lenses.  I was still able to observe the objects with the naked eye.  My partner was able to track two of the objects but lost sight of the third.  I lowered my eyes briefly in order to regain focus and reduce eye strain.   The first and second objects where no longer visible and could not be found in the surrounding sky field.  The third object, however, remained it its previous position.   I observed for another few moments before again lowering my eyes.  I was unable to then relocate the third object.   Total observation is estimated at 15 minutes.   Both observers are successful health care providers.  One is also an educator.",

They where looking for someone named the Omega.  They talked about several thing but I never saw who was talking and that I would know them because they would talk blended with the wind.   Then they wanted me to come outside so I did and when I walked outside I noticed that there was an eclipe created by the moon. When I heard voice that told me to look up and I saw a ship but it was barely visable.  Then the craft disappeared and tha was the last time I saw that craft.  A series a event happened like someone was test my knowledge of events of the past, present, and future.  There is a park close to my house where a voice asked me to come and me someone. It was four right angles as I was guided my the voice and when I came to the park   I was instructed to go in a certain direction an push a spot in an figure that leaned against a series of triangles,retangles, that leaned to th! e left.  Then I was to stand ther but before this had  happened I saw a native American supposely to be a tribal nation looked like the wrong tribe but the eyes looked diffent than I have seen before because the one I saw that was in the mall had eyes that were blue but with white kind like specks not like or iris's. So, first went the port-a- pot when I came out then I walked to that structure but nothing then I went an sat on then bench. It was raining lighting an a figure appeared the being was almost light grey but see through at the same time. The being looked me in my face an I remember looking down an seeing a tranlucent worm that had what looked like squres and tringles in side it's body. Then I turn to leave an the being was gone and I went back home. I also remember talking to someone or a family from the voice I heard was a kid,mother,father, grandpa. We had several coversation about various subjects.I remember also at the mall the other which apeared human as we ! know; was a brown haired woman she motioned towards a shirt bu! t didn't speak. I wasn't a weird was more like why was contacted but something went wrong. One minute I was sitting in the forest at night still talking to someone but I heard a noice an out the corn of my eye I was a slinder figure with long hair move across the path with quickness; then he was gone.The srangest thing was the government made annoucement that they were conducting an test an if we heard something ignore it. Several day turned to months then some start yelling at me and one day while I was sitting in my chair  Iheard a strang sharp noise so loud that it made my ears hurt that I had to leave my home an go out side. I went to the doctors an he refered me to the audiolegist and they informed me that I had tenitious. An then about four months or so the same sound happened agin this it last sometimes fours and for several days. I t seemed like every where I went somebody or some being was testing my ears until I cried out in pain and  I heard a voice that told who ever was! doing that insane test to stop because it was hurting his ears.I went back a gain to the audiologist this time the test showed a 5% hearing an now my tenitious was worsted than before. Then thing started happening in my home that never happened before; like items coming up missing and feeling like being wanted to look over my body naked. I felt buring temporary feeling on my throat while I sat in my chair doing my art. The bed moved in a wave like motion but I never saw who was in my room. I am a dibetic so one night I thought I was having a diabetic attack because I feel some leechs like suck ing on my kindey areas. I felt thing I never felt before on my back thight lie two snail like feeling but when I wipped my my leg because I I though something might have crawled on me because I slept on the floor but when I did that it went away an never came back. Because of the tentious that I have now every thinh is amplfied because the ears is damaged an now some of those voice I! hear now screems.But one night when I slept I happed to feel ! my mouth mve but when I looked up I was a light green being with maybe arms or tentagles sort floating above me; then I went back to sleep. Another time I was sleep  an I happened to awake an I saw a pink and blue want appeared to be  what we call a snail an I looked an rolled over an went back to sleep. An between that time some people were standing out side an I didn't think much about expect when I walked pasted someone standing there an he spoke but he did'nt open his mouth to speak and spoke back with my mouth as we do.  So many thing happen I didn't know what to think then something happen while I was sitting in my chair; I felt something crawl through my chair an I jumped up an something in now on my back especially every time I sit on any like right now. I went to the doctor an to see if he could see any thing but he could not; its not a pain it is ignoring to have something you can not see but on your back on the spinal cors, kidney, and tailbone. All of this has been happen! ing as this day of Sept.10,2012; from what I can understand some if not all hate by who ever the beings are especial African American why they don't say. One day I am living a normal not I am just living why did this only god know but I will stand up for all those who can not stand because as the united stated denies the excistance or extresstrail that is a ball faced lie for now I am also brought from the darkness to the light.

Was on a party boat with others out on Lake Union waiting for the fireworks to begin (and no drinking!).  Saw the first (and single) object moving slowly from north to south directly over our head.  At first thought it was a helicopter, but had an orange/red glow and no navigation lights and no sound.  Then thought it might be an airplane at high elevation catching the sun.  It moved south and then disappeared.  Thought it may have gone into the shadow of the earth. Perhaps 10 minutes later saw two similar lights/objects moving from south to north and far to the south.  Very close together it seemed; and too close to each other to be airplanes.  They disappeared as they moved to the north.

      "story": "Multiple glowing objects flying South down Puget Sound I live in West Seattle about 1/4 mile South of the Fauntleroy ferry dock. About 9:30PM last night two friends and I went up on my roof and sat in chairs facing West, giving us a sweeping view of Puget Sound, Vashon, Baimbridge and Blake islands and the Olympic mountains. It was twilight, and there were multiple fireworks going off both on our side of the Sound and across on the islands. Suddenly all three of us noticed two bright reddish orange lights flying southward, in tandem, down the Sound. I would estimate that they were at 5,000 feet altitude, flying slightly faster than a jet, maintaining equal distance from one another, and completely silent.  They were about the size of a large jet, but were just glowing lights, with no visible structure.  As they flew over the North tip of Vashon Island, they both appeared to slow down, and the one that was slightly ahead began to dim.  They continued on their course until we could no longer see them (behind some trees in my yard).  We were amazed and were discussing what they possibly could have been when another light, this time solo, followed the exact same path down the sound. At this point, I ran down to grab some high powered binoculars, and within a few minutes another light followed in the same path as the prior three.  This time I was able to get a much closer look, focusing in on it with the binoculars.  It l ooked like a fireball, with a red glow behind it.  This one too slowed and dimmed but never fully faded.  Over the course of the next half hour, five more of these lights came down the sound.  We saw one jet, flying Northwesterly from Seatac airport, clearly make a large turn to avoid the passing light. I cannot stress enough that these lights were no part of the fireworks displays.  They were much higher in the sky, and we had a clear view of each one for at least 30 seconds as it flew from North to South.  Even though the main firework event was going on 10 miles North of us over Lake Union in Seattle, Im sure there were thousands of people watching fireworks over Puget Sound and it would have been impossible to miss these lights traveling down the sound. I thought there would be a story about it on the news this morning, but I didnt hear a word about it.",

The first time we saw it was about 10 minutes after the fireworks display had ended.  There were still people launching fireworks from houses nearby but this was not any kind of firework.  We were outside on a friends deck when I noticed a glowing flickering orb parallel to our position at a 45 degree angle. The object appeared to be about a 1/2 mile away at the time moving maybe 5-10mph and appeared to hover at altitude twice as it moved south.  I pointed it out to several friends and they all witnessed it too.  The object as best as I can describe was round, glowing and flickering almost fire like and as far as we could tell silent.  At its closest point to us there was a second smaller object very dim following slightly behind it and off to one side.  It was hard to judge ! the distance of the second object to the first although it did cross it's path more than once.  This area of downtown Seattle is in the flight path for the airport so there are planes in the sky constantly.  Along the flight path of the object a plane did cross a couple of miles behind and above it.  My point is that we're all familiar with the lights on the aircraft flying around the sky most evenings and this had a much warmer non blinking glow and was traveling much to slowly for a commercial airliner or private plane.  After about 5 minutes it had traveled pretty far south and we lost sight of it.  The second sighting was about 20 minutes later waiting in traffic on Dexter Ave.  The object appeared east of the previous location on the other side of the lake.  This time it shot up from behind a large hill at about a 45 degree angle then leveled off at what appeared to be the same altitude as before and headed slowly north until it was out of our sight.  This sighting lasted abou! t 2 minutes no second object was seen.  Somebody asked me if I ! thought it was a lantern.  I don't think so, as it appeared to be under powered flight and moving in a controlled manner. It also appeared far too large for a lantern. There was no significant breeze at the time and without power not sure how it would have later showed up moving in the opposite direction. There is a video posted on Youtube this morning along with comments from other witnesses in the area. The video is NOT mine an is not very well shot, it also does not get across the warmth and orange hue of the object as we saw it.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T0JM1SFszE   I'm not suggesting this was E.T. :) but it was most certainly an unidentified flying object.",

My location was on Queen Anne, near Fremont Bridge facing east over Lake Union, Lake Washington and the Cascades.  Clear night, moon was approx 20deg up from horizon (google sky map &quot;time travel&quot; feature could give more accurate detail).  Was about to mount my motorcycle, stopped, took helmet off and stood in driveway.  First sighting was a fairly bright orange/somewhat red light passing visually just below the moon heading south.  I tried to rationalize the sight, looking for a 'tail' of a comet, asteroid, blinking strobes of an airplane.  Nothing made sense, no modulation of light, no strobes, no other color lights and it was nearly as bright and big as the red 'strobes' on the I5 bridge.  Speed was about a palm width every two seconds.. also strangely fast.  As soon as the light had traveled about 4 palm widths at arms length across the sky, another showed up on the same exact path, same speed, same brightness.  My view of where the lights had o! riginated from was obscured by a large apartment building across the street.   The original light continued on its path, followed by the other, quite a distance (maybe another four or five palm widths).  By this time, with the exact same spacing and speed, another light had appeared just left and below the moon.  There were three visible at this moment.   The original light became dim, flickered and within a palm width distance was gone.  I made a couple of phone calls, of which my neighbor answered and was walking down Dexter Ave and into the driveway at that moment.  He and I watched a remaining four or five, as a total of 8 lights traveled the same path, the same speed and with the same exact spacing across the sky, flickering and disappearing at the same exactly spot in the sky (except the last one).  The last light made a path, arcing visually 'higher' than the others and flickered out at the same timing/distance as the others.   I wish I could have seen it from my bal! cony, as I'm sure by the intensity of light, and how mathemati! cally sp aced and accurate they appeared, they would have created a chain of lights throughout the horizon.  I work in IT as a programmer, have been a military aircraft enthusiast since a very early age, and for whatever reason didn't think to use my phone for video.  To note:  There were other aircraft in the sky throughout the sighting, commercial airliners and a small prop plane.  I could hear the prop plane clearly, but nothing else out of the ordinary.  Every airplane in the sky had distinct red/green/white strobes, and were of 'normal' speed.  The flight path of commercial airliners normally fly west towards my apartment, then bank close enough that in most cases I can make out the branding/logo on the planes (in daylight).  After this sighting, throughout the night all of the commercial airliners were making their turns towards seatac much further away (east) than usual.",

      "story": "UFO seen crossing I-5 Ship Canal Bridge from East to West (shaped like a rowboat, iridescent orange, with a small blue light at front) A friend and I had just started driving Northbound on I-5, coming from Highway WA-520, and were in the middle of an argument, when we both stopped arguing: in front of us, over the freeway, was a UFO crossing the Interstate 5 Ship Canal Bridge from East to West, at maybe walking, jogging, or running speed (possibly 3-10MPH). It was mostly a glowing iridescent amber or orange color, emitting its own light, but also had a small, bright, dark-blue light at the front. It was shaped almost like a rowboat, but was about as big as a house (single-story, rambler size). I could see no wings, propellers, wheels, pontoons, doors, windows, rudder, or blimp-like parts to it. It did not look like any floatplane (common in the Lake Union area), regular airplane, glider, helicopter, balloon, or blimp that I had seen before.  If it were a blimp, it had no gondola or \"passenger car\" visible below it, and no visible tailfins; and at the top of the amber/orange light, it was straight across, not rounded at all. It was moving too slowly to be a plane.  (It would have fallen out of the sky.) And it was much too large to be a helicopter, and wasn't even close to the shape of any I've ever seen. Again, it was about as large as a small house. I knew very little about UFOs, and wasn't sure I even believed in them, but because I had heard that UFOs could quickly zip away, I tried to not even blink as we approached its path.  My friend was driving; so I unbuckled my seatbelt, and got up on my car seat so that I could quickly turn around, and keep my eye on it through her side windows; and I did this. It was close enough that I could have thrown a baseball, and hit it. As we passed it, I was not sure that I could still see it.  And as we kept on going past, I could no longer see anything there at all!  I said to her, \"It's gone!\" or something like that. I no longer saw any indication that it was still there. DETAILS:  It was at night, and dark.  At least the one lamp it was passing over was out (not lit). (Two or three of them might have been out.) Other freeway lamps were lit. I recall no rain.  So I believe it was dry. When I first saw it, we had just entered I-5 not many seconds before that; and only part of it had come over the bridge yet. It continued to move in the air, across the width of the bridge from East to West.  As we passed it, we were, I believe, in the far right lane; and the back end of it had just then crossed over the railing of the bridge, on the West. It had crossed over the bridge just a short distance before mid-span, and was maybe 20-40 feet above the lamp posts. The area where the amber or orange light was emitting (not reflecting), I would guess was between 6 and 10 feet high, but not more than 20 or 25 feet; and maybe between 50 and 80 feet long. The entire craft seemed lighted up by this light, except for the small blue light at front. Neither she nor I seem to recall the exact year or time of year, or the time of day. I am thinking that it was either in 1999 or 2000. I didn't report it then because I was afraid that we had seen something that we weren't \"supposed\" to see, something from the military or government, possibly. She didn't report it either. To date, she won't even discuss it with me!  I am reporting it now because, years later, I have found out that UFOs are far more common than I had then realized, and because whatever it was we saw moving slowly over the bridge was now more than 10 years ago, and now maybe the \"owner\" of it wouldn't really care since it's been so long, and because I just wanted to finally report it. I only wish I could recall the date and time. This event came as a total surprise to me, and was startling at the time, especially since it seemed to me that while the craft was visible from one angle, it was apparently non-visible from another; or else it became invisible to my eyes; or it moved so quickly (after moving so slowly) that I didn't even see it jump away. I didn't take my eyes off of it, or blink (at all, or very little); I just couldn't see it anymore, even though we were still pretty close to where I had last seen it, a little more than maybe 7 lanes away. It was in our view for maybe 20-30 seconds. MISC: I think the height of the bridge is over 180' above the water or streets below. A Wikipedia article says it's about 119 feet wide. We were going too fast to know whether or not it was making any sound (probably between 55 and 65MPH). The lights on it were steady, and none were blinking. There were no red or white lights on it, from our angle. CONJECTURE AND/OR IMPRESSIONS:  I am not sure why, but I got an impression (or imagination) that there was much more to the airship than we were able to see; but we were so close to it that it seems unlikely that I would have missed seeing more of the craft. It seems unlikely to me that the rest of it was hidden by the cover of night; though, after seeing some recent science articles, I suppose that it could have been hidden by current or advanced \"invisibility\" technology. I also had the impression that the craft we saw was visible from one angle, but not visible from another, vs. either it taking off so fast that I didn't even see it move or disappearing \"coincidentally\" right as we were passing its back end. \u00a92012.

At first glance they appeared to be street lights, but I knew right away that based on the location of the lights the source was absolutely something aerial as they were far too high in the air, and too far from any road to be street lights. I then saw another set of lights fly over Holman road, from north to south, as I pulled into the parking lot of the store. I immediately parked my car and got out to get a better look. At this time I realized that there were at least 10 of these lights, in no particular formation, flying southward into the night sky.  They did not appear to be ascending or descending. One of them hovered momentarily above me, long enough for me to attempt to get my phone out. Of course, my phone battery was completely drained of battery life.  Instead I gazed at this thing, taking mental notes of it\u2019s dark orange center that blended in a gradient to a dark red around the circumference.  It appeared to have some kind of texture on the orange portion that is hard to pinpoint or describe in a way that does it justice.... it almost looked like it was organic, for lack of a better term. Like the surface of the sun almost. It just appeared to have some kind of motion and energy to it. It was fuzzy, like I just couldn\u2019t quite make out fine details on it. At this point, a fellow witness drove up toward me in a late model camaro (or possibly trans-am / firebird / i-roc - early to mid 80\u2019s model in great condition) and stopped her car. She asked me excitedly if I could see them too. I informed her I could of course, and she got out of her car to watch them with me. She got out of her car just in time to see the last one disappear from site. It was not clear whether these myseterious lights faded out due to distance or due to their light source slowly being extinguished. The only thing I could compare these to would be Chinese lanterns, but that doesn\u2019t feel right.  They were, at least from my perspective, too large to be Chinese lanterns, and too perfectly round. Plus the lighting was so perfect....almost unreal.  It was so even over the surface of the sphere it almost looked matte.  The lights were not extremely bright, they were actually quite dull, as if they were just bright enough to illuminate the body of these objects. I can say they were definitely NOT fireworks of any kind, as they were visible far too long and moved way too slowly.  I can say they were not standard aircraft because they did not make any audible sound and did not have the standard FAA required lights flashing anywhere on them. That\u2019s it.  They disappeared and I\u2019m in awe.",

They appeared to be at 5000 feet or so and then they started elevating from there to the north of Magnolia. It was difficult to judge the exact elevation they were however.  It appeared to be about the same height that a low plane would be. When I first noticed them, at first I thought they were just the blinking red lights on the radio towers on the top of Queen Anne Hill as they were at about that height in the sky. I then looked to my east and observed the Queen Anne blinking red radio tower lights and quickly realized that these reddish/orange fireball orbs were something totally different than the Queen Anne radio tower lights as they were to the north and there are no radio towers to the north of my location on Magnolia. These orbs were different as they were not blinking and were a solid reddish/orange color and they were moving. I observed these orbs for approximately 10 mins as they slowly came north from the south and slowly elevated from their original elevation keeping in formation. One orb after the other elevated (one at a time)to a certain elevation point in the sky maybe 10,000 feet closer to my location than at first. When each one got to the same higher elevation point in the sky each one of them disappeared at about the same point in the sky (one by one) until they had all disappeared by 11:50 PM PST. They made ! no sound. Normally in Magnolia there is lots of plane air traf! fic that I observe from this vantage point of planes taking off and landing as they fly over the city of Seattle in approach for landing or after takeoff from SeaTac Airport to the south as this location I was at in Magnolia is right over the flight path to the SeaTac airport from the north. I made a point to look around in every direction while I was viewing the orbs looking for air traffic and there were no planes that I observed during this 10 minute sighting while the orbs were present. This was very strange as it is very normal to hear and see planes flying over this location in Magnolia all the time. I noticed that no sooner as soon as the last orb had disappeared above me that I saw and heard several airplanes fly over the area as was normal. It was as if the orbs saw the planes coming and disappeared just before they arrived.  I am a 43 year old Regional Manager for a HR Software Company. I have had three jobs in 20 years out of college. My mother has lived in Magnolia for 20 years and I stay with her frequently and no the area well and the air traffic patterns of planes in the area. These orbs were not planes or helicopters as they were solid lights, moved slow in a formation, and were totally silent. They were not flares either because flares come down and these orbs were going up and keeping in formation. I have never seen anything like them before.",

It had been raining for four days straight when suddenly there was a break in the clouds.  I decided to go outside on my balcony to enjoy the stars, since I miss the New Mexico night skies, and also smoke a cigarette.   As I was looking at the stars, I noticed a circular light, a little bigger than the size of a star in the sky, moving in a straight line above me from the north heading south.  Out of the corner of my eye, I see another circular light, the same size as the first light, coming in from the right (west) perpendicular to the first light.  At first they weren\u2019t moving too fast but as the lights got closer to each other, the speed increased.  It appeared as though they were heading for a collision at this point.  I was sure they were going to hit and cause some sort of explosion but instead they began spinning around each other, making what looked like figure 8s.   This lasted only a few seconds before both light! s continued heading south parallel to each other(side by side). As the lights got further away, they began to slowly separate and disappeared into the clouds.",

      "story": "Multiple bright strobes in a circular pattern over Puget Sound near Mebane Point navigational bouy. September 8, 2012,  Performing a boat delivery five nautical miles north of Shilshole marina Seattle WA.  The time was approximately 2100.  I was traveling southbound at between 5 and 6 knots in a southerly breeze of 12 with a disturbed sea state.  Clear skies very little ambient light. I was distracted by a flashing strobe type light from astern (North) looked back and discounted it as air traffic.  About five minutes later took another look and lights were much closer and well defined.  The strobes were flashing from my right to left (east to west) in the front of the craft.  Continued to monitor the craft as it neared. As the craft passed over head I could determine that the flashes were distinct separate lights moving around the craft.   The lights were bright enough for me completely lose my night vision.  I could not make out any sound (please note that I was running a diesel engine at full throttle in building seas and breeze).  I would approximate the altitude around 2000 to 3000 ft.  Please note that I did not see any navigational lights or spots. The craft continued south, parallel to numerous commercial flights heading north prior to their east bound turn (out of Seatac).  It passed at least three jets heading north and if this was odd they could not have missed the lights.  I tracked the craft as it made an easterly turn over the shipping canal toward Lake Union.  At this point I thought it might have been a strange lighting configuration on a sea plane which would land on lake union.  Or a new lighting configuration on a plane heading for Boeing Field. My curiosity was piqued when the craft did not land in lake union or turn south to Boeing Field but instead turned north (probably over lake Washington) and continued that course until I lost it behind the rise (this is how I approximated the altitude)  I was about two miles off shore and to lose it behind the hill the angle would not allow for much height. Strange occurrence and thought if you got other reports this might help to substantiate them.  Times and heights are all approximated so use with a grain of salt.  But I hit the Shilshole dock at 2200 so speed and time are pretty close.",

      "story": "Bright object in sky fades away over Seattle I was traveling northbound on I5 (http://goo.gl/maps/PH2Za) while riding my motorcycle.  Having a helmet view of the sky I could see everything very clearly. It was bright and mostly clear. There were a few distant cirrus clouds but when I saw this object it was back-dropped by clear blue sky. The object was flat and bright and moving easterly and  at an approximate 4 or 5 degrees angle upward. The brightness of the object could have been sunlight gleaming from it but it was much brighter than one would normally expect even having sunlight bounce off of it. There was a gleam about the object that appeared to move on the object.  At first I thought that the object was a jet since this location is near Boeing, and to be honest, it could have been, I guess.  It was probably four or five miles from me, I estimate, and it was about an half-inch wide from my perspective. After watching this object for around 10 seconds the background of the object changed so that th! ere was a very distant and slightly transparent, small cirrus cloud.  As the object approached the location in the sky where the background became the cloud, the object could be seen completely until the last part of the object was forefronted to the cloud at which point the object slowly faded away.   By the time I saw the fading occur, I will admit that I was in a slight turn on the freeway which put me in a more north east direction. I continued to watch the location of the sky where the object existed. After a few seconds, I ended up in a more sharp curve putting me in a north direction of travel again while still maintaining as close an eye to that part of the sky without getting in an accident but that object never reappeared *anywhere* in the sky. The cloud in the back ground was small so any flying object would have left that area of the sky back into clear blue sky within seconds. This object did not and I was never able to see the object again after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "Lone Fireball flew over my apartment, zig-zagged, changed colors, flew off(?) For the second time now since July 7th, I have had another sighting of one of these things.  Last time I saw upwards of a dozen of these things fly over a grocery store. Last night/early this AM my girlfriend and I were standing on our balcony at 2am, gazing up at the night sky. We'd seen a shooting star (no question in my mind) moments before this and a jet was creeping by off in the distance (no doubt again - could hear it and familiar with the light patterns on airliners).  Then, we saw one of these fireballs. I saw it first and gasped. Pointed up at the sky, said &quot;HONEY LOOK HOLY S* THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I SAW!&quot; She watched it as I ran inside to grab something with a camera on it. It had come from behind us, flying over the top of our building at what appeared to be a relatively low altitude.  I started to capture video the best I could on my iPod touch...which isn't much obviously. Not a great video but I wanted to document it SOMEHOW for my! self mainly. Here's the strange thing....before I had a very difficult time describing just how odd this thing looked. This time I paid attention to every detail knowing that is what NUFORC needs. Luckily, on this occasion the thing made very erratic movements after coming in a north to south direction over our apartment complex. It did a sort of subtle zig-zag movement a few times, then glided into a change of direction to the left (East) in a motion that can only be described as perfectly organic. Ballerina like, very graceful and smooth.  At times it seemed to produce a bit of a red trail. It did change color dramatically unlike the last ones I saw. This time it started out BRIGHT yellow, almost white, faded to a blood red, then back to near white again. No real pattern to the changes that I could discern. Luckily my crappy video does at least show evidence of this to some degree, though not to the same degree as to the naked eye. OK here's the really strange thing... It had this..vibration to it. I don't mean that in some spiritual way or metaphysical pseudo-scientific sense....Imagine the way a guitar string looks when it's plucked. Sitting motionless, you can see a guitar string perfectly without interference or distortion. Now if you *pluck* a guitar string, causing it to vibrate and  produce sound, you can still see it. It still maintains it's same general shape (a metallic line in the string's case) but it is moving so rapidly that it appears distorted. It gets blurry, sort of elongated at times, or wider at others, but in the center where it normally rests you can still see a basic ghost of it's shape and details.... It's definitely there, but your eyes can't keep up with it. That's what this thing appeared like. It was definitely round, but there was this weird fuzziness to it that was not caused by distance or lack of efficient eyesight. There was some kind of....other wordly or at least odd and very rapid motion to this thing....that's what I mean when I say it was &quot;vibrating&quot;. Anyway, it went left, going behind a tree, where I could still see it a bit with my naked eyes.  It sat there for a good minute at least, and eventually just was not there when I looked up again. Definitely not a chinese lantern. I actually had set one off into the night after the experience I had on the 7th of July just to try to see if it in fact was what I had seen. I can unequivocally state it was not a chinese lantern. I at some point felt electric, the way you do before a lightning storm. I checked the weather report for today on the NOAA site, and at that time it looks like the wind was blowing in a Northern direction at about 5mph, max of 8.....but north is the exact opposite direction this thing was going. I may upload the video but am hesitant to. It is not good quality, and on top of that I am audibly shaken up by what I'm seeing and sound like a scared little girl or something so it's kind of embarrassing. ALTHOUGH.....I am a video professional by trade so in an attempt to clean up the crap video a bit and enhance it to get a better look at this thing..... I found something positively EERIE. Right before I stopped taping,  something that appears to be a &quot;gray alien&quot; face takes over the left side of the frame.  Note this only happens when I process the video to increase contrast and boost GAIN levels, which can cause distortion if done inappropriately.   In my opinion I don't think if grays exist, they have anything to do with fireballs or really care to associate with us, but it is definitely maybe worth noting.",

I did not think too much of them because of the air traffic we have in my neighborhood and the fact that we see helicopters in the air at that altitude all the time.  My first thought was that those helicopters lights are really bright.   As they flew over my head they started \u201corbing\u201d (best way to describe it)this vibrant Orange which startled me. Immediately I ran to grab my camera.  By the time I got back outside to capture the phenomenon they were already in the distance passing over downtown Seattle in a pyramid formation.

It looked as if they were jumping in and out of dimensions, in the same location at first but then in different locations.  They commenced to return to the same area they had just disappeared from.  When they reappear they clearly displayed some sort of controlled Aerial Synchronicity.  There were three other people walking up the hill oblivious to what was going on above them.  It wasn\u2019t until I pointed it out that they noticed. The airport is just down the way...I\u2019ve been living here in this neighborhood long enough to know the air traffic where I live and I am conscious enough to know what is ours and what is  not.  To my knowledge, none of our air craft's disappear then reappears in different areas of the sky nor do they jump in and out of the atmosphere as if they have the ability to open star gates into inner space. In any case, I have the phenomenon on tape, if only I had my camera the whole time I would have capture them at a lower altitude doing their \u201corbing\u201d thing\u2026bottom line, man made air craft, do not jump in and out of the atmosphere and relocate in a different area in the sky in an instant.",

      "story": "lights started appearing out of nowhere. I was on patrol last night at my job in downtown Seattle, and just doing a routine rove around my building when strangely enough something caught my eye in the sky. As i looked up into the night shy for about 5 to ten minutes a bright flash appeared dead center in the sky witch kinda freaked me out, I have always believed in UFO's I have just never witness it in person until last night.  So i remained glued to the clear night sky and as soon as my eye's started to focus in on the stars there it was (first one) a faint redish yellow object appeared it had to be 80 or 90 thousand feet in the air way higher than any airplane I've seen before but it was traveling pretty fast no sound was heard and slowly vanished. At this point i was kinda freaked out but excited that i saw this. 5 minutes later as i continued to look around in the sky another (second one) this one was kinda scary as it was very close could of been approx 4 - 500 feet from where i was standing it was really bight, the color of light was a hyper white blue amber color and was descending to the street level really quick. Again there was no sound coming from it and out of nowhere it suddenly vanished behind the building that was about 2 blocks from our building.  At this point I hope someone else witnessed that too as i couldn't of been the only one that saw this. Almost instantly after witnessing that I was about to head back inside my building and saw what i still cant figure out what to actually call it (third one?.) Three green blips of light occurred right above that where I saw the bright light descend down behind the building. Kind of like a connect the dots type of motion is the best way to describe the event - Fist one flashed top, bottom left, then bottom right. Like i said before I have never witnessed anything this strange ever while working here in my 10 years, last night was definitely an eye opener. I will have my camera with me from this point forth.",

      "story": "I saw about 8-9 red-orange lights hover over the Eastside of Seattle and change formations from triangles and lines before disappearing UFO Sighting Friday June 29, 2012 at 22:33-22:37 Seattle, WA \u2013 Looking to the East from Lake Union towards Lake Washington/ Bellevue/Kirkland area  Ok, so I was standing with a friend on their balcony overlooking  Lake Union to the East with a 180\u00b0 view of Seattle from southern University of Washington campus to the North East of downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill. It was about 22:33pm on Friday June 29,2012 and while we were talking I was looking at the view and I looked at my friend (who had his back to the view in the east) for about 4sec, when I looked back up behind him I had seen that three red/orange lights (about twice the size and brightness of the star cluster of Sirius on a clear winter night) were sitting in a large equilateral triangular formation over (what looked like from northern Capitol Hill to the junction of I-5 and SR-520 East). As we watched (which the whole duration of the event was over a period of approximately 4min) the triangle started to move slowly to the north an upwards (from my perspective it would be approximately 1mph). As the triangle formation of red/orange lights moved, another light ! of the same color (red/orange), size, and brightness appeared about 450meters up and 300 meters to the north of the triangle appeared. Then the light began to slowly move north at around 5mph (from my perspective) and a greater speed to the east towards Kirkland before slowly fading out. As this occurred, four lights of the same original intensity and color as the initial triangle (which at this point was still in formation) of lights began to appear from behind Capitol Hill to the east and appeared in a straight line, one after, another (and these moved up quickly (from my perspective 10-15mph)  before slowing to a stop) in a perfectly straight line (which would bisect the lower southern corner of the triangular formations roughly 45\u00b0 angle if drawn through the four new lights, connecting to the bottom , southern corner light, and through the equilateral triangle itself). As the four new lights were appearing, the triangular formation began to form into a line perpendicular with the horizon. What was the top light of the triangle began to move into the original spot of the light which hovered about the fir! st triangular formation before disappearing. This light then moved in the same direction and speed as the light before it had before slowly disappearing in the north, but mainly east (east towards Houghton and as far north as the University of Washington campus). The new four lights that had come up in a line to the bottom, southern corner of the triangular formation began to move upwards at approximately (from my perspective about 5mph). As these lights moved upwards, the top ones would take the spot of the others before it and would hover in a single spot before moving slightly north to the east and slowly fade away. The last four lights had moved upwards and the first four had pretty much disappeared in the distance by now (It was about 22:36) when the first of the four new lights moved into the upper position to the north east. The three lights below it then went into a small equilateral triangle formation (within approximately less than 100meters of each other). These three lights then moved into another formation forming a perpendicular line with the horizon before gradually moving up and to the north east before fading away. I feel crazy writing this, I believe in UFOs but my friend doesn\u2019t but neither of us is sure what we saw. We watch airplanes (both commercial and military) helicopters come in for landing and move across the city skyline every night but never have we seen anything like this. The lights did not blink like airplane lights would and they were more orange than red. But they weren\u2019t to be mistaken with airplane headlights either. Airplane headlights are a white/yellow light and accompanied with the green, red, and white wing and taillights. I have never seen any aircrafts fly like this and make these formations and possess these lights. Airplanes which are able to hover in the way which these lights/possible crafts did are extremely loud and can be heard from miles away. There was no sound accompanying these lights in the sky. I know what I saw, I can\u2019t explain what it was but I don\u2019t think it was normal. I hope my descriptions of my sighting can be understood and can help. By th! e time we really believed that this was for sure an unusual sighting and set up the camera to take a photo, the lights had faded too much in order to get a quality photo of them. I called the National Weather Service here in Seattle and they reported that the winds were coming in from the south at the time and area of the sighting.",

      "story": "A yellow orange shield shaped object about 3 to 4ft tall with a flame inside traveling in a S/SE direction at treeline. On Sunday July 1, 2012 in King county just outside the city limits of Seattle, Washington, at approximately 10:50 pm, my husband glanced out of the front window and made an unusually strong exclamation \"what is that\" so I immediately turned around to look out the window as well.   We have large picture windows which join at the NE corner of the house in our living room and we were each seated on either side of the end table with lamp situated in the corner of the window.  I saw a large glowing yellow/orange kind of shield shaped object with a flame in the middle moving fairly swiftly and smoothly at tree level I jumped up to move quickly to the windows on the side of the house and and back patio windows to watch the object move past the side of our house toward Renton, which borders the west side and back of our property.   It continued to move evenly seeming self propelled until it was behind a tree in the back SE corner of our property and I could see it glowi! ng through the branches until it was gone from my sight.  I almost thought it had slowed, but I believe it was probably traveling a little more easterly away from us. I had never seen anything like this before and was surprised at the size and how close to us it was traveling. I was most fearful of the flame in the middle if it were to be caught in the trees or even land and start a fire.  I told my husband that the only thing I could even imagine was like a hot air balloon, but there was no balloon you could see and it was not that large.  I have never seen a hot air balloon in this area and that time of night, the size and close proximity to the houses and trees made no sense. It looked to be maybe 3 to 4 feet tall give or take and I would estimate the angle when I point to where I first saw the object to where it disappeared to be about 165 degrees and the sighting lasted maybe 30 to 45 seconds.  The front of our home faces north possibly slightly northwest and the object was traveling from the north heading toward our home heading south probably slightly more southeast. We had a call that night that my brother-in-law had just taken his wife to the hospital emergency room on Sunday night at 10:36 pm,  so that was certainly weighting on our minds until we knew she would recover and then I began to think more about reporting what we saw shortly after the call so that it might be helpful in someway.  Hopefully I have given useful information. I wonder if this could have been some kind of lantern launched inappropriately?

I stopped my car facing west in the middle of the street.  Opened the door my body facing and looking directly south because I saw an orange spherical object brightly lit from the center spinning horizontally in the clear night sky.   Where I stood, I saw three more objects @ a further distance from me directly to my east was the Seattle space needle in the clear night sky.  The other three lit spheres were hanging there in the skyline two to the north of the needle one to the south all positioned without movement in a offset triangle.  The spherical orb coming from southeast traveling west to meet the other three.   On this night the moon was very full and close.  The moon  directly to my east still and about level with my ear and very large, basketball size.  The orange sphere which flew over me was at least the size of a baseball, to my sight and perception it seemed to be flying low.  Straight, horizontal and @ a moderate speed spanning the city in a minute or so to reach its destination.   There were aircraft, planes in the distance, tiny specks in comparison also helicopters dropped in on the far three aggressively and with there bright lights just before the orbs of light disappeared.  The sphere which I saw most closely seemed to be revolving as it passed.  There was an energy similar to fire coming from the very center and shining so brightly that it lit the otherwise planet looking object.   It did not seem to move like anything made by man. it was silent.  It was beautiful.  It seemed to be made of a rock matter like the moon looks, only a bright energy beamed from the center, a nucleus which propelled it.  I contacted my best friend by phone and she was in south lake union.  I alerted her to it and she and another got out of the car looked up in time to catch the same experience as my self.   I am a thirty five year old, esthetician and business owner born and raised in this city.  I have never seen or experienced anything I can relate to as similar to this event. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness on several occasions, and she seemed to us to be quite eloquent and credible.  We suspect that she is a very good witness.  We await other reports from the other witnesses, who we were told also saw the orbs.  PD))",

When we attempted to photograph the sphere, our cameras would not focus on the object, thus a black blur is all that is observable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "At 11:00 pm I was with a group at an outdoor cinema on Capitol Hill.  I noticed three reddish orange orbs of light moving south from over lake Washington towards Renton.  What was strange is that they all had one pulsating light and it was large and slightly diffused.  Over the course of the evening I had noticed numerous typical plane and helicopter lights passing over downtown.  They all had a series of different fine pinpoint colored lights flashing such as red with flashing white, green etc. The three lights silently passed by and headed south. Strangely there were not fading lower into the horizon, as you would expect. Other aircraft with blinking green/white lights was following the horizon and fading into the lower atmosphere. These crafts were flying a direct line of site from their current altitude to about 40-50 degrees into the sky. This means they were not flying in parallel to the ground but descending up. I quickly pointed this out to the group I was with and they immediately noticed they were not typical aircraft.  At that point they began to quickly disappear into the sky as if they were leaving the atmosphere.    About a minute later three more red/orange orbs appeared on almost the same path. Their characteristics were similar but the third light seemed to quickly speed up before vanishing. The weather that night was crystal clear. The moon was out stars were visible. There were no smoke or vapor trails behind the lights. They moved way to fast to be flairs. They were not moving into the horizon like a typical craft but were disappearing into the upper atmosphere. They did not have a series of flashing lights but a slightly pulsating light with a reddish orange glow. This was definitely not like any craft I have seen before. The details were very similar to other events posted here as recently as June and July 2013.",

      "story": "Two large, brightly lit oval disks seen from West Seattle South over Puget Sound On the evening of July 22nd I was on the deck of our home in West Seattle and my husband was upstairs.  Our home sits facing south on the cliff above Puget Sound at an elevation of 328 feet.  It was 8:50 PM and the sun was setting. I looked out across Puget Sound to the south past Lincoln Park toward Tacoma and saw two large, hovering, rotating, oval-shaped crafts with very bright white lights that were flashing and twinkling. They were in formation and the one to the right looked to be further away.  From my vantage point, they were about \u00be the size of a full moon or larger.  Standing in the exact location if I extend my first finger the objects were as wide as my nail and \u00bd  to \u00be of the length of the nail.  Based on the altitude and the jet planes I see daily on the flight path I estimated that 3-4 large passenger jets could have fit inside. The lights were significantly brighter than the West Seattle-Vashon ferry which was traversing below (east to west) as well as the lights on the jet plane that was traveling south on the flight path (to the southwest) and the red aviation towers that are visible to the southwest of our house.  They looked like light reflecting off a diamond on a much larger scale. The location was just to the right (west and south) of Lincoln Park from my view and just above the land on the horizon. I could hear the jet and the disks/ ovals were noiselessly hovering and rotating slowly. I quickly got my binoculars and observed a dark black outline of the oval disks.  There were no wings, no propellers, and no landing gear with very bright light radiating from the center. I watched them for 3-5 minutes at which point the one to the right began to tip and turn to the left slowly like it was going to leave.  I could see the dark underside which was oval shaped.  As it turned, the bright light faced to the southeast but I couldn\u2019t see the other side of it, just the underside which appeared black. I went upstairs and handed the binoculars to my husband who then watched them for 3-5 minutes.  He attempted a picture through the binoculars with his iPhone but the resolution was not good enough.  Each disk slowly tipped to the right and departed to the southwest, slowly disappearing from sight.  As they turned the lights shone the other direction and the disks appeared black. I\u2019ve lived and worked as an acupuncturist in Puget Sound for 17 years and have never seen anything like this. I have sat on my deck or near our many south facing windows for the last 2.5 years and am familiar with all the Sea-Tac airport traffic, military planes and helicopters, have seen meteors and comets, but I have never seen anything like this.  The aircraft technology was more advanced than I have ever witnessed.",

I was facing south, with a great view of Downtown and the Space Needle.   At 10:34 I saw 7 or 8 bright orange orbs float upward from left to right seemingly from Capitol Hill or First Hill.  They continued to float/fly up behind the Space Needle heading from east to west. Some seemed to head south, and some seemed to head north before disappearing into the clouds. They appeared to move as fast as a small airplane or helicopter.  Seeing them fly across the sky and disappear into the clouds took about 3 or 4 minutes. 3 or 4 of these orange orbs were brighter than the rest.  They had a soft flickering quality.  They also appeared at first to be in a cluster, and then flew away from each other in a more perpendicular line while flying upwards.  Although the line was by no means perfectly straight. I sent a friend a text to ask if he had seen the bright orange orbs flying past the Space Needle.  He said no. At 10:54 pm another orange orb popped out of the sky over Capitol Hill or First Hill and flew upwards from left to right.  I told my friend to look out his window at, what I called, the loner orb.  He saw it and we watched it for about 5 minutes.  This one flew up west and north.  Finally, another lone orb appeared at 11:39 following the same flight pattern as the orb before it. After that I went home.  I have wondered why there haven\u2019t been more reports of this sighting.  It was a beautiful Saturday night.  I know there must have been people at Kerry Park that night seeing the same thing I saw.  Please report what you saw!",

I stood facing east toward Bellevue, looking at the blinking lights of the transmitter towers at the top of the hill.  We had a brief electrical storm earlier so the sky was just a big cloudy haze.   Suddenly, I see something in my peripheral to the right of the tower, a dim amber colored glow moving through the haze of the clouds.  My first thought was that it was the glow from airplane lights reflecting off the haze.  But now that I was looking at it directly I could see why it couldn't possibly be an airplane.  The flight pattern was too erratic.   I couldn't see what the glow was emanating from but whatever it was was zipping through the clouds at unearthly speeds and darting around like a hummingbird.  The glow also seemed to be too dim for plane lights.   It moved from the right of the towers to the left in about ten seconds which would be a considerable distance for a plane to travel in that small of a period of time.  Then it quickly faded out like it turned itself off.  I watched for another two minutes or so.   Called my buddy downstairs on my cel and told him what I saw.  He said he was coming up for a look himself.  While I waited for him I kept watching the sky.   About a minute after that the glow comes moving through the clouds in it's rapid darting fashion but this time it's coming from behind me, from the west moving east.  I quickly call my friend demanding he get up there.  I saw it again!  Get up here! I said.   We watched the skies for another 15 min or so but other than a few, what I presume, were lightning flashes off to the distance in the east, the glow didn't return.",

We arrived around 6. We sat down at the beach and drank coffee and tea and were talking about boats as we were looking around.  I was the first to notice what we saw. I could see the Seattle center area and space needle and that above it there were many white or off white things flying around. The things flew irregularly, they took sharp turns, while gaining altitude. Sometimes they would briefly remain still, but I couldn't tell if it was because they were moving towards/away from me, or remaining in place.  The objects would disappear frequently too, every 10-25 seconds.  Couldn't tell if it was because of clouds. My girlfriend could also see all of this.  First thing my roommate said to me when I woke up came to mind. &quot;Its windy today&quot; he said so I thought and told my girlfriend, \"They must be birds caught in the wind.\"  At the beach many birds were flying.  I could see some birds more on our side of the water, flying.  The birds were just about the same size as the more distant objects, all the way across the water by the science center/key arena area, in relation to my location at alkai.  Not sure if there were any events going on, I tried to find some online with my phone but found nothing. All the time about 15 minutes pass, after my eyes begin to become tired I decide to stop looking for only about a minute as my girlfriend and I continued to talk.  Roughly a minute later we both look back to search for another few minutes but don't see the objects anymore. We left the beach 10 minutes afterwards and went home. I've looked online and found no reports so far.   My girlfriend is 20 years old, she was born out of the country and has lived in Seattle a year now and currently works at the airport she came in from.

We saw what appeared to be a small object with red and green lights.  They were very bright and similar to LEDs based on past observations I have made of these types of light sources.  The lights appeared to be arranged in a tight square, two green and two red. Craft came up over the trees and hovered.  After approximately 5 seconds, it started accelerating to the NW until it was no longer viewable, due to the heights of nearby trees.  Our viewable horizon in that direction is approximately 60 degrees and above, essentially a circle of trees. It was clear to all viewing that this was not an airplane, satellite, or helicopter as there was no audible propulsion sound. Night was dead still with no wind.  We see air traffic daily as we are on the flight path for Boeing field (E to W, W to E) personal/private craft and are quite familiar with the sound and sights of such vehicles. The movement of the object definitely appeared to be \u201ccontrolled\u201d somehow.  Because of the low light it was impossible to judge size or distance but I would guess it was flying above Barton Ave, or the Fauntlee Hills neighborhood.  Holding one\u2019s thumb out at arm\u2019s length would have obscured it from view. Our guess was it was some sort of a remote controlled quad copter.  But it did have bright lights and was at a high altitude, 500\u2019 at least.  I am aware that Li-ON power packs are able to illuminate LED light strips and have a friend who does so with radio controlled planes that he flies in North Bend, WA. We saw one satellite that night and it took the predictable E to W path in a straight line.  It definitely was not the same type of object. About one hour later we saw an extremely bright meteor.  It entered atmosphere directly above us and burned up in bright white light heading due south towards Burien/Tacoma.  It actually left a contrail which I have never seen before in person.

Looking toward the West, I saw a Dark RED light descending.  Even though it was The Fourth of July and Lights what , Flashes, where all over the place.  The light disappeared for about 5 Minutes, It began ascending slowly in the same part of the Sky,  The light either would go out from time to time because it appeared to disappear and reappear.  I would have chocked it up to Fireworks except that it flew right over me.   The only thing I could see was the Red Light and no sound.  The first thought I had was this could be Surveillance Drone as I am trying to pay attention to events around me.

The objects were near the big deeper, north from our house in North Magnolia (Our house has a deck with views of an inlet to the Locks on the east and Puget Sound on the North.  The sighting was towards the north, towards Puget Sound.  When ((male name deleted)) started seeing the objects, they were almost still, they just moved a little towards the east.  They were flickering and then the lights turned off and then they reappeared.  I saw one very bright orange red object sparkling with rays, but it seemed to me it looked like an almost triangular shape.  I saw it more towards the east of the big deeper, first flashing behind a huge pine tree, then it moved west and I could see the object better.

Number of Objects: 1 Color: unlit   On July 18, 2013, in northeast Seattle, Washington, at 10:45 P.M., I observed an unlit rectangular wing flying over my condo.   At first I thought it was a meteor due to its very high speed.   The rectangle travelled in a southeast direction, disappearing over tree tops in approximately five seconds.  The rectangle was very large given its elevation, measuring approximately 3 inches.  Later that evening a Boeing 747 Dreamlifter flew across the same space.  Its elevation was much lower than the rectangle.  I measured the 747 at one-half inch, the diameter of the Moon.  The rectangle covered the same distance as the 747 in a fraction of the time as the latter. I could not detect any sound from the rectangle.  Even though unlit it was observable against the clear night sky, possibly reflecting city lights off its bottom surface.   I believe the rectangle was flying at least 3 times higher from me than the 747.

UFO sighting 2/15/13 Seattle, WA   At about 8:15 in the evening, my wife stepped outside onto our deck in Seattle to take a closer look at some orb shaped lights that she was watching in the direction of NE.  I saw her outside and asked what she was looking at.  She explained that she wanted to hear what these aircraft sounded like.   I joined her outside on the deck to check it out.  We were unable to hear any sound like jets or helicopters.   We see a lot of aircraft from our house, which overlooks Greenlake as a lot of air traffic comes in from the north when the south wind prevails.  The breeze we had this night was from the north.  The sky was clear for the first time in days and we were able to see a series of orange orb - like lights that seemed to come up from the NE horizon, maintain speed as if it was an aircraft and head south while gaining altitude.  We could see 2 or 3 at a time.  They did not blink or flash like aircraft usually do.   As they got about due east, they would fade out and new ones would appear coming from the same direction.   I ran upstairs, got my little camera and took a few photos and a little bit of video while we watched for approx. 10 minutes.   At one point, we could see a small aircraft with its flashing lights that appeared to be much closer to us than the \"orbs\" heading south.  We probably saw 15-20 lights in all. It would be very difficult to tell the distance \u2013 but we both figured at least about 5 miles away \u2013 but it\u2019s only a guess. After the sighting, I turned on the news, thinking I\u2019d see some explanation, but nothing was reported.  Checked the net first thing this a.m.; nothing there. We have a clear view of  Greenlake and the Cascade mountains from our deck , kitchen and upstairs and had even commented earlier in the day how clear the view was. Also, we\u2019ve lived in this house for about 30 years, seen a lot of aircraft \u2013 but this was different.",

About a day later (I think) the news reported a \"blue haze\" in New Zealand.  A few days later, the U.S. sends a rescue team to Antarctica to rescue a cancer victim at the South Pole, \"the middle of there winter\".  I think Nancy Reagan  \"a asrologer\" had Ronald build Star Wars.  I think they blew it up, and it landed in Antarctica, leaving a blue haze in New Zealand.  I know this was a while ago, but on George Noorys show, you said to report old stuff too.",

      "story": "Orange spheres/orbs over Seattle At approximately 8:40 PM on 12/24/13 returning to Bellevue from dinner my wife and I, with two children in the car, observed four very bright orange lights in a diamond shape over Seattle near the Space Needle.  We instantly we shocked as they were not commercial aircraft and flew in a coordinated manner and shifted to a rectangle, and then an oval.  If I had to guess they were 500 meters in diameter.  It seemed like there was a shape or form within the lights but it was impossible to tell for sure.  They traveled south of the city and at about where Boeing Field is they ascended vertically through the low cloud layer and vanished.  During the ascent we saw a commercial airliner fly under the lights.  We observed them for about 3 minutes, and during this our neighbors, also returning from a dinner, pulled up and saw the same (their oldest child was terrified, as was mine). During this a 5th orange light appeared from the same area and followed an identical flight pattern and vanished.  Attached is video I took for about 30 seconds when my wife told me to grab my phone.  I was excited and should have spent more time taping.  During the episode the entire sky appeared to briefly flash white, which is on video.  About 10 minutes afterwards I was still watching the sky and believe I saw a fighter jet fly over the city.  A work colleague I told the story to says they heard a fighter jet fly over their Bellevue home.  My neighbor who also witnessed the event says he was traveling north from the Federal Way area and had seen a number of military helicopters flying in the area.  What we saw were not helicopters.",

Just a few minutes prior to our city fireworks display was to begin over Lake Union, northeast of the Space Needle I noticed an unusual reddish changing to orange light that was far brighter than the usual aircraft in the sky.  I could also see that it was hovering. I zoomed in with my binoculars and I could see three lights - red, yellow and orange. The lights were flashing from right to left.  They also had a luminescence not typical for the usual aircraft I might see in the sky.  I had seen several helicopters overhead so I suspected I could be mistaking this hovering craft.  Once zoomed in through my binoculars it did not look like a helicopter.  I could see the outline of the helicopters when zoomed in on them. I was not able to see any detail aside from the lights on this craft.  I ran to grab my camera and zoomed in to capture it as the light turned southward and vanished instantly. The following morning my thirteen year old son returned home from spending the night with friends and wanted to show me some unusual photos he had taken while situated to watch the fireworks. He had been on the west side of the city, on top of a hillside looking down toward the lake, and had a straight on view of these strange lights in the sky. From his vantage point there were three of these bright lights forming a triangle shape, without any lines or visible material in between these lights. He snapped two very clear photographs of the lights. He noticed they moved formation, not remaining in this triangle shape before they all disappeared. I posted these photos to my Facebook page on July 5th. The only comment made in response was from his Aunt who was at yet another part of the city, closer down toward the lake from where he and I both were during this time. She had also seen these lights and suspected they were of UFO nature. (I have seen on one other UFO reporting sight as of today, July 6th, 2014 - there has been one other report of this sighting in Seattle.  It sounds like he was on the same hill as my son and reported a very similar description.)",

I was waiting for the Seattle 4th of July, 2014 fireworks to begin.  I was facing north, standing to the west side of the Museum of History and Industry at the South end of Lake Union.  I noticed one orange, non-blinking light appear high over the North end of the lake. More likely the light was over the Puget Sound.  The light moved slowly south and did not change size, color or brightness.   The first light was then followed by a second and a third at equal spacing, single file moving south.   When the lights were directly due west from me (over Queen Anne Hill) the lead light turned west and then disappeared but not behind the high cloud cover.  The second and third light followed the same route. Once the three lights were gone, a single orange none blinking light appeared at the same point of origin as the first three.  This single light stayed stationary.  At about the same time this single light appeared, 3 or 4 Helicopters moved to the West and could have been below the light. The sky was full of multiple aircraft and helicopters that night.  The marker and anti-collision lights are VERY obvious.  The lights I saw did not look or flash like aircraft lights. About 10 minutes later an orange light appeared as before, to the North of my location.  This time the second and third light appeared quicker and the three lights moved into a triangle position.  Again they moved South at the same speed and route as before.  The \u201clower\u201d appearing light moved in and out, changing the shape of the triangle.  Again once the lights were due west of me, they appeared to go west and then disappeared.  This time the high cloud cover was going. They simply went out. I did get pictures of the lights.",

It was around 10 pm on July 4, 2014, and I was out in the front yard of a friend on Queen Anne Hill in Seattle, waiting for the fireworks over Lake Union when seemingly out of nowhere three orange orbs appeared in the eastern sky; looked like they could have been over South Lake Union or Beacon Hill.  They weren\u2019t very big but clearly visible.   They hovered in a triangular shape for about 10-15 seconds -- one object above and two below that.  I told my friend, those are UFOs!  But he laughed and said, \"No they\u2019re not.\"   And I said, then what are they?  He had no answer.  The triangle moved slowly and in unison to the right (S) and moved behind a tree, so we ran over to the edge of the yard to see if we could track them.  I could see the orange lights through the branches.  (These objects were high in the sky; I don\u2019t mean they were behind this tree across the street.)   When they emerged, the orbs spread out into a line and the one farthest to the right turned and dropped a bit below the others.  Again, they just hovered for about 10 seconds.  I was slapping my friend on the back and saying, see, see, those are UFOs!  Then the one to the far right disappeared.  It was just gone.  The other two hung on for a few more seconds and then they, too, were gone, first one, then the other. Yes, there were many choppers and airplanes in the air waiting for the fireworks, but they were noisy and I could easily identify them as aircraft.  At the time we saw the orbs, all the aircraft were farther north and were clearly not near the objects. I flew airplanes as a student pilot years ago, and have many hours of flying time, including solo landings.  I know what aircraft are like and these were not conventional aircraft. The fireworks had not started so these were not fireworks.  Unless there\u2019s a new kind that can hover, turn, stop, and change formations in a crisp manner. I was thinking maybe they were flares, but they just didn\u2019t look like flares.  The orbs were not wavering, fuzzy, but very stable and clear in the sky. To the west, there was a quarter moon out, but again, it couldn\u2019t be confused with these very orange, very round, very clear objects that were hovering in front of us. I looked online the next day and somebody posted a video that shows an orange globe hovering and moving in the sky.  A commenter said it was a Chinese lantern, which, he said, were everywhere last night.  What we saw was not a lantern. When I got home last night, I called my son and told him about it and he said, wow, that\u2019s weird because I saw an orange object hanging over Beacon Hill about the same time.  He said he thought at first that it was a planet but it seemed too big for a planet and it was very round and orange. So, that whole experience was a first for me and my disbelieving friend who witnessed it with me.  I have no idea what they were but sure wish I could find out.",

      "story": "Seattle, east shore of Lake Union. Two fiery objects high in the sky before fireworks display. Neighbors gathered to see the fireworks display saw a fiery object high in the southwest sky and streaking toward the north.  First we thought it was a flare but it was much higher than a marine flare would be.  Some one speculated it could be space debris.  As it streaked downward 2 fiery tails came straight down and appeared to burn out before reaching the ground. A few minutes later we noted a fiery orange object high in the sky sky to the west.  It hovered at the same height for 1-2 minutes and then flew to the south at a constant height.  It no longer appeared fiery as it disappeared from view. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello, Peter, I listened to your appearance on the Jeff Rense program when you had guests on who saw the events before the Seattle fireworks on July 4, 2014.  My report is the one above.  I live in the Eastlake neighborhood, of Seattle, 1-1/2 blocks from Lake Union, in a condo.  We have a roof deck above the 3rd floor of the condo where we watch the fireworks every 4th of July. One of your guests seemed to think there was something ominous about the military helicopter carrying the American flag.  That has been a part of the Lake Union fireworks show for about 26 years, as long as I\u2019ve lived on the east shore of Lake Union.  When they first started the show years ago they had searchlights all around the lake to track the helicopter with flag.  But as budgets grew smaller, they went to the military helicopter with a light on the flag, which does not show off the flag as well as the searchlights did.  The helicopter always comes from the north, flies over Gas Works Park (where there is a big daylong event), and then flies around the lake shore before going back north. After I made the above report, I looked online to see if there were any reports about the events I saw.  The first object I saw was a white light streaking, like a shooting star or meteor.  But it suddenly broke into 2 tails that went directly down to the water.  Online I found information that skydivers were supposed to jump into the lake, wearing sparklers on their feet, and the promotional material said it would look like a meteor.  I could not find any news items that said the skydivers completed that dive, although I know skydivers landed at Gas Works Park in an earlier skydive as planned.  I don\u2019t know if that is the explanation for what I saw. I find it hard to believe that sparklers could be that bright. The other object I saw was a fiery, flaming thing. It was orange-red, like when you see a car burst into flames in the movies, as if fueled by gasoline or other accelerant. First I thought it might be a sky lantern, because I frequently see sky lanterns launched from that area - North Queen Anne Hill, in the vicinity of the Lake Washington Ship Canal.  But the flames were so big and bright I did not think a sky lantern could have that much fuel. My next thought was it could be an aircraft on fire, but then it would have crashed. Instead, the flames disappeared.  Then from that location in the sky I saw a steady blue light moving across the sky, I estimate at the same height an airliner at cruising altitude would be, and in about the same location as I often see aircraft.  But the light was steady blue, not flashing, and no other lights were visible.  This light maintained a constant speed from north to south (as I looked toward the west), and I saw it go behind a cloud and then reappear until it disappeared from my view.  Here\u2019s what I found on one online description of the skydivers: Skydivers If you're going to Gasworks Park for the 4th of July celebration, fireworks won't be the only things in the sky you'll be seeing. Skydivers from Shelton company Skydive Kapowsin will be jumping into the Gasworks Park area twice as part of the fireworks show. The first jump will be into the Gasworks Park crowd at 7:30 p.m., while the second jump at 10:10 p.m. will be into the water at Lake Union. The second jump will feature skydivers wearing wingsuits with lights on them, so look for their bright lights to be screeching across Lake Union. ____________________________________________________________________________________ I\u2019m not sure if this makes things more clear or more confusing, but I realized I hadn\u2019t mentioned the blue light before. Thanks,",

Now the entire moon (which was in crescent form btw) was encased in what looked like a large yellow glowing...light I guess.

Just then from what looked like the bottom tip/point of the moon, directly under the bottom point in the moon, and this yellow glow around the moon was still apparent and actually blocked a little of the vision of where this \"debris\" came from---but anyway     From this area in the sky, and out of nowhere it seemed, fell these flaming large objects.  It started as a huge mass and I didn't know whether I was watching a meteor, something on fire in the sky falling or what?     Anyway, this mass broke off into what looked like 2 fragments but could well have been more...could only see this initial fiery breaking down of whatever was falling. Soon after the breaking down, just like some normal thing in flames, it went out, and I feel I could tell for only a second that when the flames went out there was still an object in free fall. My boyfriend and I had been talking to one another the whole time.  He saw everything as well, and it truly perplexed us!  Main firework show had not begun, a lot of air traffic out there in the skies, which kept my boyfriend and I checking out the different aircrafts. We looked to the TV for any explanation...where we saw in text under the news reporters that sky divers were falling.  Which I thought was odd and rather dangerous, but kind of bought it and put my guard down. I looked dramatically for anything similar to that all night.  Nothing matched what I saw.  And I was outside for awhile.  Various fireworks and cannons and aircrafts could not be substituted for the large mass descending completely on fire.",

It looked to be just below some white clouds and was moving slowly to the South.  The object appeared to be over the south end of Boeing field off the I-5.   I observed it for approximately 3-4 minutes, as it moved to the South over South Center shopping area, at which time it disappeared into the clouds.   At one point, while I was observing the object, a commercial plane flew by from the North and looked to be fairly close to the object.   I did capture this sighting on my IPhone at full zoom (466Megabits).  The object was round in shape, metallic looking and appeared to reflect the sun.   I will also say that, to me, it appeared to move in a deliberate fashion from the North to the South.

To my pleasant surprise, just two months since my first UFO sighting over Lake Union in Seattle, I witnessed four unusual light shapes again tonight - very close to the same location they made their appearance in July.  What caught my eye this evening were 4 bright lights slightly north east of the Space Needle from my vantage point where I was gazing south toward the Space Needle. Each object appeared triangular shaped with lights at each point. However, it seemed there was a light in the center of each as well.  They struck me initially as probably being lanterns, though unusually shaped if in fact lanterns.  As I kept my eye on them they did not seem to characterize lanterns floating through the air due to their tight triangular formation while moving upward then sideways in perfect synchronicity.  One object was positioned to the left of the other three in their triangular formation.  The object on the left from my view faded within approximately 20 seconds after I first spotted them all. I snapped a 26 second video, then two photos of the remaining three objects from my iPhone while standing on my front deck then lost view as they moved further east and were hidden behind a neighboring building.  I ran through my house and up my dock to zoom in on them once again.  I was able to snap two more photos, though they did not appear clearly in the brighter light from this angle.  They seemed to turn southward and disappeared within about 20 more seconds from my new viewing spot. Following their disappearance there was a single helicopter hovering over the middle of Lake Union facing the direction these objects had been seen. I will include the video clip and the original two photos that are the most clear I was able to capture. ((NUFORC Note:  Second similar sighting by the same witness over Lake Union.

They appeared to lose brightness as they traversed the sky but remained clearly visible in the sliver of sky I was able to see.   No sooner did the tandem lights disappear from my field of view than another single light appear traversing the same piece of sky at about the same position of the lower light in the tandem grouping.  Same bright orange characteristic moving about the same speed.  The apparent magnitude of these lights were brighter than the brightest planet I have ever seen. They were not airplanes as I saw an airplane in the same section of sky and was easily able to compare the events.  I am an engineer working in aviation so know the difference.  In fact, I am attributing these lights to satellites reflecting the sun but since I have never seen three satellites traversing the night sky almost simultaneously and at that magnitude of brightness, I felt like I should report the event.",

I was scanning the clear summer night sky, as I often did with my low powered telescope, when a cubical \"L\" shaped object was observed.  It filled a sixth of the view.  It looked like perfectly sculpted stone, lit lightly by the moon.  It had to be in low orbit, since it looked large with my small scope.   I ran to call my brother to see it.  He came bounding down the stairs.  Quickly, I told him what I saw.  He knelt down and witnessed it as well.  I told him I wanted to see it again, and he let me.   It slowly moved out of view.  A tree was blocking further view.  It was 1966.   I saw the movie \"2001\" in 1968 and wondered why I saw what I saw.",

After about 10 minutes of watching it completely still, it slowly started gaining altitude and moving to the east, bery slowly.  Occasionally, I would lose sight of it, due to cloud coverage, but soon after the clouds passed, I would see it again, still moving very slowly and still gaining altitude.  I would see it often turn from white to red.  Not in a blinking fashion but in a very smooth transition from white to red.  This total sighting lasted about 40 minutes. Then I lost sight of it.

Some seemed allot closer then others.   The first set of three I noticed were very large in the sky.  They appeared out of nowhere and disappeared without any speed or movement.  There was no noise, smell, contrail, or erratic movement.   They usually appeared in groups of three and spread out over the horizon in a triangle formation, although they did not keep a tight triangle formation.  They didn't flicker, and the colors were fairly constant.  I assumed that they were lanterns, but they seem too bright and too round.  But their movement and disappearance would be consistent with lanterns.  It was also new years eve which makes me think they are lanterns.   The appeared and disappeared for around 20 minutes to a half and hour.  On viewing the video #1750, I noticed a second light or lights above the \"lantern.\"  This light can be viewed on at the 8 to 10 second part.  It is directly above the \"lantern\" and appears and disappears and changes color from red to blue to white.

      "story": "1-2 orange fireball objects in the sky At 12:10 AM, I looked out the window to watch the local territorial New Year\u2019s fireworks. The night sky was clear of haze or clouds, which is unusual for our area this time of year.  High in the sky (much higher than the city fireworks displays), I saw a bright orange round \u2018fireball\u2019.   The object looked unusual to me, so I grabbed my 50x binoculars to get a closer look. Watching through the binoculars, I could see that the fireball was slowly moving from east to west.   After a few minutes, a commercial airplane flew from west to east, lower in the sky than the object, perhaps originating from SeaTac airport.  As the airplane neared the fireball vertically, the orange fireball light went out, but I could see the faint circular or oval shape of the object since I had been tracking it through the binoculars.   After a minute or two the outline became fainter and I lost visual track of the object even through my binoculars. The orange object reappeared after a few minutes moving lower in the sky from west to east.  I had the other witness look through the window and by then we observed two orange objects moving from west to east.  We lost view of the objects as they past our local tree line after a few minutes. I have never seen this type of flying object. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Well, to tell the truth I am actually in Renton, but I put in a nearby Seattle area with a different zip code with a similar view in order to remain somewhat anonymous online. So you could use Bryn Mawr as the neighborhood online if you would like to be more specific. I was intrerested to see that you seem to have received quite a few orange fire ball type sightings from across the country.  Thanks for your reporting database. ((END ADDENDUM)) (( ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) BTW, if you are trying to pinpoint a latitude and longitude, I would estimate the first orb to be over Tukwila or Kent, WA. ((END ADDENDUM))",

Size of craft was approx. 75 feet long and 10-15 feet wide.  Location:  Inverness neighborhood- North Seattle. After school, two friends and I witnessed a large, sleek saucer type UFO.  It was dull grey in color and exhibited a thin band of red pulsating light that traveled quickly around the center body of the craft.  It hovered approximately 1500-2000 feet off the ground and was not far away from our position.   The craft would remain stationary, then quickly traveled in an elliptical path of 100-125 yards only to return to its original position and again quietly hover in place.  It traveled in this pattern four times.   A Seattle Police helicopter flew into the area, and proceeded to engage the UFO.  As soon as the helicopter neared the craft, it silently sped off and was out of sight in seconds.

PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter,  I'm sorry about the input error.   I don't recall the exact date in April 1972.  However, I know for certain it was on a Friday.  So the four possible dates would be 4/7, 4/14, 4/21,or 4/28.  I did not want to guess as which Friday the sighting occurred, so I left it as 4/00/1972.   I'm not sure why 1972 did not come out correctly? Next week, I plan to speak with my two friends and encourage them to report the sighting on the database as well.  Will they be required to fill out their names, address, etc?  (Even though the information is held in confidence, I think it will be problematic for them to complete that step).  Please advise.

I was facing west, the point of ligh was at a 10 o'clock position and heading in a southerly direction.  Instinct indicated an altitude of a commercial jet at cruising altitude, but it might well have been beyond the atmosphere.  What caught my attention was the lack of strobes.  We live just east of Boeing Field with it traffic as well as inbound/outbound flights from SeaTac are also clearly visible from our home.  I was beginning to think I was viewing a satellite, but it didn't have the look of something high enough to be in orbit, then it changed course.  It was at this point I pointed it out to others around me.   The object altered its course gently to a an easterly heading where it held that heading for maybe 5 seconds before gently altering to a southerly course which was held for 5 seconds. It then gently altered it course again to due west for about 5 seconds, before vanishing.   The area of sky covered would have been roughly the area of 2 fists held at arm's length, and the speed was roughly what satellites travel.  It was a constant smooth motion.",

Let me preface this by saying I have had these images for over a year now without thinking much about them, but it was reading Leslie Kean's book, UFOs:  Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record that gave me a clear understanding of the reality of this phenomenon.  After seeing the HUGE number of reports of objects similar to what I saw I felt I needed to report this. I was at Gas Works Park for the fireworks display last year and I had my iPhone out to try and take pictures of the Chinook helicopter that carries the American flag on a lap around Lake Union before the fireworks start.  As I was looking around the sky I noticed three bright orange lights moving around slowly making no noticeable noise.  I took three photos of the lights over the course of 1 or 2 minutes while I was pointing them out to my friends. There were aircraft in the air and skydivers coming down from them as part of the show, but I am convinced these lights were something different altogether.  I have gone skydiving and live next to a small airport and I know the sound of those small planes fairly well. As bright as these objects were they would have been making some kind of sound if they were small planes or helicopters. After watching them for maybe 5 minutes the fireworks show started and I don't remember seeing them during or after the show. Sending the three photos of the objects as well as a shot of downtown looking south from the same location.",

Started moving towards downtown seattle no sound could be heard at all I also want to add there where no planes around at first which was strange cuase there always is, as it cont.  There was a small plane off to the distance like past downtown seattle and much further up in the sky it seemed and aircraft ? /ship or /ships( will get to that in a moment) it moved swiftly towards sm. aircraft as if it had no worries to crashing into but didn't, it hovered for a moment and changed course and again no planes no drones ect were in the sky it was also a very clear evening in the skies, so it started towards wallingford, freemont area ,if you know ballard im going to give you an example of how big this thing was or appeared from 15th n.w. looking towarrds the hill that goes to wallingford is a few miles no.  And so.  Bounds and this craft was literally covering almost the entire hill still in almost invisible motion and still very low im talking like almost right on top of houses .we both are tripping jaws hanging all i could say is it has to be a stealth moving as it was it was becoming more and more transparent it was a triangle shape and black and huge i mean huge.  I said we gotta see what this thing is and where the blank is it going my friend can only say what is that almost speechless almost frozen in augh. We followed it up the hill , now on aurora ave n. going south my friend pulled out his brother binaculars that are little more advance ( used in maritime) and handed me his phone to take pic's instead i hit record and it d! id for a few seconds then, my friend switched with me so i cou! ld see a better shot to be able to tell him what it is . We cont. driving so down aurora it started to lightly rain, me looking at craft but also the road, i had pulled over a cpl times too let friend take photos well in the meantime he stuck out his hand with camara out the window and was video taping ,at this point we could see what looked like a ring of bright red lights just for a brief moment underneath it . We both were taking about how nobody i mean nobody the entire time had stopped , pointing or looking up at it and can't believe no one else is seeing what were seeing even on busy aurora ave no one even blew their horn or stopped further down to see what were looking at, which is strange cause if and when i see people as in grossed as we were looking up at something its natural habit to also look as far as im concerned from experience. All of a sudden it had vanished mind you still no sound at all nor planes, drones ect.in these moments i had got on the phone to tell a frie! nd to look up in the sky to see it ( he lives in renton area), he kind of chuckled and laugh and said said something silly im kind of known as being a goof ball really meaning being silly to make people have a smile and laugh ? and my friend traveling with me well i'll describe him as being stuck in the 80's which i'm also known for too. We continued to look for it as we drove towards the friend in rentons house, both in just aughh trying figure out what on gods green earth did we just experience and why no one seemed a bit cauntious of any thing but what they were doing my friend was trying to look back at video but a lil hard on sm screen but never the less it was there in fact theres more than one as well as photos well you might think this was the end of it ,yeah no theres more , my friend could not stop with almost obsessing of it? As we picked our other friend up in renton , i mentioned to first friend look Now theres all kind of planes up in the sky as we drove south! to my house ( bonney lake) we were at boeing field area and w! e notice d two planes that did actually look like our military helicopters there was twoo and they were in like a certain position as though they were protecting or watching or guiding something slowly moving they become into a different formation , one slightly lower than other and was moving down towards the ground then there were a bunch of planes coming from all angles going into boeing field as well as seatac and most likely renton airfield as well it was crazy. So my friend quit in the back seat except for a few uttered words ( what the heck was that ,still looking at pic's and video ,we soon discovered ( here's where i mentioned i would get to later ) well it seemed as though there may have been more than one craft and that they looked as if they flew into the bigger one not only that and many lights flying around in speratic motions there is what we have learned to be a devil or evil figurine in a red light cloud that appears as if was watching us amongst other formations of different objects very clearly seen ( also later everyone who has viewed it agreed).  My friend is now in a spooked mood but still cant get over it he continued to look up in the sky as i did too and still, well he had been looking out my kitchen window and was seeing objects again but smaller in size like orb size in a neighbors yard and came to get me too see i told him its just porch or garage lights of neighbors he again began to video tape and well theres many suspected things seen including the very pronounced red cloud demon he was so scared he couldn't leave my room I tried to distract him by telling him it was probly this or that just to ease his mind.  Well there's a short almost thorough detailed story of my moment with what seemed to be not of this world as i've known it , my friend however has really looked in more depth to video's and pic's and will have more to add to his . Thank you for your time ((name and e-mail address deleted))",

      "story": "Circular red object paralleling airplane after takeoff from Seatac On April 19th, 2015, I was outside on my deck located in West Seattle (a neighborhood just Southwest ) of the main downtown core of Seattle, WA, with an approx. 240 degree view from N-NW to S-SW with Boeing Field (KBFI ) and Seatac Intl airport ( KSEA ) flight lines in view at all times of the day and night. At approx 11:10 pm PST I witnessed a twin propeller Alaska airlines flight (I know the airplane and carrier from experience and flight paths) depart Seatac Intl. airport and fly due north before making a westward turn towards my location at the above address. When the airplane was almost directly overhead (approx 85-87 degrees), I witnessed what appeared to be a very bright red circular object/orb appear off the right wing of the plane. This bright red object followed the plane before I ran to the sliding door on our deck and called for my girlfriend to come witness this object and as she came outside, the object disappeared but during the time I witnessed the object it paralleled the airplane off the right wing in perfect alignment with the airplane in a westward direction before disappearing. My girlfriend and I were on the deck and as I am showing as well as describing what I saw to her, a very bright streak appeared directly overhead moving West to East in what I approximate to be the very same path the object I initially saw take with the airplane. This streak was very sudden and abrupt and travelling at extreme speed (I did NOT see an object with this \"streak\" whatever it was ) but found it to be coincidental considering what I had just witnessed.",

This evening, I looked up and saw a light source going around and around. I stopped to watch it, to  try to figure out what it was.  I'm familiar with the way the way the attention-getting search lights used by businesses look when they shine up into the sky.  This was not like them.  This appeared to be a light source that was coming from above the clouds--not from below.  It was a diffused light, moving in a clock-wise direction and completing a circle about once every second.  The relative size of the source was about the size of a full moon.  It went on for about 20 minutes.  The circumference of the circle was hard to quantify, but I would estimate it to be about 5 to 10 percent of the overhead sky. I watched this light for about 20 minutes, as I walked the dog. It suddenly stopped--it didn't get smaller as if moving away--it simply stopped. I called it into! the Seattle Police Department and the person on the phone suggested I call the phone number for reporting UFOs. I called the number and spoke with a gentleman who asked that I submit a brief written description of the incident.  As a side note, I'm a photographer and used to observing light. This truly looked like a light source that was coming from above the clouds.  The area of this observation was from SW Monroe St and 39th Ave SW to SW Rose St. and 39th Ave SW in West Seattle, WA.

My boyfriend and I stepped onto our back porch, and I looked up and saw a solid black, tear shaped, almost hairy looking (I know that sounds weird but it wasn't shiny and there seemed to be something around it that gave it a spiky looking texture), object, headed 150 degrees SE of Seattle at around 3,500-4,000 ft.  It moved slowly, almost a floating motion with absolutely no sound, no lights. The moon was almost full, half of the sky was clear and the other half had low incoming clouds.  The object flew through the direct moonlight but there was no moonlight reflection on the object as if the object surface was a flat black.   The object seemed to slow down and hover as it reached a large group of clouds and became harder and harder to see, its outline became vague and soon, I could no longer spot it.  It seemed to camouflage itself against sky.  When it was against the clear sky, it was impossible to see until it was in the moonlight.  It ended up kind of blending with the clouds it approached.  Size wise, it was smaller than a 747, but larger than a minivan.   My boyfriend didn't have his glasses on so he did not see the details I did but he did see its movement.

      "story": "Strange flashes of light on a clear night in Sno-King area of WA. At around midnight, I started watching a movie on television.  For the record, the movie was \"Straight Out Of Compton\", which I mention only to disway any notions that I was watching anything related to the paranormal and my imagination got the best of me; thoughts of UFOs were very far from my mind!  Just to the left of my TV is a large, south-facing window that I keep open this time of year.  While there are a few tall but thin trees across the street from me, I have a pretty good view of the sky from where I was sitting (on my couch).   There was not a cloud in the sky this night.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what I initially thought was a distant lightning strike as the entire skyline lit up enough to put the trees in silhouette.  But.... no thunder... I dismissed it, believing perhaps a distant power transformer had popped...even though the hue of the light was markedly blue.   Ten to fifteen minutes later, it happened again.  At this point i! dismissed it as some kind of visual distortion... it was late...perhaps i had my eyes open too long and glanced at the window and imagined the flash...and as I was looking out the window, it happened again. My cat started going berserk about this time.  Normally, he is lazy.  Suddenly he was all about chasing invisible things, and meowing incessently. This went on until approximately 3am, at seemingly irregular intervals.  I finally decided to get up, go outside with ALL of my house lights off and look to the sky to make sure I was actually seeing what I thought I was seeing.  I noticed that the dogs in the neighborhood were quite vocal, which is unusual. I was nearly finished with my cigarette, when *FLASH* it happened again.  I immediately activated the stop watch on my iphone to see if in fact the flashes were occurring at regular intervals or not...and, of course, not a single other flash happened after that... I did not see any *craft* per se, but this was bizarre... and after reading the post from thie person in Renton on the same night at the same time, I felt highly compelled to let them know that they were not alone in seeing this strangeness.   Renton is to the south of me, so it stands to reason we saw the same phenomenon.",

Those two slow moving lights came to rest after about 12 seconds (appearing tethered like two a moored boats), remaining the same distance from each other, swaying slightly, about four fingers apart. The third light in the formation that moved much-much faster, was quickly out of our view because of the house/roof (like 3 seconds). So we watched the two \"tethered\" lights for about 8 minutes.  Then another light came back from the same direction as the fast moving third one, like it had done a u-turn, flew right back at the same speed.  It went right between the two \"tethered\" lights, and kept going until out of sight (north). We watched those two steady \"tethered\" lights until they started to fade with the sunrise and we went inside, at least another 40 minutes til we turned in. Unique, to say the least.

I had just started the trial, I had a feeling to look up and notice what to me appear to be a ball of light getting closer.  I thought maybe it's just a plane flying by, and I was wrong, this was a pulsating Orb, it was changing colors from violet, to green and white.  So I was to capture 50 seconds of film from my iPhone 6.  Notice from the film, the Orb would disappear in some parts of the clip and negative photos show that the UFO is solid.

Over a period of two minutes, the white cloud began to behave in an odd manner as it drifted, and then moved very rapidly to the west, straight away from Rainier, maintaining a constant elevation.  As we were watching, the cloud abruptly stopped, and then dissolved before our eyes. Airplanes could be seen it the same general area, before, during and after the cloud was seen moving.

There were about 14 of us in 3 different vehicles.  I'm not from the area, so couldn't say what road we were on, but coming from that college driving only about less than 10 minutes, when one of the girls says, \"Oh my God, what is that?\"  The tone in her voice had us all leaning to look out the right windows of our van.  The round was curving around a very big hill.  It was dark.  But when I looked up into the sky what I saw shocked and amazed and scared me. What I saw was this:  A large, so large it took up most of the sky, diamond-shaped UFO hovering, not moving, over this big hill right next to us.  We were right beside it.  It had 4 perfect edges to it, and all were touching.  It's hard to explain, but think if you will a black diamond cut from paper and holding a light behind it in an otherwise dark room.  It was illuminated from above. We were stuck to that window, and you could feel the fear from all.  I thought, \"This is it.  We are having contact, invasion.\"   It lasted only five minutes as we were still driving, and as we got further away, we couldn't pull over.  We were driving caravan with 2 other vehicles, and it was a busy road. When we got back to the hotel, the other two vehicles had seen it as well, and you can imagine the the excited conversation, so we all piled into one room and turned on the tv, only to wait until the very end of the segment for a 30 second blurb that it was space junk.  It was good enough for everyone I was with.  Coaches, too.  They all quickly dismissed it as space junk, while I was the ONLY one who quickly dismissed the space junk theory. Huge diamond shape object with 4 clearly distinguisable lines completely connected, and it looked like it had a orange fire above it.  It never moved.

As I was returning into the yard, because of the slope, my face was pointing at an upward angle and I saw an object that looked like a small black mound (upon reflection it seemed like a small black cloud) about 12 feet long.  At first, I thought a bunch of balloons because of its silence.  Then I thought a drone because of it\u2019s speed.  But I realized that it was too dense to be a drone(unless a drone can fly with a blanket over it) and it was too consistent in shape for balloons tied together. This was at (according to a later compass reading) NNW 290 degrees, 20 feet above the trees across the street, and about 250 feet away. It proceeded in a horizontal line.  After staring at it for 10 seconds I ran into the house to get the binoculars as for some reason even though that close it didn\u2019t seem distinct. As I came back out of the house (I later timed it) 62 seconds later and ran into the street it took a few moments to locate.  It was now I estimate over Lowman Beach, about 2-3 blocks away.  It was much smaller due to distance away and I could not bring it into focus. There was little to no wind yet this thing may have been moving 15-20mph. No one else was at home and I didn\u2019t call neighbors as I just wanted to get binoculars and get a good look myself first.",

I called Seattle Center to ask if they had anything on radar and was told they did not.  I then asked my passenger if he saw the lights and he said yes.  I asked him if he was in a hurry and he said he was not, so I called Seattle Center again and informed them that I would like to divert to investigate these lights over the Space Needle.   I made a right turn and headed for the Space Needle and the 4 red lights but the closer I got to the lights the more the lights moved upward in front of me.

      "story": "Six fast white spheres appear briefly in the night sky flying north to south. Last night I was skywatching with binoculars in the hopes of seeing anomalous craft.  This is an activity that I do along withy my brother with some frequency in the summer.  In the last few weeks we've seen some strange fireballs and flashes that couldn't be accounted for by known aircraft or satellites. My process with the binoculars is to watch one area of the sky for a few minutes, then move to another area and wait.  I often can see satellites not visible to the naked eye this way, and I can track them across the sky easily with the binoculars.  I am an experienced skywatcher and can distinguish most aircraft, satellites, and meteors. I was looking towards the west and a series of objects entered the frame of the binoculars from the north.  It consisted of six white spheres arranged in a straight line, but the line itself was oriented maybe 15 degrees to the right of the direction of travel.  A good analogy is if you took a v-shaped flock of flying geese and removed half the geese. I immediately started tracking the objects across the sky until they reached the horizon to the south.  The binoculars I was using were 7x zoom, and the full width of the formation filled roughly one third of the view area of the binoculars.  The formation was very fast, from the moment I began tracking it to the moment it was beyond the horizon was less than three seconds.  The spheres themselves were several times larger than a commercial airliner appears in the binoculars at cruising altitude (30,000 feet).  The objects themselves appeared to be quite high, but judging by their size it seems unlikely they were in space. The objects themselves are difficult to describe because of their speed.  They obviously were lit, but only dimly.  It almost appeared if they were a projection, perhaps semi-transparent.  They somewhat reminded me of seeing spotlights projected onto clouds when I was a child, but the sky was clear and there was nothing to project onto.",

      "story": "Stationary Object With Extension Emerging Retracting High Above SeaTac or Boeing Field. Having just paid, we lined up for the Bainbridge Island ferry in downtown Seattle, on the north side of Colman Dock.  At the time it was 81 degrees F, the skies were clear and blue and visibility was good. After walking to the end of the dock to take photos I returned to the car.  At about 7pm, while watching a jet flying overhead, I noticed (also to the south) a white round or oval object a bit to the west of and much higher up than the jet.  It did not seem to be either taking off or landing so I watched it.  After a few minutes it remained in place so I pointed it out to my husband. He thought its shape was odd (not plane-like).  At first he thought it was moving but after observing it for a minute or so said it was remaining in place. At about 7:05pm we both saw something extend out of it temporarily (for between 15 to 20 seconds).  The extension appeared smaller than and the same color white as the main object and it too was also round or circular.  At 7:05pm I took one photo of the object with my cell phone. After maybe 30 seconds the same object emerged from the main object again.  Again it retracted into the main object.  Thereafter, during the entire time we watched, this happened at the same intervals regularly.  The second object may not have been extending and retracting but only appearing to as perhaps the entire object may have been rotating with something extended from it.  It was too far to tell. After watching for a bit the second object appeared to me to be an arm with something circular at the end of the arm.  My husband saw a round object emerging and returning to the main round object (no arm).  He thought the extension was maybe another (a second) circular object like the main one. At no time did we see anything actually leave the main object.  We agreed as we watched that it was not a plane, conventional drone, kite, blimp, or helicopter (it had no tail, wings, or rotor).  We did not hear any noise from it.  At 7:08 I took a second photo of it with my cell phone. We tried but could not identify it and got back into the car to wait (where it was cooler because of the A/C).  We each looked at the object every so often.  At around 7:10pm my husband said it was slowly fading.  I looked and thought it was maybe drifting south but my husband thought it was slowly ascending.  After a couple of minutes we could no longer find it. Though the line for the Bainbridge Island ferry was about one third full by 7:05pm during the sighting I did not notice anyone else watching it.  There were cars lined up on the south side of the ferry terminal heading to Bremerton but I could not see them so I do not know if anyone there saw it. Based on its relative position: to us where we were on Colman Dock and to the various jets we saw take off, it appeared to have been over Boeing Field or SeaTac Airport, but was at a much higher elevation than the jets taking off.  As it was far above us, there was no way to estimate its size. Neither of us ever did identify it. Of the two photos I took, neither is a good photo but after zooming in fully, the object is visible in each photo.  In the 7:05pm photo it is a white diamond shape with rounded diamond points.   In the 7:08pm photo it is smaller than it is in the first photo, and not a diamond but a blurry conical shape.  No extension is visible in either photo.",

      "story": "Pure round white light 20 feet in diameter floated directly over us at tree top level after midnight. Seattle July 1986, after midnight sometime.  13 years old. Sleeping outside with a friend under a clear night sky, as we did quite often in the summer months.  We both were still very much wide awake not knowing the exact time when a pure round solid white light approx. 20 feet in diameter floated slowly and directly over the top of us at tree top level from east to west.  It lighted up the tops of the trees.  There was no noise, no wind, no vibration.  Moving slowly at maybe 1-2 mph.  Approx. 20 seconds total.  No reaction from us...couldn't talk or move from fear.   After it passed and was gone we both looked at each other and said let's get the hell out of here.  We hurried inside and went to sleep.  The very strange thing is we didn't talk about it at all.  Uncharacteristically, we both just went straight to sleep. Next morning, during breakfast, my friend brought it up to his dad and was scolded for lying.  We didn't talk about it again until years later as I moved out of state that month.  As adults years later our stories had one frightening difference.  My friend's recollection was that the object stopped briefly above us.  I remember it moving continuously until out of view.  Still bothers me to this day 33 years later. Also I was very keen on nearly every type of aircraft as it was my passion back then.  I had never heard anything of UFOs back then...  And I'd say the reason I didn't give chase in curiosity as I normally would have was out of fear.  I still haven't to this day been able to explain what it was or have I ever seen anything close to this object since then. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Red & Green Blinking lights (Airplane imitation) & Later A Red & Green Alternating Light Craft. 1/25/2019 Green and Red Light Sightings, Seattle, Washington.  The First UFO  \tI was driving home on I-5 North-bound, just South of Downtown Seattle coming from the West Seattle Bridge.  This was bout a week or a little more after the Alaska Way viaduct closed, so all the North-bound traffic was backed up on I-5, on top of the usual slow rush hour traffic of the Seattle area.  Barely creeping along, often stopped completely, I sat in what looked like a river of red lights in front of me.  Having little better to do than to look out my windshield and wait for the traffic to move, something out of the ordinary caught my eye.  It had red and green blinking lights on it, much like the airplanes that are frequently passing over Seattle to land at the Sea-Tac Airport South of the city.  What was different about this is that it was not moving, it was sitting stationary in the same place in dark sky. \tI watched this object blink with red and green lights like an airplane for several minutes, and it definitely did not move.  It was sitting in the sky, close to street lights, maybe a little bit higher, directly above the freeway packed with hundreds of cars.  When I got closer to it, it was still in the same place, I just watched it carefully, and it was not attached to a tower, (it was a little way south of the downtown skyscrapers), and not something attached to a street light either.  When I got close enough to try to capture a video of this object while I was stopped, but then the cars in front of me started to move again, so I had to move forward.  Just after I stopped again and got a good look at this object with red and green lights, it was still in the same spot, but it started rotating and I saw its white headlights at least twice.  After two or three rotations it started to slowly fly away from me, and disappeared over a hill to the southeast of where I was.  This was ! odd to me because all of the other planes I observed that night flew southward, toward either Boeing or Sea-Tac airports.  Because it started moving shortly after I was about to started filming, it would have looked like a normal airplane moving through the night sky. \tMy feeling is that this object was a 3D hologram projection that looked like an airplane, but was most likely an alien craft in reality.  It was probably able to sense when I was about to start filming, and then it started moving after that.  I feel that it could have also been an ET craft with occupants aboard who were aware of me, and wanted to show me what they can do and/or give me a sign.  I have absolutely no idea if any other drivers or people in the area saw this object.  Multiple airplanes flew overhead while this object sat stationary in the air, below the level of the other planes.  Again, it looked like an airplane with a red and a green light that would blink every second or so. The Second UFO \tLater this evening, I was walking my dog in my neighborhood in Northeastern Seattle, when I looked up into one area of the clear night sky, I saw another unidentified object, also with red and green lights.  This second one appeared a lot like a large star in the sky, less radiant, but still colored light, but with alternating red and green lights, where the the earlier one had blinking red and green lights.  This second object also looked like one spherical light of alternating red and green, never dark.  I watched this object for at least a minute, and it was not moving through the sky, not like an airplane would.  When I got to a spot where I could try to film it with my iPhone, I zoomed in and could pick up something faintly, but then it started moving away from me, in a similar fashion as the earlier object.  As it was moving away from me in a northwestern direction, it was no longer green, and became a red blinking light. \tBoth of the unidentified flying objects I witnessed on this night, of January 25th, 2019, hovered and moved silently as far as I could tell. Both moved very smoothly through the sky, and both seemed to know when I was watching and trying to film them.  I am certain these red and green lighted objects were not ordinary terrestrial objects, I have lived in Seattle all of my life and am very familiar with how airplanes and satellites look in the night sky.",

It was to the left of the moon.  As I was looking around at the stars around the moon, I realized this was moving west.  It looked like one of the other stars, with the same white-bluish color, there was no flashing or any change in color or any trace behind its movement.  As I was watching it travel, at that distance must have been going close to warp speed :), its light just vanished into deep space.  It simply disappeared. UFO? or what? It was not a plane for sure, nor a satellite as the light just vanished. I'd like to know if anyone else saw this. (Oct. 6, 2019 8:10pm)",
