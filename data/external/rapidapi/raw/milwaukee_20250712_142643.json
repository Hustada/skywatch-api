      "story": "Milwaukee-- one winged, silent, brightest lights, huge, 1993 I was a passenger in a vehicle with three other people (a friend, his brother, his mom, me).  We were traveling from Milwaukee south to Kenosha on a road running parallel and just east of I-94.  We first noticed what we thought was a plane flying very low with extremely bright lights flying directly at us.  The plane took a long time to reach us and eventually we pulled over to witness this flyby.  The three lights were so bright.   We pulled the car over and turned off the engine.  The craft was flying around 100 ft off the ground\u2014amazing.  It was all-white, one winged, no windows, and had to be two stories thick but rounded with slightly swept back wings.  The most amazing part was it made no noise!  It looked like it weighed 300 tons, as big as a passenger jet but much thicker.  Moreover, it was flying no more than 15 mph.  I had a good long look at it 100 feet away.  It flew right along the west side of the road.  By far the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever seen.   I\u2019ve told the story many times with a response most often of \u201chm.\u201d  I have yet to look on the site but more people had to see this thing.  It was flying in the direction of the Mitchell airport, so I\u2019ve always wondered if it landed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Golden orb follows car, then changes into black triangle ufo, stops , and \"waits\" for them to pass close by. It was New Years day, 1998. Approximately 10:55 pm in Wisconsin, USA.  Three people were driving from Milwaukee to West Allis on a routine 20 minute drive to drop off a companion on a cold New Year's night. While on the apex of a bridge adjacent to an industrial area, the back passenger spotted a golden light, flashing at a rate of about 4 flashes per second, moderately high in the dark southwestern sky [see FIGURE 1]. It was about the size and color of a small, golden street light, fixed in the sky behind and to the left of the vehicle. The back-seat passenger alerted the driver and the front passenger to the peculiarity of the light, and they all thought it might be some sort of \"helicopter\" or \"star\". As there was hardly any traffic, the driver slowed the vehicle down between 10 to 15 mph.  The object conspicuously glided down towards the ground and closer to the observers. It ceased flashing and became a solid \"gold-light orb\" [see FIGURE 2]. Now seeming to be only a few blocks away to their left (west), it began to parallel the movement of the vehicle\u2014keeping up with its exact speed.. It was fairly low to the ground because it was somewhat being obscured by some thin tree branches (without leaves) along the roadside.  The vehicle, now having passed off the bridge, continued to move northbound towards a major intersection. As the driver slowed even more to get into the left-hand turn lane at a stop light, a red light rotated around the left side of the object, and then a blue light rotated around to the right side of the object. Both lights stopped at the visible edges and remained fixed at the object's respective sides for only a moment\u2014disappearing within seconds [see FIGURE 3]. At this point the object was moving at its slowest. Because of the sudden appearance of the \u201cpolice\u201d lights and its speed, the witnesses concluded that it must be a police helicopter on a mission.  As the car sat at a complete stop in the left-hand turn lane, there were a few cars to the right of the vehicle. But people in those cars were not looking toward the object, which was traveling at a laborious pace very low to the ground (perhaps a 100 ft). It could barely be seen unless you were looking for it. As the object began to cross over the avenue they were going to turn onto (west), it now appeared to \u201cbranch out\u201d into a string of five pale-white lights. It moved silently, almost at \u201cwalking speed\u201d. The witnesses rationalized that it might be some sort of plane trying to make an emergency landing - but why land perpendicular to the street?  The lights suddenly stopped and became fixated directly above an estimated seven story factory building just two blocks away. The traffic light changed to green, and the driver finally turned left toward the object; it was just up ahead. No other cars or people were out on this usually busy street. Curiosity and perplexity filled the witnesses as they moved closer to the building.  Finally, the car pulled over to the side of the road. The back passenger rolled down his window and stuck his head out of the car to observe what could be resting in the sky above. The other two people strained to get a good view from the front passenger window. What seemed like a string of lights from a few blocks away on approach were actually the lights on the \"front\" and underneath of a large, black, equilateral triangle object. The five lights shown down like \"baseball stadium lights\", and were located at all three corners and in the middle of the two \"front\" sides [see FIGURE 4].  This large object was \u201cfixed\u201d in the air, producing absolutely no noise, movement, or flashing. Everything around them seemed so still, almost like they were in a vacuum and \u201cweren\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d The body of the triangle was colored charcoal-black, with a faint, grayish grove running along the front tip to the back center. There were visible sides: the edges showing a continuous grayish-black indentation with a slight overhang or lip. There also seemed to be very faint \u201ccircuit board\u201d type etches on the body of the object. These apparent etchings were more apparent in the center grove on the \u201cbelly\u201d of the triangle and within the groove or indentation along the sides. One witness later remarked that some of its features reminded him of a \u201cStar Destroyer\u201d space vehicle from the Star Wars movies.  After approximately 30 seconds of viewing the object, the driver became agitated and fearful, saying that they \u201chave to get out of here.\u201d He drove away and continued westbound on the avenue. When they left, the object left their point of view. But as they increased their distance at a block away, it came into view again in the back window, still fixated in the sky in the exact position last seen. Anyone else viewing the object might have passed and though nothing of it. It was so still and innocuous, that they probably would have thought it was part on the building complex. As the car passed over a hill a few blocks west of the object, it could not be seen any more. No other cars were observed on the road until about a half mile later.  The total experience was less than 5 minutes.  The three witnesses remained shaken for the rest of the night, with one of them insisting that it must be some sort of police helicopter performing a maneuver, and never wanting to talk about it again.  The most disturbing thing to the witness in the back seat was that even though he had been a big \u201cUFO buff\u201d from the time he was young, the word \u201cUFO\u201d or \u201calien\u201d never entered his mind until after the triangle was completely out of view. He even had other UFO related experiences before this, but still cannot explain why he wasn\u2019t \u201cfreaking out\u201d at the time. The best explanation was that \u201che was denying it in his mind to keep his body from freaking out.\u201d  The strangest element to the whole experience was the apparent personal awareness the object had to the witnesses. It got their attention by flashing, moved in and followed alongside the vehicle at a distance, changed forms, and seemed to wait for them and them only.

As I lay on the front of the boat looking at the fireworks I followed the smoke which was coming over the Marina.  I noticed a shiney object in the smoke almost directly above me it would appear then disappear in the thick blowing smoke, a couple of times I was able to see the entire bottom of the craft it was shaped like a teardrop all along the edge it looked like diamond cuts like you would see on jewelry.  At times I thought it had left but the smoke would clear alittle and there it would be again.  It stayed in the clouds of smoke as long as the fireworks continued.

The lighting did not continue across the sky, it went straight down after hitting this object.  the object looked to be a circular long object.  The object was a mile or two away at the point of impact.  It moved across the sky faster than a plane and as light as a feather.  It looked as though this object was slowly declining out of the sky.  It was a neon yellow glowing haze/aura/light after the lighting hit it.  It was just at the lower level of the cloud line(Few thousand feet).  As it passed directly over my head it made no sound at all.  At this point there was no thunder or rain to dampen the sound of a plane.  Several minutes after the object had passed a plane had flown by at a similar level and not directly over my head, and it made normal airplane noise.  The plane had several lights on it(like the F.A.A. requires), as the U.F.O. only had one light that glowed on and almost off but still bright enough to see.

They alternate colors, similar to the way a projector does, like at the movie theater. They are somewhat stationary, moving usually only in one direction (up) and very slowly. They are visible on clear nights. I have watched many airplanes fly around in the sky and also have watched many many stars. They are not either and that is what I am positive about. The difference between these and a twinkling star is drastic. I have not seen any other accounts of these things, so I'm guessing they are fairly new. They're so obvious that there should be others. I know that I am not the only one that has seen them. My significant other has seen them before too. Both times i have seen them there's one that is low and then two more adjacent to it higher up. The last time I watched them I could see more than three. They are odd and intriguing. What purpose do they serve.. they're not there for nothing. : (",

      "story": "Seen Three aliens three different times outside my window within 2 weeks I saw three translucent inter-dimensional beings out my window three times in 2 weeks   I was sitting on my recliner in my living room.  I was watching my Television and I noticed something in the trees.  I looked through my big glass window that looks onto the back of the apartment building. I saw three aliens or some kind of beings in my trees.  At least I thought they were in the trees. The tree line is about 10 feet my window.  They were about 4  feet off the ground. I was scared to death, I could not move, I just froze with fear.  There were three of them. They were sitting side by side. At least I think they were sitting, hard to tell because they were translucent. I could see right through them, seeing the leaves move behind them.  Like in the movie \u201cPredator\u201d they were kind of see through but the outline of them was visible. They were on a platform.  They had very long arms and the width of their bodies were about 6.  Their height was maybe 1 foot, hard to tell since I was not sure if they were sitting or standing.  This was about 10.am around the first week of July, of 2009 in Milwaukee Wisconsin.  I am in an apartment complex that is two stories\u2019 high and 10 apartments wide.  Mostly very nice Mexican people live here.  I am from Georgia.  I mention that in case this becomes significant since there are so many sightings of  UFO\u2019s in Mexico. In no way were these Grays aliens that people talk about.  The face was cone shaped. I could not really make out eyes or any features.  Obviously they were cloaked or thought they were invisible, I do not know.  They stared at me the whole time, never looking around, just right at me for about 4 minutes.   Finally I got the nerve to stand up slowly and make my way to the front door. I knew the window was open; I wanted to close it because I was afraid they would come in and abduct me. Or do experiments as we hear about what happens to people.  As I had my back to them for only a second, I turned to look back but they had gone. I then went too quickly to my neighbor\u2019s apartment. She asked me if I had seen a ghost. I said just something very weird. I would not tell her for being afraid of her thinking I was crazy. I was so afraid I told no body. Not even my boyfriend who was out of town for the next two weeks. I was there alone. I want to let you know. I am a 48 year old woman from Georgia. I do not do drugs, I do drink a beer here and there but I had not had any beer for about a week. I have never hallucinated or imagined anything in my whole life. I am not on any prescription drugs and have never been on them. I was really seeing this and wish I had never had. So when Mark came home from working in Canada I did not tell him even though I was still scared. A couple mornings after he was home he woke me to ask if I have ever seen anything weird out the back window.  I said yes, why are you asking me? He was scared, I could tell as he started to tell me that he saw three beings out the back window in the trees that he could see through. It was about 5:30 as we slept in the living room all night since it is cooler then than our bedroom. We have had placed our mattress on the floor near the front door. He said there were three of them side by side with cone faces, long arms and almost he could make out! eyes or holes where there would be eyes. He described them exactly as I had seen them and also they were on a platform. He said the platform was a milky color but still translucent. He could see the outline and see the leaves right through them. He said their heads were moving up and down, to the right to the left looking at the back of out apartment building. He was sure they did not see him since he was so far from the window near the front door on the mattress which is on the floor. When I am in my recliner I am only about 4 feet from the window. He said they were there for about 4 minutes also then they disappeared. When I asked him to point right where he saw them, it was interesting because they were on the right side of our window but when I saw them they were on the left side. Remember now both times were in the morning and same description. He said they were doing something with their hands, maybe working controls? I don\u2019t know, I am just scared out of my mind the! y will come back again. I was happy I could share this bizarre! happeni ng in out lives. So about two days after Mark had seen them I was in my recliner watching Television. It was around 9 a.m in the morning. I saw movement in the trees again and this time there was only one of the beings. I saw him for about only about 1 minute or minute and a half or so. This time he was in the middle of the window about the same height in the trees. His cone shaped face and long hanging arms, looking right at me. I was very scared and had a look of fear on my face. Mark was in the room and when he saw my face he saw I was scared but when he turned his head to look it disappeared. Now I have been analyzing this highly unusual event. I am scared all time. I am in fear they will take mark or myself to where to do what? Why appear behind an old run down apartment building in virtually the same place area in the trees? This has reoccurred three times in the morning hours. From about a minute and a half to about 4 minutes they stay to study mark or I? To take readings of the Earth, say maybe they are measuring the Earths magnetic field, gasses in atmosphere? Are they planning an attack on mankind? Do they want to become our friends? Learn our language? Are they just as curious about us as we are of them? Do they want to reproduce with our species? Do they want to use us as food? So many things run through our heads, WHY WHY HERE? Why not appear at the White House, a museum, a school, a park or in a science laboratory? Why behind an old apartment building at OUR WINDOW? Are the other people in the apartments seeing them also? I am not ready to ask around. I want to move out of here as quickly as I can but for financial reasons I don\u2019t see that happening anytime soon. Maybe they will never appear again and my nerves can calm down. \tMy girlfriend Mary is vey excited about this. She wants to see them very badly so she can take photos or video tape them to show the world. She says this is very important for the world to see that beings are showing up here repeatedly. She says they probably are not from another world but from another dimension. That maybe their laboratory in their dimension is situated right there at all times but the veil from our dimensions are opening up. They are not really in the trees at all but in their time and a different dimension. They could be opening and closing them. They are showing up as almost invisible, is that because they are scared that we will shoot them? They know enough that this is a common reaction among humans, Shoot first ask questions later. Do they even know we see them at all? Mary says we can roll up a ball of yarn with a long string on the end. When they appear throw it at them, it might go into their place and we might see just a string hanging in mid air! when they closed the veil. The yarn will not show harmful intent because we could put a note on it saying :Become our friends, Talk to us, we know your there. We could put a little present inside the ball of yarn.

It was a line of four balls of light.  The first three were white and the last one was red. They were moving across the sky in a southeast direction as I faced to the southwest. They were almost directly overhead at about a 75 degree angle.  They moved together as if connected as one craft and the balls of light were touching like this OOOO.  They didn't blink or anything, just moved in a straight line. I was about 10 at the time and was with my parents and their friends.

The Blue Angles were there on both Sat and Sun.  The next day, Sunday, My girlfriend I were at her Mothers house with the dogs in the front yard. Side note, I was a stinger missile gunner in the Army and ever since then, I have a habit of looking in the sky/air.  I was trained to look and observe and identify aircraft.  Since then, I tend to look upward often and try to challenge myself to identify aircraft whenever possible. This day however had a very high overcast.  I would guess 5-10 thousand feet.  We were  in her Mothers front yard playing with the dogs.  I happened to look up and noticed  a single sphere silhouetted against the backdrop of the overcast skyline.  I quickly called for my girlfriend to come over and see it as well.  As we stood there watching the ONE sphere/round object silhouette against the background of the overcast sky, suddenly a second sphere/round object appeared, then an other sphere/round object, then finally a fourth.   All were perfectly aligned and all where exact same size/symmetric.  Within less than one minute they suddenly simply streaked off or more accurately, just disappeared. This is what the looked like once all four came together: (although they almost perfectly blended in with the skyline/clouds).  I\u2019m simply trying to point out the symmetry and alignment of the way they appeared. Thank you,  US Citizen",

Because Milwaukee has laws about parking on certain sides of the street my mom asked me to go check on my brother's car. It was parked on the correct side of the street so I start walking back to the house. As I'm walking back I take a glance at the night sky, always a beautiful sight with the clouds illuminated by the stars and moon in my opinion. I saw something completely different though. About 200 feet up (from what I can estimate) a yellow circle appeared. It was somewhat fuzzy and opaque. When I say appear I mean it slowly materialized, at first, transparent, then getting more solid-like. It also seemed to be flat, so it wasn't a sphere, I don't think. From the middle of this yellow circle a small craft appeared. One moment there was just a yellow circle. The next, the craft was there. It was circle shaped since it was against the yellow circle I couldn't make out many details other than that it was dark in color. The yellow circle then began to fade again just as it had appeared. Growing more transparent aside from more solid. As the yellow circle was fading the small craft began lighting up. I didn't have my glasses so I can only surmise at a few lights that lit up along it. The craft then accelerated suddenly and flew south. It made no noise to accelerate and no noise while in flight. Also, no visible means of flying (no engine exhaust, etc).

I was driving past the Marquette University campus, when I noticed a very bright light shining in the still dark sky at about 30 degrees to my left and up slightly. I immediately thought it was an airplane approaching.  I continued to watch it, thinking, \u201cWow, what a bright light.\u201d  I really was brighter than any plane light I have ever seen.  It was only one color (a yellowish white, not a bluish white).  It was then I thought why is there no flashing?   The light stayed solid the whole time. Then as I kept watching, I waited to see if it would change or get closer or keep going to the side so I could see what sort of plane it was.  But, I was amazed to notice that it never moved. That really startled me, so I really now strained to keep an eye on it for about 30 more seconds\u2026no movement.  As I was driving on the freeway, I had to occasionally divert my eyes back to the road, and at that point I did once again, but when I looked back, the light was gone.  I slowed the car down and scanned the whole sky out my left window.  No lights.  There was nothing at all in the sky. Also, the weather was completely clear.",

      "story": "Very large, bright moving searchlight, but no plane or helicopter in sight to be making it. My grandfather and I were flying on a plane from Milwaukee and stopping in Atlanta, GA, from there to go to Cancun and on to Cozumel.  It was about 6:30 in the morning, and we had just taken off.  The sky was dark and clear with very few clouds, and it was my second time on an airliner so I was looking out through the window.  As we were passing over a town outside of milwaukee, I noticed a large spotlight passing over a few neighborhoods.  The yards and streets that it passed over were brightly illuminated.  You could see the grass in the fields and chimneys on the rooftops and such as they were being lit up as the light was passing, and you could see the outline of the light.  I looked to see a helicopter or even a plane generating the light but I could not find one.  I told my grandpa to look over and check it out and he said he didn't know what it was either.  I was tempted to ask a flight attendant but noticed they were pretty busy, so I just let it go.  The moon was out and full, but i've never heard of the moon creating such a focused, concentrated light of which I saw. I followed the light up and you could see the light was in a conic, searchlight projection, but nowhere was there anything to be making it.  No tower, plane, or helicopter.  The light seemed to be shining down from about 1-2 hundred feet up.   I followed the light for a good 2-3 minutes and then it dissapeared.  It was sort of making the same path as the plane, except that it had more of a wavy pattern slowly angling away from the plane and it moved very quickly. It came back into sight again shortly after and then it just vanished, like if someone just flipped off the switch.   I don't know if anybody else had seen it, but it was clearly something strange.  If it were being emitted from some sort of aircraft, the plane had amazing stealth technology because the only thing seen was its searchlight.

      "story": "Large top shaped UFO over Lake Michigan leaves 3 witnesses with  possible coverup or were cops really aliens ? I submit to you , whoever you guys really are this report of what I have witnessed. This event was real and I was with my girlfriend at the time and another friend . So the 3 of us were there and we all saw the same thing .. and honestly it was very disturbing. This event was on the banks of lake Michigan right there a few feet down the trail that leads off to the south of the lake front park in Millwaukee Wi. . It has been quite a while since and Im not really sure of the exact date but i think maybe Aug. or Sept 1999 I could ask the other friends of mine and maybe get a more exact date . Anyway I thought I should tell about this because I think we need to know more and maybe this account along with others that come forward will hopefully someday help to prove that these things are real. Well here ya go , I just thought one nite it might be fun to go down to the park. I liked to go down by he lake . It was a place I could kinda go and think and anyway we went down there . It was getting dark and I started walking down a trail .. that was really private property and we shouldnt have been down there after dark anyway .. but we were just talking and throwing rocks. thats when I noticed what I thought was a falling star streak across the sky in the east way off far away in the sky . as I saw that I said to the others , \" hey check this out look in the sky \" and thats when things became very strange.The light Id seen streak across the sky actually stopped and went back in the opposite direction. It was fast like a streak and stopped on a dot then after stopping a second. jolted again back across what Id say whatever 8 inches in the sky from that distance .. and it looked just as bright and as far off as a star..  The original distance that it was is hard for me to try and explain but I say , it was way the hell out there in space. So at that point we were all focused on this little light that seemed to zip and stop and zip and stop and as we were watching it , it became obvious that it was coming straight in a line for us .. I mean it was only like a minute from when we first noticed it to where this thing was right up in our faces ... It was there hovering like maybe 20 feet above the lake and like as close as if it was the house across the street .. This thing was huge it was like rounded and TOP shaped not a sharp edged upside down triangle but more smooth like an old style Top.. like the spin toy for kids .. but this thing was as big as like a couple of houses .. and there wasnt really a sound ,more like a hum a vibration that you could feel . And all along the top edge were like 5 or so rows of lights and these lights were very bright .Red,blue,yellow, and an eerie white like similar to those high pressure sodium lights, in that they seemed to pulse and surge and there were also lights all over the thing from the top to the bottom that pulsed and so forth .AS I looked at my friends on either side of me and said are you guys seeing this .. we were all just frozen our jaws fucking dropped to the ground .. I couldnt believe it . So we stood in awe there for about 2 or 3 minutes and watched this thing and then a very intense sharp light started moving and as it did it was like a beam and the thing shined right into my eyes. and immediatly I cover my face with my hands and thats when I got really scarred . I thought at that point this had begun to get a little bit to close and it sunk in that this might not be all fun and games .. honest I said ok guys fuck this shit I've seen enough Im getting the fuck out of here everybody for themselves ..I felt panic for real .. when that light shined on me I felt it was reading my mind and I didnt like it .. so I was looking around for an escape route should I go this way or that way .. we saw a light comming up the trail we came in on .. thats when I said ohh shit they are comming for us .. so as that light comming up the trail got our attention just as we were gonna take off up the side of the banks .Guess what it was ? a police officer .. he's like \"hey you guys \" what are doing ... and with his flashlight in our faces we say just out here looking at this UFO .. and he takes the flashlight and shines it out over the lake where all the sudden its pitch black and the thing is gone .. just \"poof \"gone and says, \"what ufo\". Man I dont know what the hell was going on but it seemed ass if he was in on it or something was deffinatly weird about not only the UFO but the cop as well .. anyway after running all our Ids and trying to mess with us about being where we shouldnt be and private property and so forth .. he let us go and we got the hell out of there .. So, thats the story .. this was the real deal and you guys want to know more I would love to tell ya .. I wish I knew what they wanted but I have a strange feeling that they were going to do something bad to me .. I have nightmares about it still .. who knows, It was just a total trip.. well also the 3 of us we just would look at each other and just shake our heads ,, Ive told friends of mine about this and I think they probably say Im crazy .. or just telling a story .. but this was no ((deleted--B.S..)).

      "story": "3 disk shaped lights swerving among each other across sky, got to North, shot straight into the stars Myself, my brother, and a neighborhood friend of ours were in our backyard looking at the stars with one of those old Gilbert cardboard tube reflector telescopes.  I actually did an ink drawing of the event and submitted it to Coast to Coast\u2019s website, which they posted.  My brother is three years younger than I.  When we saw this I must have been around ten.  I don\u2019t know if he would fill out a form like this.  I\u2019d really like to know his blow by blow recollection.  What\u2019s funny is that when I got onto Facebook, before that we hadn't talked to each other in almost twenty years (for whatever reason).  We got all caught up in two days (score one for Facebook).  One of the first things I asked him was if he remembered the night in the backyard when we saw the three UFOs?  I may have been living with an hallucination my whole life.  He told me \u2013 Yeah, he remembered it and he thinks about it all the time.  That night has convinced me there is something going on.! I\u2019ve been pro-space and a Trekkie (to a point) my entire life.  I\u2019m now 62 and actually I have been diagnosed with MDS which has really taken me out of the game, it\u2019s a pre-leukemia, may need a bone marrow transplant.  I have a younger brother that already said he would do it if it came to it. Being that my mortality is staring me in the face, I feel like I have to get all this stuff in me \u2013 out of me, before I won\u2019t be able to any longer.  I just heard the program on Coast to Coast tonight where you asked to send all this stuff in.  Here\u2019s my two-cents. My Uncle gave me the telescope for my birthday.  It was in November and a cold clear night, but ya gotta try it out.  We took turns looking through it, and I\u2019m sure we saw nothing we could comprehend.  What happened: is that we heard a noise like the sound of a jet aircraft, but we couldn\u2019t see it yet.  We knew it was coming from the East which were houses and trees.  I had an idea to maybe see if I can see the jet in the telescope, close up. What came over the tops of the trees however, where these three classic disks.  They glowed enough that they were obvious.  At arm\u2019s length, maybe the size of a silver dollar between finger and thumb.  What I\u2019ll never forget (if that wasn\u2019t enough), was that they were swerving in and out of each other; like playing, easy as you please, absolutely in control, dancing around each other.  They came over the trees,  came across the sky (clear-starry), maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon line, which we could not see for the neighborhood houses and trees.  They went across the sky, swerving in and out of each other, go to about where North is and shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.  We forgot about the damn telescope, we were too dumfounded.  I remember running into the house to tell my mother (who was watching television) that we just saw flying saucers in the backyard.  She straight out didn\u2019t believe us.  Why should she?  Not the same night, and I know I was still a kid.  My mother sat under the street light on our front porch, waiting for my father to come home (he worked late as a chef in a restaurant).  This could have been 1 am.  She was alone (yes under a street light at night, dark streets, in inner town Milwaukee \u2013 those days are long gone).  Anyway, she swears she heard the sound of a freight train, come from the East going to the West and it was in the sky over the top of houses in the neighborhood.  She curled up to protect herself \u2013 I cannot recollect if the same instance is when she said she saw something that was \"cigar\"-shaped.  After it was gone (the noise) she said she saw a smoke trail, extend from the East to the West, being blown South from a wind from the North.  It was low enough for the street lights to reflect off it.  I can\u2019t recall where I heard about-shaped UFOs that sounded like a locomotive?   You\u2019re preaching to the choir.",

      "story": "Silent group of 12-15 glowing orange orbs of light appear one at a time over horizon and flying in a spread out cluster NW to SWW I was sitting at a bus stop across from a Domino's waiting 15 minutes for my Pizza playing Angry Birds on my cell phone. I put the cell away and was just about to cross back over the street to pick up my Pizza when out from behind a cloud to my right I suddenly saw a bright orange burst of light that was so bright it could not be ignored. One orange burning/glowing ball light in the night sky is one thing, but suddenly I saw another, and yet another trailing behind it. I could not believe what I was seeing and before I knew it on the horizon I was seeing them pop up to the North & just West and follow a similar path NW to SW almost as if in a non-linear string formation.  During this time I called my girlfriend who was at our house 6 blocks away and yelled at her to go outside and look up while I frantically tried to snap photographs on my cellphone to no avail due to the overbearing light from street lamps. When I first saw them I thought it could be a meteor, but after the first two and then seeing how fluidly they were moving, with small adjustments in elevation I knew they couldn't be as it wasn't burning up or crashing or dissapating.   Then I thought could be a helicopter, but they were SO bright and 100% SILENT & did not move like helicopters. There were planes in the sky as well during and after the sighting (Milwaukee County Airport traffic) but these lights neither came from the Airport nor headed toward the airport and were way too bright and obvious to be planes or anything else that uses the Airport Terminals. I stayed on the phone with my girlfriend until I had walked the 6 blocks home and by the time I had gotten there all the remaining UFOs were gone, however she had seen them as well, albeit not as many - she ended up seeing 5-7 & even noted that one seemed to turn it's light off and she got sight of the actual shape of the object as seen on the face of a cloud, which was round / spherical - as she put it &quot;a! lmost 2 spheres in one&quot;. I only lost sight of the remaini! ng 3 &qu ot;fireball&quot; orbs that I could still see from my perspective once I got about 2 blocks from home and they seemed to have changed direction and were all now traveling more decidedly west than Southwest, however still had a slightly southern trajectory as well. When the sighting was said and done I had seen a &quot;fleet&quot; of these lights - about 12-15 very strong & bright glowing orange orbs moving across the Milwaukee night sky over Milwaukee's East Side near the University of Milwaukee Wisconsin. I lost sight of the remaining objects the same way I lost sight of the first 8 or 9... as they flew south past my point of view, they headed hard west & disappeared into cloud cover at this point. You could see them climbing up into the clouds quickly once they reached them and fading out of view in less than a minute. These objects were completely silent, very bright, seemingly moving as a large group / unit but with their own variances & at least 5-10 orb lengths between! each object. I felt calm, dumbfounded and not really frantic quite frankly but rather at ease. I remember that my only concern was that my girlfriend who was only a few blocks away get outside and confirm what I was seeing from that perspective as well (looking south as I was seeing them come from the north), so I was ecstatic when she answered and when I heard her reaction over the phone when she looked up. I had a feeling in my chest, slightly emotional and my eyes were wired open as well as a feeling of calm.

It was sort of dark outside and there were a few clouds out this night. So while walking past the library they just closed I told my guy lets go back real fast. We went back towards the library parking lot looking northbound and up in the sky was about 6-8 bright orange fireball looking objects forming into a cicle. So we were under a tree and decided to go into the parking lot to get a better view.  What we seen next left us speechless. A few of the objects started to disappear while they were forming into a line that was like waving like a snake. At this moment I counted 4 objects just sitting there waving in the air. Then suddenly one more disappears and theres 3 left. These 3, still in a line formation, started to form a triangle that was rotating counterclockwise. The entire time we were watching these lights they were blinking from dull to bright.  We decided to try and go north to see if it was just someone floating somethng in the air. We cut through the parking lot and next to it was an alley but at the beginning of the alley theres a huge house with big trees there. While were walking the object starts to proceed northbound but at a slow rate of speed and then we lose sight behind the tree. I continue down the alley a couple steps as my guy stops and I see the bright light but this time theres only 1 and its starting to gain a little speed as I was following it. Then i just decided to stop and go back home. I had my phone with me but couldn't take a video because I was to shocked at what was happening in the sky for those 10 or 15 minutes.",

      "story": "Strange lights, stranger shapes, and a strange ending. It was a cold late fall day.  Myself and 3 friends were along with me when we decided to go to the lake front (Lake Michigan). The 4 of us were strolling casually along the coast that evening.  As we progressed further down a lake front pier we collectively noticed an unusually bright.  Since the lake front is closed after 10pm and it was now around 1am our first thought is it being some form of authority,  police, coast gaurd etc. We soon realized that was not the case.  All of us agreed that this exceptional light was moving our direction(west) from the east.  East of us was Lake Michigan.  So our thought is still optimistic, that being, as if it were a boat or some other everyday regularity.  We all can not let this light go, we continue to stare in its direction. Within about a minute, the light gained significant ground growing closer in distance to us.  At this time we were able to tell that this light was not on the water but, in the air.  It took a moment to take its airborne presence in. 1. because from this location on the lake we frequently seen air craft heading south toward Mitchell International airport and 2. because of the low level and quietness. Another sign that allowed us to realize that this was airborne was in its approach toward us it passed over the rock walls which I believe is for a wave/wake break for sailors and ships. At my estimate the rock walls are about 300 yards from shore and about 150 yards from our position on the pier. So, this quite airborne light is about 100 yards out from us and its light becomes much more intense.   With it becoming more clear that the light is attached to something greater behind it 2 of my friends become hysterical and begin to cry and emotions become rather powerful and overwhelming. I have stood my ground thus far when the light begings to angle itself toward the ground/water.  It is at about a 45\u00b0 angle(the light) and close enough for me to be able to reach it with a stone or tennis ball toss.  The brilliant light is seemingly piercing the filthy water in this area to a depth of about 6ft. and approaching the tips of my toes. The light comes to about an inch before my toes and turns its &quot;high beem&quot; off.  Within a matter of 10 seconds the ship accelerated and was out of view. While taking in all of what had just happened and calming down we begin to notice a set of lights following the same path coming towards us again. This time,  I reach for my phone and begin to use my camara.  That craft is still well out above the water but I start to take pictures anyway to try to gather as much as I can. The flash may have caught the attention of the craft because as I clicked more pictures and more flashes it seemed to quicken its pace in our direction. As this craft got closer it became clear it was not the same one in which we had just seen because this one was easily 10x as large with a set of lights across the bottom(yellow/whiteish)  and 3 larger lights on top(red/green/red) that appeared to be incased in glass or another see-through material. I would guess its length to be around 200ft. This craft slowly pan across our view at about 60ft out and 60ft up.  It was the most strange structure.  It looked as if it were made of old oil barrels and not in a slick uniform shape,  more jagged and off balance.  It had unique looking hieroglyphs written on the barrells. The hieroglyphic text did not show up in any of the photos.  All together I took around 110 photos which i shared with people.  I e-mailed a few photos to one of my co witnesses which I believe she still possess today.  Within 24 hours all 110 photos were erased/disappeard from my phone....not one of my other personal photos of friends and the such were missing from my phones photo gallery.  Olny the ones I took that night. We were just 4 friends in our early 20s....no professional background. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Object was hovering over 500 feet off ground, had no wings, no tail, fire coming from bottom, and certainly intelligently controlled. I was watching the basketball game in the kitchen when I got a call that I wanted to take privately, so I stepped out of the side door of the house.  As I was in a heated debate on the phone, I looked up and noticed something in the distance above the treeline. I stared at it, and as I did so, short bursts of flame began to come from the bottom of the object.  The flame would switch from left to right as the object wobbled a bit; as if it was trying to maintain balance.  That's when I yelled to my girlfriend to &quot;go get my camera&quot;. She did, but it took at LEAST 40 seconds for her to do so. As I continued to stare at the object, waiting for my camera,  I noticed that the flame at the bottom of the object began to lose it's intensity.  As the flame went from a full flame to just a red glow, I noticed that the object was slowly losing altitude, and drifting slowly south east, toward Lake Michigan.   As it dropped below the treeline, I began to run out of the ! yard and down the street so I can see around that particular treeline. I could, and again, I could see the object. The red glow at the bottom of the object was barely noticeable at this point, and the object began to descend more straight down than southeast and down as it was before.  It began to lose altitude faster, until it went below the treeline at that location, which was approximately half a city block to the south of where I was when I first began to record.  I waited at this location for about 30 minutes for the object to ascend or reapear, but it never did. While I was recording, I was not looking at the viewfinder; I was just pointing the lens in the direction of the object, so I had no idea if I actually had what I was seeing on the camcorder.  But after a discussion with neighbors and others who were present, I went inside, connected the camcorder to the television, and began to view the footage. I've been from that point on, compelled to find out what I saw is.  I contacted the local police, military, FAA, News Stations, etc., trying to find out if they had anything on the radar at that time and area of that day, but.....nothing; even though I expressed to them all that I had this thing on video!!  This incident has not only caused me a great deal of concern, it has changed my life, and challenges many things I believe. I have always been open to the possibility of the existence of such things, but never saw anything that came anywhere near actually convincing me that they are real. All that has changed now though. That thing had no sound whatsoever, it had no wings, and it had no tail end. It looked almost like a giant church bell with a flame at the bottom. Had I not recorded what I was seeing, I would have long since just assumed it was something normal, that can be explained. But after viewing this thing in slow motion on zoom, I am convinced that it is not, and can not. I will be attaching a copy of my video with this report (If it will upload). My animus is to have an expert opinion of what it is! that is on my video. it was certainly intelligently operated, and it was definitely a mechanical craft of some sort, and not a balloon or anything like that. I for some reason had a feeling of desperation as this thing was descending. It is the same desperate feeling I felt that made me look in that direction and up in the first place when I first noticed the object. I'm left feeling as though whatever it was, it was losing power, running out of fuel, or something to that effect, because it seemed to be struggling to maintain it's altitude. It was a struggle that It evidently lost. The object was moving slowly in the direction of the Lake; which leads me to believe that it was attempting to get out over open water. In  fact, it seemed to be trying very diligently to do so. I have no idea if it landed in the water or over land. All I know is it landed or crashed somewhere slightly south east of where I was, and never came back up. After you review my video, please get back ! to me and let me know what you think. Thank you; verily.",

My friend, who doesn\u2019t believe in UFO\u2019s, had gone out to her car and saw 3 orange lights flying in the sky.  The lights appear white on the video, and are actually closer than it seems.  They moved in a westerly direction, without sound, and then just disappeared. They fly above her about half way through the video. She doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve\u201d in UFO\u2019s, but was wondering if there is a logical explanation for these 3 separate orange glowing orbs to have been in the sky at this time.",

      "story": "Craft with white and red lights hovering and slowly moving SE from Froedert Hospital past State Fair Park Traveling west on I-94 from Milwaukee around 9pm, I was on my way to pick up a friend when, nearing Miller Park, I noticed an aircraft hovering above the area around Froedert Hospital.  With two bright white lights connected by smaller red and white blinking lights, I thought it was an airplane at first, except it remained almost completely stationary.  Maybe it was a helicopter, I thought, as I continued on my way to my friend's place, losing sight of it. About 15 minutes later at around 9:15pm, my friend and I were getting back onto I-94 westbound near Miller Park when I spotted the same lights.  By this time, the object had moved and was presently just south of I-94 by about a quarter to a half mile, hovering about 1000 feet above the ground.  As we got closer, we were able to get a better view of it as it hovered above the area just east of Stare Fair Park. There were no discernible wings and it wasn't a helicopter.  There were at least 3 bright white lights and a hale-domed shaped blinking red light which appeared to be in the center.  I couldn't determine the shape-it was night and we were on the freeway, driving fast-but my friend and I both did not recognize it as any aircraft we're familiar with.  If anyone else happened to see the same thing, please post.",

It was still very light outside even though the sun just started to set.  I was on my way to my grandmothers apartment same as I do almost every week to help her out with sme household stuff and just to talk and visit.  Normally I would have used public transportation to get there completely however due to construction I had to walk the last had mile there.  Her apartment building is right across from Lake Michigan, I don't feel comfortable being anymore specific.  As I was walking down the street I looked out over the lake like usual to enjoy the view.  As I was looking I noticed as usual some planes going over.  Then, I saw this white object very close to the moon.  It drew my attention because it made no sound and had no exhaust trail behind it.  As I began to look closer I noticed it had no wings, or appeared not too.  This made me think it was one of those new \"drones\" police departments are using to monitor their districts.  So, I wanted to get a better look.  I hurried across the street to get a better view.  When I did I saw another pitch white cylinder shaped object also close to the moon moving in the sky.  I felt mesmerized.  I couldn't stop staring.  Once I saw th both I knew they were drones or planes or anything I've ever seen.  I couldn't look away.  I heard cars driving by past me but everything felt like it slowed down.  I experience a surge of fear and adrenaline.  I stared at them moving slowly towards each other.  The moon seemed to be in the middle point between them.  When they got close to the moon they just disappeared.  I was staring right at them and instantly, they were just gone.  I was in disbelief.  I ran back and forth, looking all around trying to see where they could have gone.  I couldn't see them anywhere.  I felt, strange.  I have no idea how to describe it.  After that I just sat on a bench and stared out onto the lake and the sky hoping they'd come back for about 20 minutes but they never did.  I know that what I saw had to be a UFO.",

There were a few low lying clouds passing through the area.  I had been pointing a professional strenght laser around the sky at the cloud bottoms.  I looked down to see what my dog was getting herself into and retrained my eyes on the laser pointer.  When I looked up I noticed a very bright light directly next to the laser pointer.  I immediately shut the pointer off thinking it was a plane.  The bright light started to strobe extremly slowly and out of any rhythm.  I've seen before.  The light was just at cloud level and moving much too slow to be a aircraft.   Each time the light got brighter it seemed to become more intense.  The light had gotten so bright it started to feel like it was burning my skin.   After going inside my home I noticed my skin was slightly orange.  The light was strong enough to shine on the pavement around me.  The light moved behind a cloud rather fast and did not return after the cloud had past.  I stayed in the area for several minutes to see if it would come back.  It did not return.",

There was an incredible white light that resembled a hand-fan that was opening and then quickly and violently collapsed.  The light did not brighten the sky as a whole, just a remote area that was about double the size of a typical full moon.  I would guess I witnessed the light at about 35* above the western horizon and my best estimate for direction would be a straight line from about the Hoan bridge towards Potawatomi Casino.   The occurrence lasting about a second, left me humbled and dumbfounded.  I have since been feverishly trying to identify an explanation for the event, but nothing I have found with internet searches or recall from a college-level introduction astronomy course I took years back have helped me make any sense of the incident.   The light collapsing on itself reminded me of television depictions of travel between dimensions I suppose.  I cannot say that there isn\u2019t a natural explanation, but it did appear that the light was flat on the bottom (and rounded on the top as it \u201cfanned-out\u201d).   Whatever it was that I saw has left quite an impression on me, and I\u2019m certain the awesomeness cannot be fully explained with words.",

We wondered what we had seen, and then he said, \u201cLook, there\u2019s another.\u201d  As another appeared on the horizon, soon there were 2 more.  That group of 3 spheres, or orbs, same color, moved the same general direction, quietly, again in unison and moved behind the same tall building til we could not see them.   Again the sky was dark and we watched as slowly a group of 5 more appeared, moving the same general direction, slowing, as if in unison.   Last, 2 more appeared and did the same thing, always moving slowing, ea! st to west, but disappearing. I got a few photos.   I\u2019m very aware of the night sky, and my surroundings and have never seen anything like this; neither had the musician who watched as long as I did, a total time of about 15 minutes.

There was a very bright object in the sky, with long very bright tail (kind of what what Hollywood would portray as a meteor or a comet....or even some rocket/missle) that was traveling in a downward trajectory.   Some random stranger was walking next to me and I said do you see that!  Unfortunately, they were too busy looking at their phone, and by the time I got their attention, it was gone.  I can tell you with 100% confidence that was no way a shooting star or a plane.  It was way too big to be a shooting star and way too bright and fast to be a plane.",

      "story": "Given that local weather forecasts mentioned that the Aurora Borealis could be viewed in my area from around 10 PM, I went outside to see if they were, indeed, visible in Milwaukee.  Unfortunately, they weren't. However, while scanning the night sky around 9:45 PM, I noticed a light directly overhead.  At first, I thought it was a satellite moving quietly, steadily due north.  But then I saw it was blinking on-and-off in one second intervals.  No navigation lights were evident, and the light was not the strobe of a high-flying aircraft.  In fact, two such high-flying jets (headed west) crossed well in front of this object, so it was easy to discern and compare what a strobe looked like at altitude vis-a-vis the unknown object. In terms of illumination, the object/light resembled Saturn in both brightness and magnitude, although the quality of its light was a steady pale white while lit.  There light definitely wasn't a flash like that of a strobe, and it wasn't like the brilliant reflected light of a planet like Jupiter or Saturn.  It had no star-like characteristics, either. Unlike transient satellite flashes, the pulsing remained constant throughout the sighting.  And, unlike a satellite, the object appeared to stop about 30 degrees above the horizon for 15-20 seconds, before heading off in a more northwest direction (a deviation under 10 degrees).  It pulsed steadily until it disappeared from view.  No navigation lights were ever in evidence; no contrail; no sound; no silhouette visible against the sky. The sighting lasted about five minutes.

As I was going out on Saturday, 10/27/2012, sometime between 9-10 pm, to see a band in Milwaukee, WI, on  Halloween (also Sandy storm) weekend, I noticed a large cigar shaped illuminated cylinder, floating very high up, going west to east directly above my house located a few miles north of I-94, 5 miles west of downtown.  The diameter to length ratio was about 1:8. It was misty, with clouds, yet I could see the object fairly well, traveling similar or slower than a typical aircraft. While mainly cylindrical, it seemed to have a flat bottom, was glowing, but most distinctly had a white light on the side about a third of the way back, and overall seemed brighter near the rear.  A friend in the Kickapoo Valley in SW Wisconsin, also mentioned seeing the same craft earlier that night traveling west to east. Ironically, earlier that day, I dropped off information of my first UFO sighting in the NY Hudson Valley in 1985 (could not recall the specific date, but was mild day in the spring, summer or early fall before dusk) to a local Milwaukee MUFON contact.  He provided me two forms in 2008, and I finally wanted to get them back to him.  I am not sure if he believed my sighting of the saucer shaped UFO, and/or actually processed the information I provided.  While searching online, I found a website describing a similar situation that may have been the person that I met during my siting, who drove up in a maroon van, from the east and turned south onto the road in front of my house, who said he had been tracking same craft for 40 minutes. Additionally, I saw online that similar Cigar shaped sightings happened a week before on Oct 15, 2012,  in Huntsville, AL, and TN, Oct 16 in Pike, Kentucky, during the day,  ((Male's name deleted)) photographed a translucent cylinder, with two lights on side a third of the way back, using a camera on a telescope, Oct 17 in Virginia, and Oct 18 in Gardiner, NY, equal distance apart over the 4 day time span. Also, a few years later, I was on the Coast to Coast radio show and spoke with guest John Lear.
