It was moving fast like a jet and made no sound.  It had no wings, no windows, and it was shiny. It was flying low enough for me to get a good look at it to tell it was not an airplane or a toy of some sort.  I watched it fly for about 10 seconds until it was too far for me to see it.   I'm not sure when the date was, but it was a while ago.  I was in my early 20's,  I am 36 now.  I still remember that day because as I was watching it, I made sure not to forget about it.  It was a cool experience because I could not understand why it made no sound or had no wings and appeared to be just floating through the sky.  About a week later I was walking outside, I don't remember where to, and a jet was flying by in the same direction at about the same speed as the saucer was.  It was clearly a jet of some sort and loud as jets usually are (the sound was foll! owing the jet).  That's all I remember and I haven't seen anything like it since.",

      "story": "Childhood sighting of disk witnessed by mother and sons. This story was related to me by my first cousins once removed at my great-aunt's (their mother's) funeral.  It occurred during their childhood in rural Neshoba County, Mississippi.  Both are Air Force veterans and solid citizens.  I have absolutely no reason to doubt their word.  According to the observers (who are twin boys), they were about seven or eight years old, and out of school for the summer.  The rural mail carrier delivered the mail to their home somewhat near the end of his route, and usually arrived after 3:00 p.m.  Their home was located approximately 100 yards up a gravel driveway from the main roadway, also a gravel road at the time.  The twins heard the mailman approach the mailbox, stop, and then accelerate off to the next home down the road.  They asked their mother if they could go down to the mailbox and get the mail.  She allowed them to go.  They walked the 100 yards or so down to the mailbox, retrieved the mail and headed back towards the house.  When they were approximately half way up the drive (50 yards from their home), my great-aunt began yelling for them to \"run, run!\" in an urgent tone.  They ran towards her.  When they arrived at the front porch of their home, my great-aunt pointed towards the woodline on the other side of a field approximately 4-500 yards from their home.  Silently hovering over the woodline was a very large silvery disk, perhaps 100-200 feet or larger in circumference.  They observed the disk hover for approximately another four or five minutes.  It then took off at a very high rate of speed, accelerating as it gained in altitude.  It was out of sight in only a few seconds, and was entirely silent. My cousins told me that they were in awe of the object but, being children, they quickly resumed playing and had only the vaguest memory of both the object and the event for many years.  While reminiscing at a Thanksgiving dinner many years later (in the mid-1990s), my great-aunt questioned them both to see if they remembered the event.  They both recalled the event and had virtually identical recollections.   An older brother who was a test engineer at the Nevada Test Site until his retirement also recalled that the story was related to him shortly after it happened in the early 1950s. I am not aware of any other witnesses, nor am I aware of any graphic images such as photos, movies, etc., that exist of the incident.  If you need further details, feel free to contact me.

I didn't try to take a picture because I thought that if I would go for the camera I was going to lose sight of it, but I did got a very dam good look at it from all angles and saw every little detail of the craft, I did a rough drawing of the craft on my pc just to give an idea of what I saw.

It sounds like nothing I have ever heard before, almost like a low pitch storm warning sound. It is coming from the woods which are pretty much desolate and vast. I called 911, and the operator told me a few officers reported hearing it, but none of them knew what it was. None of our neighbors could figure out what it was. I am a cement mason, and I am famaliar with the sounds of different machines, and the sound is neither machine nor human. It happens at random times throughout the day but at nighttime it gets real eerie and loud. The other night I came home at 4am and it sounded like it was above my roof at my house. I was seconds away from calling the cops. I do not know what is back there, but to my understanding if it is not human or machine, it just might be E.T.. or Jesus???",

      "story": "May/2006 - Video: UFO Over Philadelphia? I spent the weekend in New Jersey and on Sunday, my father gave me a ride back to Philadelphia.  I drove, and he asked if I could stop down in Chinatown so he could pick up some tea and some new teacups.  I took 95-N and got off at the Washington Ave exit, and proceeded up Washington Ave to 7th St. A few blocks before I turned onto 7th, I was looking up at the clouds when I saw something just kind of sitting there in the clouds that I could not identify.  When we turned south on 7th St., we pulled into a parking lot just off the intersection and across from Pho Ha where my father wanted to stop. I decided to hop out and use the DV camcorder my folks bought for my girlfriend and I back in Novemember when our son was born, and started recording.  The quality is not the best, and there's a Vietnamese band playing in the background in part of the footage but take a look. It's clearly not an airplane or a helicopter.  Around 2:38, I zoom all the way out to show just how far away this thing is, and based on that (which you'll see), I don't feel confident that it's a balloon as from that distance, even with my good eyesight, I don't think I would have seen a regular balloon flying that high, that far away, with the late afternoon sun kind of in my eyes otherwise.  So by definition, it's a UFO. What exactly it is, I don't know but enjoy, let others know for enjoyment if you want, and leave some comments if you want.  I wrote about it on my website here - (http://phillybits.blogspot.com/2006/05/ufo-sighting-over-philadelphia.html)  Video can be seen here - (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKEk5nu00lQ)",

When she got home several moments later she came out on our deck & asked me if the Police Helicopter was hovering in the area scoping out the park & I said about 45 minutes ago, but not lately.

My wife and I were walking near the intersection of Second and Bainbridge streets in Philadelphia on a clear, cloudless late afternoon when I noticed a very dense and unusual contrail appearing above buildings to the SE, moving on a heading more or less parallel to the Delaware River, which runs ~SSW to NNE at that point.   The contrail seemed much wider and denser than a normal contrail, and had no gap in the center as is typical of normal airliner trails.  It was moving at about the normal speed of a high-altitude jet or perhaps somewhat faster, and seemed to be at the height of a normal jet at cruising altitude, but possibly higher - very hard to tell with no reference points.   At the head of the trail was a small but very obvious fiery reddish ball.  It may have been the reflection of the late-afternoon sun on a plane, but I've seen many, many airliners under these conditions and this looked different.  It twinkled and at no time did it appear to change intensity.  Usually a strong sun glint on an airliner will vary as the reflection angle changed, but this didn't.  It looked exactly like a giant reddish road flare making a dense smoke trail heading more or less toward northern New Jersey.   I say giant because of the size of the trail.  It is impossible to estimate the size of the object but it appeared comparable to the size of Venus or Saturn when they're at their largest and most visible.  A twinkling, starlike reddish road flare with an immense and persistent white smoke trail.  It was unusual enough that we stopped to watch it until it disappeared behind buildings.  It didn't change speed, heading, altitude or intensity, and the motion was very steady.  The smoke trail remained for at least several minutes.  My thought at the time was that it was a reentry of some satellite, or an unusual meteor.   I recall that there were some unusual meteor incidents in the time frame, but this was not the same as this one, for example: http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/07/23/flash.boom/index.html http://www.meteorobs.org/maillist/msg22061.html  It was shortly before 9/11, if I recall correctly. There were no other contrails visible at the time, by the way. This was the most obvious thing in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

This was relayed to me, today, by my brother, who lives a couple of miles from the Phila Intn. Airport.  During the sighting, air traffic seem to  cease. He said the objects, triangle shaped,  seem to circle one another and had pulsing lights. There was no sound. They finally got a camera (evidently a small one and took a short video) I viewed the video on Youtube and it is not very good. He did say that his daughter then took a still photo with the flash on and that one of the objects flashed back. My brother, has lived in this house, near the airport, since his birth and stated that these were not any aircraft he had seen before, except for a similar sighting a year or two ago. He did call some of the local news stations. If you want to talk to my brother or one of the other witnesses, please email me, and I will forward your request.

VERY STRANGE.my body had a feeling of extreme pressure in my chest as well. the lights were dim as if only emitting 50 watts and were like a yellow/orange with a pulsating look. i have never seen anything quite like this before. the odd part at the end of the sighting was both objects seem to have colided with each other to become one and then took off at the most incredable speed in one direction, only to stop after reaching a distance of about 200 feet and then coming back as if to get another look at us and then vanished.",

      "story": "It was a strange light that was followed by a mysterious noise. On January 7th 2009 at approximately 12:45 A.M. (Eastern Standard Time) I was sitting in my bedroom at my computer desk working on a music project.  There is a window about 2 feet to the left side of my desk which I tend to glance out occasionally.   When I looked out the window I saw a flash of blue, which I initially thought was lightning.  Then It appeared to be getting closer and closer.  About 3-4 seconds later the light fully consumed my bedroom window and my whole room was lit up by this light.  I quickly jumped out of my chair and ran into the hallway, closing my bedroom door behind me.  Even when I closed the door and looked back the light had not subsided.  As far as I know the light was there for about 5-10 seconds.   I have seen my share of power lines going down and transformers exploding, but they flash and go out.  This was different than anything I have ever seen. After leaving my room, I immediately went to knock on my sisters door. She came out of her room in a panicked state and said, \"Did you hear that?\" We both ran downstairs into our moms bedroom and called 911. My sister then explained to me that the sound she heard was like a compressed boom, almost like a shockwave. As a side note I would like to add that 2 nights prior to this occurrence I looked out my window up into the sky and saw a bright light which was flashing red, green and blue. At first I thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but then I realized that the object was not moving. It was not a star and there is no way a helicopter could reach those kinds of elevations. I went to grab my camera which was on my desk and not even 5 seconds later the object was gone. From my window I have a really good view of the nights sky and there is no way a helicopter or plane could have disappeared from sight that quickly.

We had sliding glass doors out of our living room that went directly into our backyard.   Suddenly our yard was filled with a bright bluish white light that got the attention of my son and myself.  When we looked out the door, a glowing egg shaped craft, that could only have held one or two beings, was gliding silently through our yard.   We live in the city so we do not have a huge yard.  After it passed out doors, I ran to the front winidow to see where it would go....but it never came out from between the houses, which leads me to believe it took off after we saw it.  Strange to me was the fact that although he was sitting with us...my husband did not see the craft.   Without listening to each others account, my son and I gave a description of what we saw to my husband.  We both saw the same thing.  I am an armed security guard at Independence Hall and have been trained to observe and report things that I see.  I dont think 2 of us could be crazy at the sametime.   Why didn't my husband see it?  I have no idea! The reason I've decided to report this now is that about 2 weeks after the sighting, on Oct. 14,2008, my husband was hospitalized with a very rare brain fungal infection.  His doctors had no idea how he  contracted it...as it appeared nowhere else in his body, as it normally should.   He was in a coma for 2 months before they could figure out how to treat it.  My husband died this past August due to this infection.  I cant help but wonder if this sighting, that he said he didn't see, had anything to do with it.

      "story": "Orange size Fire-like Glowing Sphere in Pennsylvania July 30, 2011. I just heard you on C2C talking about July 30th in Pennsylvania and was quite excited.  I left my house just before 9PM on July 30th 2011 to ride to the store a couple of blocks for my house.  As I was approaching the store, I saw something flying down in the manner that a plane descends.  It was coming towards me very fast and as I concentrated my vision on it, it changed to a horizontal flight just about 20 feet above in front me and just flew right over my head.  It was about the size of an orange and looked almost like a glowing liquid fire, yellow orange in color.  It had no tail/trail.  I stopped my bike and by the time I placed my foot on the ground and turned around, it was gone.  I looked around and there was no sign of anything.  There was no sound at all.  There was a couple a few hundred feet behind me and I waited for them to reach me to see if they looked like they saw something, and it seems they didn't.  I mounted my bike and proceeded to the store. It! was 9:04 pm when I reached the store.  The whole event took place within a second or so. I am currently unemployed but I am a 6th Degree Black Belt in Classical Martial Arts of Okinawa and China.  I do not take drugs, do not drink alcohol and have no reason to lie. In fact, I posted the event on my Facebook as soon as i got back home.  My facebook name is Juku Cho.  Look for me and send me a friend request.  I'll accept you so you can see my post and my friend's responses.",

We were sitting and chatting when we heard a load noise that sounded like rubber hitting a fan, while simultaneously looking up and seeing an object.  The UFO were streams of moving lights that seemed to enclose a spool-shaped \"invisible\" form; there was a form but it was cloaked.  Both of us were staring at it and wondering out load what it was when we witnessed it tilt down towards 7:00 position, then fold backward and stretch out into a \"V\" triad of  lights, with a green (top) and red (bottom) light following directly behind the triad.

I happened to look up and saw 2 shapes in the sky.  I was looking toward the DE river, with the Philadelphia skyline to my left. There were 2 objects moving right to left across the sky. They did not appear to change speed or elevation, or their position in relation to each other. They moved across my field of view over the course of about 1-2 minutes.  I did not know how big they were so I could not judge how far away they were. The first object was sort of in the shape of an E with the E facing down at the ground.  It did not change orientation at any time.  The second object was in the shape of an elongated cylinder that was oriented horizontally relative to the ground.  It did not change orientation either. Both of the objects were the same color... I would describe it as a brushed stainless steel... there was no appearance of a polished finish. They did not behave like balloons.  They moved with very little change in elevation, and did not appear to move with the breeze.",

I noticed a light in my backyard and my son and I both went to our sliding glass doors.  What we saw was incredible.  It was an oval shaped craft, completely immersed in a white blue light.  It looked like a single person (being) craft.  It was gliding slowly through our yard, and came within 10 feet of my house.  It was only 5 or 6 feet off the ground.  If we had opened the door we could have touched it. We watched as it cruised past our door, past next door and towards the break between the houses.  I ran to the front door waiting for it to reappear from the break but it never came out.  It had to have gone up.  There was absolutely no sound coming from it.  What was strange was that none of my neighbors claim to have seen it.  My husband must have dozed off because he didnt see it.  My son who was 25 at the time didnt believe in UFO's until that night.

Noticed 6 Circular Dull Flash light Objects (UFO) with one Big Circle at the center and rest 4 Normal bright Circles at each corner of Big Circle and another Small Sparkling Oval Shaped UFO leading direction to follow my car.  I started noticing it when I took right onto US-13 S/Bristol Pike merging I-95S. 6 Circles followed my direction and small sparkling UFO was leading big ones. One the way it started raining, though I missed it, when rain stopped, again noticed it was following my direction, again I saw it. When I reached Philadelphia Downtown toward I-676 W/US-30, was heading for another pickup from Indian restaurant at University City, near UPenn & again when returning back I saw those UFO's it did not go away instead it was following me, wherever I go.  At last at 9:30PM I reached home to my Apartments near Philadelphia Museum of Arts,  These Circles were revolving and Circulating above my parking & my apartment, I called my wife to look out for circle from Balcony, she did saw the same circles, now the Big one remained dull and cloudy and we could see only half of it since it was positioned directly above my apartment but we could see rest 4 Circles and one Oval very bright shines ones like a Circular Aircraft - UFO's. It took a while 15 min approximately after I unloaded my things from my car, it disappeared in sky. Very remarkable experience.  but I don\u2019t have any photos or it never clicked my mind to video record this, All I felt was strange and curious and surprised, I could notice myself I was became very much concentrated on what I was doing even I pushed myself out to call my wife to see from Balcony, I had a feeling of deep meditation and single mind directed on what I was doing at that moment when I got out of my car for unloading. I couldn't explain anymore or I don\u2019t know how to explain this, it\u2019s an experience.  Worst thing when this incident happened nobody was around me to look at, it\u2019s a perfect time, I am not sure whether others noticed. I was searching for a official site to report this event.

      "story": "Smaller craft came out of a slit in the sky above the roof tops in a residential neighborhood.  It was a darker brushed metal color. Because it was such a long time ago, I am not quite sure the month of my siting, but I was with my girlfriend and it was the spring/summer of 1978.  We were starting 9th grade in the fall.  The location was northeast Philadelphia around the neighborhood of Tacony. Somewhere in between our two houses we were walking and saw an unusual light in the sky.  It wasn\u2019t a star or a plane because it was moving erratically but was controlled.  For example the light moved from right to left a distance of several blocks in a second.  Then we saw it move north to south in a distance of several blocks in a second.  And so on.  We started running around the neighborhood following it. Somehow we found ourselves quite a distance from our houses, we were standing by a neighborhood school near Vandyke Street in Philadelphia.  It was a catholic school I believe.  We were looking up in the sky and we lost sight of it.  Suddenly, the craft came out of an invisible slit in the sky if that makes any sense.  The entire thing didn\u2019t appear at once, it was as if there was an invisible door or envelope in the sky and something was coming through it. Now, it was not far up in the sky, it was about equal to the second floor of a row house.  Right above the roofs.  I did not find the shape described in the form that you have.  The best way I can describe it is if you put your two thumbs together and your index fingers together.  It\u2019s sort of a square shape that was sanded down at the edges to make it more rounded. The color of the metal was something I had never seen before, the best way I can describe the color is like a brushed metal, not shiny.  It was a darker color.  There were no lights on the craft at this time.  When we saw it in the sky it was a light.   There was also no sound. As soon as I saw it coming out of the invisible slit in the sky I took off running behind the school building after I picked my bottom jaw up off the ground &#61514;  My friend stood frozen and just stared up at it.  I was peeking around the building looking at her. I don\u2019t remember much after that except we walked home.  I was very late coming home.  It only seemed like an hour but I cannot remember what time I got home.  My mother was extremely angry with me especially when I insisted for days that I saw an unusual object in the sky which I followed and that was the reason I was late.  Actually for years after I insisted but everyone just laughed at me. It is strange but my friend and I never talked about what we saw after that.  You would think we would. I do not remember having any contact with any type of being.  I moved out of Philadelphia later that summer to another state but have since moved back to Pennsylvania but not Philadelphia. In my thirties, sometime late 1990s or 2000, I was home alone and I woke up, saw what looked like a strange being with a big head standing in my bedroom door way staring at me, I started screaming and then must have fallen back to sleep.  I\u2019m not sure if I was dreaming or not. I never reported this at the time of my siting because I was young, and no one believed me.  I listened to you on Coast to Coast and you mentioned that you would welcome reports of sitings despite how long ago it may have happened.  Thank you.

No matter what i did the round shape persisted.  i used some of the tools available to bring it in closer and in a sharper contrast. It is not an airplane,or birds, or a balloon, and is too round to be a meteor.  It is not flaw in the camera or lense.

      "story": "Dark, silent. boomerang shaped object seen by 3 in Philadelphia My friends and I were leaving a party at another friend's house around 2 am.  When we walked outside we immediately noticed how bright the stars were and how many of them we could see (We were in north central Philadelphia, near Temple university where even on the clearest nights you can hardly see stars because of the light pollution). We were all just taking a moment to look up at the stars, marveling at our freak ability to see so many. My friend remarked that he could see Orion's belt and that's about when I saw a dark, v shaped formation flying across the sky.  I though at first it was a flock of geese, especially since it was moving south east, but I quickly realized it wasn't. As soon as I said \"whoah, look at that planet\"; I realized it wasn't a plane at all, there were no lights on it and it was flying very low to the ground (maybe 600 or 700 feet in the air at most) it was also completely silent. (Just to be clear, we live near 2 air ports, we see taking off/landing planes all the time, daily, and this is not what they look like)   As soon as I pointed out the \"plane,\" then quickly corrected myself and said \"wait no, there's no lights on it, hold on..; it was out of sight.  It was moving silently, gliding, but it was moving at a pretty good speed.  My other two friends who had seen it confirmed how strange it was and we tried to run down the street to keep up with it, but lost sight due to the bright street lights and buildings in our way.",

      "story": "Orange Objects Ascending Over Philadelphia. On the evening in question I was traveling northbound on 95 approaching the Aramingo avenue exit.  I saw to my right several slowly rising objects from the northeast in my peripheral vision.  I then focused my attention to the objects. I counted approximately 12-15 of them.  The objects appeared to be triangular in shape with a solid orange color.  There were no visible navigation, beacon, or strobe lights, which are required on all civilian aircraft, and usually on military aircraft as well.  I did not hear any sound from the objects, although I was traveling at highway speed and only briefly put the window down.  The objects slowly gained altitude.  I would estimate from approximately 150 ft AGL up to 12-1300ft AGL at which point I lost visual reference due to traveling in the opposite direction. They appeared to originate from an approximate heading of 040\u00ba magnetic on an outbound of approximately 235\u00ba toward the downtown area.  It appeared as if they remained in a tight formation of 2-3 craft in front, at a slightly higher altitude, 4 in a roughly arrow formation, and the remainder flew in sequence.  The overall formation reminded me of the uneven arrow which geese fly in when heading south for winter.  My passenger also witnessed the event and she continued to maintain visual reference while I returned my attention to driving.  I could see the objects in the rearview mirror for approximately 2 more miles until I exited the motorway.  Sky conditions on the evening in question were approximately 8 miles visibility, no cloud bases, and a light (&lt;5knots) wind.  There was no snow on the ground at the time, there was no snow falling at the time, nor were there reports of snowfall in the area.  I reviewed temporary flight restrictions, which would notify airmen of any launches or abnormal flight operations, and found none for the evening in question or the surrounding week.  My background is in aviation, and this is unlike anything I have seen in my career.  The lack of sound and slow speed makes me of the opinion that it was not a formation of fixed wing aircraft.  The lack of sound, abnormal lighting, and elevation also makes me skeptical that it could be a helicopter fleet.  I have made this report several months after the fact only because I did not get around to it and also because I have recently seen several videos online, from Philadelphia, which show almost exactly what I saw.  Having seen those, my opinion is even more so that what I saw was indeed abnormal. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

I was so taken back by this \" light\" that I leaned against a brick wall to watch its movements.

I noticed that it kept getting brighter and dimmer and at one point saw a flicker if and orange light either on the right side or the underbelly of the light.   The light appeared to be circular, but mainly just a slow moving light.  Since I was already feeling crazy, I asked the light to turn on and off so I knew it was really there and I wasn't imagining things, but instead it slowed down directly overtop and in front of me and dropped a smaller white light that flickered down and immediately disappeared, at which point the larger light sped up, turned and orangey- red color, and sped away.   I should also mention that the street went from being filled to nothing during about a 5 minute time frame, and I believe I was the only witness on my street.   After the light passed and I crossed the street, cars and people started showing up again.  There you go!",

The report stated that the object looked like a star with another light going around it, the report is from Chester, PA, on 2/15/2014. This seems very similar to an object I have seen off and on over Philadelphia for many years.  I have shown this to others and have looked at it through binoculars, the object seems very stationary and does not move out of view from the sight of the binoculars as planets and other objects do. I would describe it as a bright  blue white object with lights spinning around it.  The smaller lights I would say are \u00bc the size of the central object and can be red, blue and yellow and spin rather quickly around the center object in multiple directions.  The object also can seem larger or smaller and appear in different parts of the sky.  The object does not seem to move as a planet does or any other object I have ever looked at in the sky.  We have many helicopters and planes over Philadelphia and the object does not move the same way as them either.  The object I would say is very still and at times moves but not when I am looking at it. I have an interest in sky watching and have tracked planets across the sky and they move fairly quick past your view in a telescope or binoculars this object does not have any of those characteristics.  I have been seeing this since the late 80's and have seen it last year at times.",

I initially spotted one by itself, which looked very different than normal airline traffic (which is almost non-stop in the airspace over my area).  The object was not blinking and there was no discernible sound.   Immediately afterwards, 4 pairs of the same type of object flew in the same direction/altitude/speed, followed by 3 more that flew over individually.   The strangest part was that some of them seemed to very quickly \"burn out\" and disappear before leaving my line of sight. This seemed remarkably similar to a sighting I saw posted on this site in Broomall just a few days ago.  My most logical guess was that these were helicopters at higher than normal altitude, but the lack of any sound has really puzzled me.  I have never seen anything like them.

It seemed to just be sliding across the sky in a way I have never seen before.  There was an orange glow coming from behind it.  The edges were extremely pointed. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.  I just remember looking at my friends to see the reactions on their faces and by the time I looked back at the sky the object was gone.  We heard no noises.

Stopped for 2 seconds, Then flashed green real bright.  Then flew away faster then anything I ever seen before.  I was freaking out. Because I am very aware of UFO's n always watch alien documentaries all the time, and I once saw something I thought was a UFO.  But this was very close, only about 3 blocks away I'd say. And its just so (I can't even explain the feeling) to actually witness it first hand, and so close. So had a really bad feeling about it.  Why in Philly?  A largely populated city where a lot of people are still out at 1 am.  That means they are started not to care if see. Which I believe is either a very bad thing.  Or a very bad thing.  No good can come of this. I even posted on a social media about it to see if anyone else seen it.  And my friend said he did. I didn't even give a description of it.  I just asked if anyone s! een that in the sky, and he said \"I seen it. It was a greenish light rite.  It flashed and I was waiting for the boom.  I almost ((deleted)) panicked .  I'm just so overwhelmed and needed somewhere to vent where I wouldn't sound crazy.  Cause like they all say \"I know what I saw\"",

      "story": "Cigar-shaped close encounter, brilliantly lit, appeared to be fusion powered like the Sun, size of city bus. UFO June 25, 1965, Philadelphia, PA.  The UFO report I am making took place in Philadelphia on June 25, 1965. At the time I was eleven years old.  I am a retired Air Force Intelligence Officer (Major), and Veteran of The Gulf War. I was sitting looking out a window when I saw a large bright object descending at a fast rate of speed.  It was coming down at a 45% angle at perhaps fifty miles per hour.  I thought it was a rocket, because of its shape, a cylinder with rounded ends.  I ran and hid behind the couch away from the window.  I expected an explosion but heard nothing, so I looked out.  I saw the UFO hovering a block down the street over roof tops. The UFO had descended at 22nd Street, descending at the intersection of 22nd and Mount Vernon Street, moving North then stopping at 22nd and Wallace Street.  I was viewing the object from my Grandmother and Grandfather's 3rd floor apartment window at 643 North 22nd Street, Philadelphia, Pa, on June 25th, 1968. The UFO followed the outline of all the homes and buildings-opposite my side of the street, including a church.  It flew just feet above the roof tops. It would pause, descend, and rise, hovering about ten feet above all the roof tops.  It was as if it was viewing inside the homes.  It moved slowly traveling at walking pace. The UFO was the length of a city bus, with rounded ends, but wider in circumference.  It was a large cylinder, it had no markings of any kind, no wings, no visible engines, no windows. The entire surface was made up of a plasma field, like a close up image of the Sun.  These gases or ions spun and disappeared under the surface, diving and rising like a gas.  The brightness was intense.  It was composed of several colors, white, yellow and orange.  It reminded me of someone mixing giant cans of paint.  It was very beautiful but hard on the eyes because of its brilliance. At this point in my life I think what I saw then was a fusion powered ship. At one point I turned around looking behind me into the apartment and noticed the patterns of light also produced shadows on my Grandmothers walls.  The patterns it produced on the walls were dark with light edges.  The patterns matched the moving patterns of the vessel's surface.  The only thing I've ever seen similar are close up films of the Sun.  In addition to the swirling patterns of light I noticed it was layered in a dimple pattern that covered its entire surface.  The dimples appeared to vibrate but stayed in place like those on a basketball while plumes of gas rose and fell like filaments of a magnet.  This was truly amazing to see!  At times I used my hands to shield my eyes.  It was the brightest light I've ever seen and today I'm sixty years old, as of November 2014.  I was alone viewing the object.  My Grandfather was at work and my Grandmother went downstairs to another apartment for a short time. It approached my location stopping directly in front of me. I did not feel any heat.  At this point it was about 80 feet away, close enough to throw a ball to it!  I was able to observe this object for perhaps five minutes, in total, which seemed then to be a long time.  As I said it paused several times over apartments, then would move and stop again several times. Just before the UFO changed direction (descending, or rising, stopping or starting to move forward) it emitted a loud sound.  The sound always preceded its change in movement by about two seconds each time.  So I knew when it was going to move again.  The sound reminded me of a loud hiss from an old steam train.  I'm not saying there was steam just that the sound was similar to that or when a large truck makes releasing air brakes. Once the UFO got to the last building at the intersection of 22nd and Fairmont Streets it angled at 45 degrees, with its front end pointing up, it rose about fifty feet. I ran to another window on the side facing Wallace Street, so was able to watch it again.  It leveled off, then flew over the walls of the Eastern State Penitentiary, it picked up speed at about 35 miles per hour flying North.  It continued flying North at a level constant speed until I lost view of it.  This craft was definitely controlled by an intelligence. When my Grandmother came in I told her what I had witnessed.  We were both very religious, she had difficulty believing my story and asked me to swear by placing my hand on The Bible, which I did.  She was convinced and saddened that she had missed this wonderful sight by just minutes. That evening or perhaps the next night we watched a TV program that highlighted the vessel I had seen and their closer encounter with it.  The program was \"The Arthur Godfrey Show\", or one of his \"Specials.\"  Arthur Godfrey was a respected pilot, and was a colonel in the Air Force Reserve.  Arthur Godfrey and Frank Munciello another experienced pilot were flying in a small aircraft from New York to Washington, DC.  Their flight path took them over or near Philadelphia on the same day of my encounter.  Live on national TV Author Godfrey described that a brilliantly lit vessel followed and maneuvered around his aircraft.  He said it matched his course and speed.  He admitted he was scared of the vessel's close maneuvers until it finally veered off.  Arthur Godfrey was a well know TV producer and TV host.  His TV program was viewed by millions of Americans.  My grandparents and I knew he was describing the same vessel I had seen.  An account of Arthur Godfrey's story c! an be read on Ufodocarchiv.org. Later as an Intelligence Officer I often gave my squadron current intelligence briefings.  I was an Intelligence Officer of the 732nd Military Airlift Squadron at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey.  I served in this position for approximately ten years, including during the Gulf War.  During one briefing an Aircrew explained to me they encountered a Ball Lightening Encounter, also called Saint Elmo's Fire.  A sphere of charged particles entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet.  The aircraft was a C-141 Starlifter.  The sphere about three feet in diameter entered the cockpit then floated inside the aircraft to the cargo bay where it hovered for a time then vanished.  They asked of I entered the airframe of their aircraft while cruising at 40,000 feet.  The aircraft was a C-141 Starlifter.

This upset my Squadron Training Officer who verbally reprimanded me, I was ordered to never speak about UFO's again.",

I did not feel any heat.  At this point it was about 80 feet away, close enough to throw a ball to it! I was able to observe this object for perhaps five minutes in total, which seemed then to be a long time.  As I said it paused several times over apartments, then would move and stop again several times.  It flew over the bell tower of The Olivet Covenant Presbyterian church (current name) at 22nd and Wallace Streets, just across from my location. Just before the UFO changed direction (descending, or rising, stopping or starting to move forward) it emitted a loud sound.

It was not a blimp,  I had seen these vessels before for the Philadelphia Army Navy games traditionally held in Philadelphia in those years.

My grandparents and I knew he was describing the same vessel I had seen. An account of Arthur Godfrey's! story can be read on Ufodocarchiv.org. In 1993 I happened across a book, \"The UFO Encyclopedia\" by John Spencer. On page 129 I read the account by Arthur Godfrey validating my sighting. Later accounts of Arthur Godfrey's story have been muddied. Some report the incident online as 1964, 1965 and 1966, some report it was during the evening, or say he was reporting an event he witnessed years earlier. The actual date he saw the vessel was June 25 1965, then he reported it in the evening. He was not in both places at the same time. As I viewed his broadcast myself, I was stunned at his anger and asking for an explanation as to what had happened. He was mad because this event had just happened, and was not years prior as some recent reports are now saying. I hope someone can track down a recording of that broadcast. I can recall to this day my Grandparents discussing me and what to do about the sighting. My Grandmother wanted to call Mr Arthur Godfrey who had just reported the sighting on national TV.  My Grandfather opposed it saying I would be tagged as the Flying Saucer Boy or some other bad thing that would only cause me harm. I remember my Grandmother wanting to talk to someone at The Franklin Institute Planetarium in Philadelphia. She wanted to know if others had reported seeing the vessel.  I stayed several weeks with my Grandparents, finally they told me not to mention it to anyone.  Years later, as an Intelligence Officer, I often gave my Air Force squadron current intelligence briefings.  I was an Intelligence Officer in the 732nd Military Airlift Squadron at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey,  I served in this position for approximately ten years, including during The Gulf War.

I figured they were airplanes queued up for landing except I realized they were stationary.  They were not stars as they were flickering with high level of clarity as opposed to the way one would see a distant star flicker.  I noticed two of the lights were in sync so I figured then that maybe it was a tower that I just had never noticed before until other lights started to appear.  Some were moving very slowly.  Slow enough to be helicopters drifting as they hovered, but there was no sound and then more appeared.  Some disappeared and the two that were in sync went out of sync.  I noticed a total of about 10 lights.  I used my binoculars to see what I could but could only really make out balls of light as it was dark.  I did notice that at least one light was reddish while the others were mostly white. I went to get my wife to look and by the time she came out, the lights had gone from about 10 back to 2 and then a few planes came through the area and the lights disappeared.",

They reminded me of military flare used to illuminate the ground when shot into the sky or dropped by an aircraft.   They were in different heights and fairly close to each other in a vertical line.  There was some stagger to their order as they were not in a straight vertical line.   After watching for 2-5 minutes, they dimmed and then disappeared, while staying in the same spot in the distant sky.

Just a few moments ago on the 3rd floor of my townhouse in South Philly facing City Hall exactly 2 miles away, I was putting my 3 year old son to bed.   He was over my shoulder looking out the window when he said, \"what's that?\"  Lots of helicopters and airport traffic pass over our heads on the way to the airport, and there's a helipad or two in the city so I'm quite accustomed to the aircraft in the area.  This one was intriguingly different.   I stood by the window to watch for about 2 minutes, then put him to bed, then ran up to our 4th floor deck, grabbed the binoculars and watched it for about 2 more minutes before it suddenly disappeared before my eyes.  \"It\" was two green lights side by side, kind of like headlights, but not blinking.  Usually you expect with aircraft to see white lights and/or red lights, and blinking.   The green was eye-catching.  It hovered west behind the Comcast skyscraper, then went UP, then wafted back east toward City Hall.  Then it turned red! Again no blinking, just both lights slowly changed to red.   It hovered around a bit as though circling City Hall, then turned green again, then gradually red, then like I said, right in front of my eyes, vanished.

It was still dark, and I went to let the dog out because it was barking abnormally.  It never barks at this time, I simply thought it had to go relieve itself.   I opened the door and I heard a loud buzz, looked up and saw three lights in a triangle form.  They moved east very fast, but still within my sight line, then back west very fast and stopped in the air, I actually rubbed my eyes and looked back, screamed for the dog to come back, then went up to get my wife, she saw the same thing, this time we watched from our second floor balcony.  And they were making strange movements, nothing like an aircraft I have ever seen or known about.  Very odd experience.   We recorded it on my wife's cell phone.",

We happened to notice a strange looking star-like object, maybe 45 degrees from the horizon.  We were looking north.  It was faintly flashing blue and red lights.\t    After observing it for a while, we started to notice tiny little lights going to and from it.  We got out the telescope, but having never used it before, it took us a while to find the object.  When we did, it appeared to be just a round white sphere.  We didn\u2019t see any little lights with the telescope. The object didn\u2019t move for approx. 2-2 \u00bd  hrs.  As we were looking at the object, it took off at an extremely high rate of speed in an easterly direction.  There is a tree across the street, and I tried to run down the sidewalk to see where it was going, but by the time I got to other side of the tree, it was gone. Might I add that I was not a believer until I witnessed that.  I know that whatever I saw, was not from this world.  Even if I hadn\u2019t seen it move, it might be different, but I saw it go from a complete standstill, to moving like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen mover through the sky.",

I live on the 21st floor of an apartment building.  It was brighter than anything I've ever seen at night, so I walked to the window to take a look at it.   Off in the distance there was an object just hovering/floating.  It stayed in one spot for several minutes then it changed color from red lights to green lights.  After a few minutes it moved very quickly from one spot to another and just hovered in that spot for a few minutes.   I woke my girlfriend up to look and ran to the other room to wake my brother up also.  My girlfriend told me to take a video, but I didn't, thinking no one would believe me and not knowing that this website was out there.   After a few minutes it turned to red again and moved very quickly across the sky to another location.  After a few minutes the object started to drop down and disappeared behind a building that was in front of my building.  The object moved WAY too quick to be a helicopter or plane and just moved so effortlessly through the sky.   The colors were unlike anything I've ever seen and when they changed colors, it was like nothing I've ever seen.",

It had green, red, and yellowish/white lights running across it.  Couldn't tell the shape because it was behind some trees in the distance.   What caught both my wife and I's attention was that the lights returned to a position in the sky where we could see it behind the tree in a swaying manner.  Not typical for an aircraft, and after spending 10 years in the Air Force (Edwards AFB & Pentagon), I knew that was not normal not even for a helicopter to maneuver in such an erratic manner.

      "story": "Black balloon and another man in black. November 2008, about 5 minutes past 8:00 pm.  I'm walking home alone from a friend's house.  Something catches my eye on the night sky.  It looks like it appears to be a black balloon drifting above the sheet metal factory that's located above my block as I'm thinking.   I keep my eyes on it with the intentions of watching the balloon until it drifted away and was no longer in sight.  But this object didn't do just that, it paused in mid air.  Once that happened, I slowly jogged closer to the sheet metal factory to get a much better view.  What I then seen in the sky was a perfect black circle with a thin white rim around it. Very still and not moving but floating above the metal factory.  I was the only person outside at the time.  On usually a bright busy street it seem very still and somewhat dark that night, for the circle to be darker than the sky.  My cell phone wasn't advanced enough to take a good photo of the object so I figured why waste my time trying to record ! for such poor quality.   I keep my eyes on the object for a good 15 seconds.  Suddenly, the white door beside the sheet metal factory on Wyncote avenue opens up and out came a African American male wearing all black.  Long sleeve black shirt, black pants, and black boots.  This man was standing directly under the object floating about the building.  He smoothly lit up his cigarette staring at me from across the street, but I gave him temporary attention and looked back up at the object.  Then in a quick second, the object disappears.  Not saying a word to the man in black across the street.   I anxiously run to my house and tell everyone the exclusive news.  This happened at the very exact location of me meeting the strange Asian like man in black.  This took place many months close to a year after my first encounter.

      "story": "Men in black are real, no one can tell me otherwise My first strange encounter. A past girlfriend of mine has been evicted from her north Philadelphia apartment, with no where for her to go, I ask my grandmother, \"Can my girlfriend spend the night with us, since she has no where go?\"  My grandmom replied, \"No, she cannot stay here,\" which led to me and my girl leaving the house together and getting into her 1993 Buick lasabre that was parked at the very beginning of the block.  We could not figure out where to go at that time, so we both ended up dosing off and falling asleep in her car with the seats reclined back. To my surprise I wake up from hearing an aggressive knock at the dark tinted passenger window beside me.  The knock was similar to the way a police knocks on your window at a regular traffic stop.  I turned my head towards the window, I look up and see an Asian like man with very dark pitch black eyes, both of his eyes were black like some sort of demon staring right at us.   I reach for the handle to open the door and approach this strange looking person, and my girlfriend pulled back on me saying, \"Don't get out of the car, why ((profanity deleted)) do his eyes look like that?\"  In a scared tone.   So me playing the brave guy role at the time, ignoring my girlfriend I get out of the car anyway and approach this person.  Feeling slightly dizzy and drowsy like I would normally waking up out of a short sleeping session.  I'm literally standing about two feet away from this guy, directly looking into his eyes, thinking to myself, \"This is one ugly strange looking ((profanity deleted)).   His skin was so pale which made him look even weirder. He was dressed in a black tight fitting long sleeve black shirt, with black cargo pants and black footwear, and he was built like a small Asian guy with Asian like features.  The closer I'm moving towards him, the more jumpy this guy is acting but not in a aggressive way, more like a defensive way as if I was going to attack him. I ask him \" what's the problem?\"  And he responded in a soft low tone saying, \"Yea, man just go home.\"  I replied back wiping my dreary eyes still feeling dazed saying, \"I live on this block.\"  Then he replied for the second time saying \"yea I know, just go home man,\" like he was trying to help me out.  So I asked feeling slightly disturbed and annoyed saying\" so what are you a cop or something?\"  Then he replied back somewhat studdering with a slight snicker saying \" ye yea I'm a cop\".   I said \"ok\" as the guy turns his back to me and walk towards this vehicle that's double parked crookedly in th! e street I'm also stunned by the vehicle he gets in.  It's a white Hyundai, not just any average white Hyundai.  This was one of the most amazing, cleanest, spotless vehicles I've ever seen in my life at the time.  They look similar to the way they look now in 2015 but this was back in the 2007 or 2008 time period. The headlights on the car were extremely bright shining down the block opposite of me.  I mean these light were bright, and he was driving alone because I noticed no one else in the vehicle.  I got a good look of the front of the car and seen the tilted \"H\" symbol on the grill of the car.  That last how I know it wasn't a Honda, this was a Hyundai.  It was like a car in the future to me back then, and how they look now reminds me of this encounter every time I see one ride past. He then sped off down wyncote avenue and I got back in the car with my girlfriend.  She's asking me \"what did he say?  I tell her that he must've been an undercover cop and her car probably matched the description of another car used in a crime in my neighborhood.  With that said I flagged the situation away like it was no big deal and continued the rest of the night out with my girlfriend. What puzzles me about this, is the fact that no police badge was present at the time, no walkie talkies, no back up no weapon.  This guy was very gentle but intimidating.

December 18, 2015     Sir:  About 17:35 CST, in the Northeastern quadrant of Neshoba county, Mississippi, I witnessed a craft of unknown size for about 2 minutes.  This was a little after sundown but still there was enough light for me to see my dog about 75 yards away.  I couldn't tell the shape because of the bright lights that were situated on the top and the bottom of the craft.  I watched it hover for the period of time stated and then entered my home to call for someone else to observe.  When I again exited my home the object was gone.  The appearance of the object, as far as I could see, was as though there was a straight line with three lights on top and three lights on bottom.  As I said, the lights were very bright and prevented me seeing any detail other than what has been stated.  From my position, I was looking approximately at a 30 degree angle and the object was about \u00be  of a mile away.  After it was no longer in my view, about 7 to 10 minutes later,  a jet came from the north, heading in a southern direction.  To our NNE, about 50 miles away is Columbus Air Force Base.  To our SSE is the Meridian Naval Air Station, about the same distance.  I hope this helps. I have an MBA and a B.S. Degree in Secondary Education.

On May 3, 2016, Philadelphia, PA, 8:39 PM, on steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, facing downtown, I took two photos with my Iphone.  The first is wide view.  The second is zoomed in, from the same step location, immediately after the first. I did not notice anything in the sky when I took the photos.  My intent was to get a photo of the city at night. Later when looking at the photos, I noticed the row of lights in the clouds.  I can assume reflection in the clouds, or reflection on the camera lens, but a few observations leaves some doubt.  The lights change position in relation to the buildings.  The lights keep their same relative size to the buildings. I take that to be the lights were in the sky above or beyond the buildings, and the lights moved in relation to the buildings. The other item is that the lowest light is brighter than the 7 above it. The sky was cloudy.  I estimate the distance from the photo position on the museum steps to the tall buildings in the photo is 6000 feet, scaling from a map. Please review the photos I emailed and let me know if you think the largest probability is that it was city lights reflecting, and how to discount the relative position change with the buildings.  If the clouds were moving and the lights were reflections, I doubt the lights would have maintained their relationship with each other.",

      "story": "4 Bright White Cigar/Long Disc Shape - Traveling Slanted in sky - Dissapeared & Reappeared 3 jets chasing them -Witnessed by 2 in car On Saturday, November 5th, 2016, roughly some time between 5:15-5:45 PM EST, myself (driving) and another male occupant (passenger) in a moving car traveling South on  Route 1 in Northeast Philadelphia witnessed 4 objects in the sky that appeared to have either been being chased or observed by 3 military jets. It was at that point in the late day, when the sun is just starting to go down, so it was still very bright outside.  The sky was extremely clear, and there was not a  single cloud in sight anywhere to be seen. As I was driving South on Route 1 in Northeast Philadelphia, I was passing right at the area of Route 1 (Roosevelt Boulevard) and Oxford Avenue, and I was in the far  left lane of the middle lane. I just happened to look up at the sky in front of me and to the left, when I noticed what I right away assumed to be just a white cloud  stationary and not at all moving up in the sky. After passing Oxford avenue, I got stuck at the next traffic light.  I kept looking at the object and noticed that it was not moving at all, and that there were no  clouds anywhere in the entire sky.  As I kept staring at it, I thought it was a very starge looking cloud, and then very quickly realized it was not a cloud at all. When I realized this was not a bird, cloud, or an airplane or helicoptor, or any known aviation object I have ever seen before, I asked my passenger, \"Do you see that  up there?, What is that?\"  He was amazed just like me and we sat in traffic for about 30-90 seconds just staring at it. It was not moving at all, niether were we.  That  is how we know it was not moving. I was driving, and because we both were staring in confusion at just what exactly we were looking at, it never occured to either one of us to get a photo of it with  our phones.  I'm not sure it would have turned out anyway. We started driving again, and I could see it starting to move downwards, or in the direction coming closer to  the ground.  But it was very, very high up in the sky, and it was oviously very big. In front of me and to the left there were high trees, and we both lost sight of the object for a few seconds, then we saw it again after passing the trees off the side  of the road.  We came to another traffic light and were stopped.  And then thats when we could see it more clearly, and we had the trees as an eye-sight-marker, as the  object was in back of the foreground trees in our sight. So once we were stopped we could clearly see the object more visible in detail and how it was movong and traveling using the tree as a marker. It kept moving downward in back of the trees, and as soon as we started driving again, when we got out in the open more where the sky was more open and visible, thats when we saw them. 3 more  of the same exact kind appeared out of nowhere to the left of the first object we saw. We dont know if they were already there and were just obscured by the trees or not, but I only saw the one at first, when the viewable sky was all open for my vision. And like I stated above, it initially was not moving and was actually closer.  The more we drove in it's direction (South) the further away it became.  It was oviously  movong very fast. There were a total of 4 objects in the sky, and they were all the exact same shape and white-brightness, still not known if it was the sun refecting off the object, making it so bright during that time of day, at least thats how I percieved what I was looking at. My passenger said that the other 3 to the left just dissapeared and  then reappeared right in the air.  I did not see that myself. The Description of the Object: - It was a very bright-white, possibly from the sun reflecting off it's surface, and it was either the shape of a cigar, but it was tilted. And when it moved, it  stayed titled, no matter which direction it moved, the tilt stayed. Im not sure about the cigar-shape, but I would describe it more like this: If you took a frisbee  and looked at it directlyin front of you looking at the side, so you not seeing a circle, but the other way, it would look like a sstraight line, but slightly ovaled,  but then on top of that, tilt it so that the left end it pointed down and the right end is pointed up. There were no colors or visible features, but it was also very high and far away to be able to clearly see it. When I thought it was traveling downwards closer to the  ground, I really think it was traveling further away. That is how fast it was moving. It, and the other 3 just kept getting smaller and smaller, you could tell they  were moving very fast. And as it moved, like I mentioned, the \"tilt\" of the object never changed. Still driving, I looked to the right up in the sky to see if there were more of these things, and that's when I saw, very, very high up, 3 jets/planes of some kind,  looked to be classic silver/metal in color of a jet, traveling in the same direction as the objects. All 3 jets were moving what seemed to be slow compared to the  other 4 objects. Each jet was leaving a clear small air vapor behind itself which quickly dissapated. As soon as I turned my head away from the 3 jets to the right sky, I watched the 4 objects to the left start moving extremely fast, as if they just caught wind of the  3 jets coming their way. If these were, oviously, military jets sent up to observe or chase these objects, they would most likely have been sent from Willow Grove Air  Force base in Warminster, Pennsylvania, which was roughly 20 miles away from our driving location. They must have gotten there quick, because when I first looked  around after seeing the first object not moving at all, I saw nothing else anywhere. And the 3 jets were pretty high up. At this point we both observed the 4 objects, which seemed to be each about 2 miles apart from each other, and the other 3 further ahead now from the 1st object we  witnessed, traveling at great speed, still with the \"tilt\" not changing at all, all 4 objects within 3 seconds, just took off southbound at incredible speed, and then  they just dissapeared over the horizon. To describe the 1st object, as it was stationary and not moving in better detail, it just hung in the sky, like a cigar, tilted, shining very bright white, as if the  sun was reflecting off it, I am pretty good at judging distance with my eyes, so just a guess, I would say it was about 1-2 miles in length, and roughly about 5-6  miles away. I really wish I could have got a photo of it when is was just sitting there in the sky, but I was driving and it all happened to fast. This was the first time for both of us ever seeing an object we could both say was a UFO for sure. If it was a black-project type object, who knows. But we are  absolutely both sure of what we witnessed, and this was not a mistaken known aircraft. And also we both have never seen such a thing, or expected to ever see such a  thing in this area of Northeast Philadelphia where we were at the time. The entire thing was very strange.  We did look around at other drivers to see if they were looking up at it too, and we did not see anyone looking at it.  Although,  people were driving, it would have been hard to have witnessed it, unless you were stuck at a light, and just happened to look up. I even had my window rolled down with my head out the window, so I know my vision was not obscured in anyway.  That was it.  The objects vanished once they took off  southbound at an incredible high rate of speed, staying at their \"tilt\" in the sky, and 30 minutes later, the sun was gone and that was the end of it.  We witnessed nothing else afterwards as we drove in the opposite direction going home.",

Looking out my window while star gazing I witnessed a slow moving object travel from my south to my east at an altitude of aprroximately 65 degrees.  At first I thought the object was an aircraft.  Upon further inspection with my 10 x's binoculars there were no navigation lights however the craft was somehow illuminated.  Its color appeared a rusty orange.  Through the binocs the size of the UFO would be compared to a jet airliner.  I could not make out any exact details of the flying object except it was cigar shaped with what appeared to be solar panels or wings of some kind located around the middle of the its body. The evening was clear, the moon was not up yet and in or near it's last quarter phase. Conditions were favorable for star gazing.  My dilemma, since there were no lights on the aircraft, why or how was it illuminated? Looking through my binoculars (10 x's)the craft I saw was about the same size as a jet airliner. The UFO gave no emission or contrail. It had to be in at least a low orbit around our planet. That far away, looking through my binoculars it appeared to be the same size as a jet airliner.  The object had to be gigantic for it to appear the size as a jet airliner. How else could the object be illuminated if not from the moon's reflection.  I've seen, on many occasions, the ISS and never have been able to see any detail of that craft the way I did this object. So, here I am making a UFO report.",

      "story": "Solid/Flashing light over the Atlantic Ocean. December 26, 2016.  While on a routine flight from New York to Miami, we saw a very unusual light.  We were in cruise at FL410, Mach .80, unlimited visibility with a temp of -55c, approximately 100NM off the coast near Atlantic City (close to Philadelphia), and on a true course of around 160.  Between 2130-2200 EST. I looked up I saw a very large and bright flashing light, which I brought to the other pilot\u2019s attention.  His response when seeing it was pretty much the same as mine\u2026. \u201cWhat in the hell\u201d\u2026 \u201cWhat is that?\u201d   The size of course is hard to tell.  The other pilot explains it as 3-4 times the size of the largest star around.  I think it was 4-5x.   The object was approximately 25-30 degrees up from our line of sight when I first saw it.  Its range of motion was between the horizon (from what I could see) to around 35 degrees up from our line of sight.  At first sight the light was approximately at our 1 o\u2019clock position.  It moved to 12, 10, 11, back to 12.  At that time, the light appeared to move North, then south, at a pretty rapid rate.  Or I would describe it as closer and further from our position as the size seemed to get larger and smaller.  The light ended in the 1st position and then moved out east and once at our 10 o\u2019clock position disappeared.  The other pilot stated he could see an! orange/red flash in between the white flashes.   We did flash our lights at it a few times and the other pilot believes it flashed back in sequence, I felt the return flashes were probably coincidental, but possible.  The flashing didn\u2019t really appear to have any pattern.  The whole incident lasted a minimum of 10 minutes. Neither one of use have ever seen and/or heard of an occurrence like this.  We were going to report it to ATC, but mutually decided to let it be.  I have no explanation for what we saw nor does the other pilot.  We did try to video the incident, but it wasn't possible. Captain ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke twice via telephone with the source of the report, and he sounded to us to be both sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a superlative, and highly reliable, witness.  PD))",

It did not seem like a full ship, to me, but a series of lights in the sky on the same trajectory.  I say this because the lights, from my vantage point, seemed random.

      "story": "Strange globe sighting--1969. Thank you for allowing me to share my own story. Back in July 1969, I was a teenager of 16 yrs old. I was lying in bed semi-asleep, when a high-pitched sound started. This sound was like a pure sinewave tone, I would estimate around 10Khz to 15Khz. I thought it was the cheap table fan on the small table by the window - it was a hot night. So I went to shut it off, thinking the motor maybe needed oiling, and I'd do that the next day. My parents and sisters were alseep in their rooms, and I didn't want to wake them by going down the squeaky stairs to the basement for oil. When I shut the fan off, the noise continued, and seemed to come from outside. I walked over to the window, which was open, and looked out. What I saw was utterly amazing to me! Hovering motionless over Mr Allen's roof which was about 150 feet away, was this globe-like thing. It was about 5 or 6 feet in diameter, perfectly round, and was a dark greyish semi-shiney color. It just hovered there, not moving, and I kept hearing that \"whistle/tone\" that I mentioned before. There were no lights on it. I went to my parents bedroom and woke my mom up, but she complained that I was goning to wake my dad up - I told her to come to my room, she refused and told me to go back to bed and shut up. So I went back to my bedroom, and sat by the window, watching that thing, amazed by it. After about 20 minutes, it literally flew straight up in the air and disappeared, and instantly that sound stopped, like turning off a switch. The speed of this thing was almost instant, like 500 miles an hour I would guess. It just vanished! I weant back to bed, lay there and eventaully drifted off to sleep. But I'll never forget what I saw, and I know it wasn't a dream, because the next day mom confronted me about waking her up the night before. I've talked about this to others, and the usual response was typical - thay I was making this story up. But I know better. I'm not dumb. Thanks again for allowing me to share this.",

I captured a video of it too.  It appears to be flying and spinning at the same time. It appears to be shiny, having a somewhat silver appearance.  I believe it was just one craft.",
