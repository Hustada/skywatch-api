      "story": "Summer of '99 Nostrodamus prophecy sighting near WPAFB To all concerned citizens, if you could help me with this problem it would be greatly appreciated.  I had just came home from work, fixed a meal and ate, when I decided to sit outside and enjoy the night air in my backyard. I was out there for about 30-45 minutes after sunset when the clouds started coming in, the weather called for rain, so as I was watching some of the forcasted clouds come in, I peered up and to my amazement I caught what I beleived to be a ship hiding in concealment. So, I was transfixed on it as it passed slowly by there was no sound coming from this ship at all. Then it occured to me that Nostrodamuses claim was wrong it wasn't meteors he saw but alien spacecraft.To my greatest suprise I would get to see two of the worlds greatest theories come to pass. As I watched as it passed overhead, another came by then another, then another, as I was calculating where they were going. I figured it was WPAFB. Then they stopped. The ship overhead was a triangle in shape with three large viewing windows from my observation,ther was also two figures in the windows which seemed to be looking directly towards me, so I just politely waved greeting them to Dayton. Then all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw a bluish type of light, like that on Star Trek's transporter system. Well to my suprise it seemed like there were little children running around my yard playing. I couldn't see them physically because they had on something that made them seem to be invisible. Like that suit the predator wore when he was fighting Arnold S. then as i am looking around I feel a little one lean on my leg and seem to be looking right into my face, and another start playing in my hair, like they have never seen a black guy before. It was just amazing that there kids was just as curious as mine are. So I peer back up and smile & laugh that the two are still there in the window are still looking down on us. It must have been at least 20 or more minutes they stayed in my yard playing. The ships started moving out, I would guess that WPAFB had difficulty greeting our new friends and unloading there belongings. I would guess this ship that stopped over my head was a passenger vehicle, because there was more vehicles to come. The next was box shaped,like a transporter. The one after that had my magneto pulse drive system underneath. I counted at least ten ships, but the last two gave me goose bumps you could tell these were not peace loving ships these were built for fighting. they were larger than the rest with deep grooves and edges, and just looked terrorfying. WPAFB was busy that night,lol. I thank the lord for letting me be a part of this. But I would like to see the proof that I am not Haluccinating. If you could get the weather pictures it might be able to prove it. Nostradamus, and I werent seeing things, please help us prove this. Sigthing July 27th,1999 time around 9:30pm-11:45 or so coming from the west, heading towards WPAFB. Let the truth be told. thank-you very much for listening to my sighting of some ufo's.

      "story": "Dayton, Ohio sighting The date of this sighting is approximate. It occurred late spring early summer when I was about 10 years old in Dayton, Ohio. We lived 2 houses West of Our Lady Of Mercy church. It was after dark and the family was watching TV in the dining room. I looked east out the side porch window and saw the craft. It was oval from what I could tell, with yellow light comming from what looked to be windows around the center of the craft. The craft was at 50'to 70' altitude judging from the tree height over which it was moving.The craft was at a distance of 150' to 200' from our house. I yelled for my family and they moved to the windows and saw the craft too. We then ran upstairs to get a better view of the craft. It moved slowly taking perhaps 20-30 seconds to move out of sight over the woods that bordered church property. While we were watching the craft a figure was seen inside who looked to be working controls of some sort. The figure was backlighted by the glow and I only was able to make out a dark human type shape. The following morning my brother and I went back in the woods where the craft had dissappered. About 200' inside the woods there was an area of crushed brush and even a couple broken saplings the largest being about 2&1/2 inches in diameter. This area was about 50' around, circular. And about 20'to 25' apart in the center there were 4 holes. These holes were about 3\" wide and 6\" to 8\" deep. For several years following this sighting very little grew in the crushed area, and what plants that did grow there were sickly as was a tree that was on the edge of the area. No sound was ever heard from the craft, and though the outline was rather vague due to the darkness, There was no sign or visible means of propultion, and a absence of any engine sound.

I was woke up about 430 Am to come along with my mother so she could drop my father off at work. In the car was my sister my cousin whom was spending the night with us that night and I. We took I-75 back home as usual because my father worked 15 min away from where we lived. While on the highway after you pass I-70 But befor you get to benchwood rd exit (note Benchwood rd exit was not there 10 yrs ago)I notiched an circular oval shaped object hovering around the highway ligts. The ufo was very close to us and I could not beleive my eyes. It continued to circul the lights in rapid movements. The ufo flashed with lights that circled around the whole center of the craft. They were multi colored I remeber it was blue and red colored lights. As we passed the craft I looked back and continued to watch it untill I could no longer see it. I asked my cousin if we really just seen a ufo and she replied yes in a creeped out way. What i belive the ufo was doing was getting energy from the lights on the highway to help power its craft. That is what I beleive. I live 10 min from the wright pat airforce base and I came up with a theroy that maybe its a top secert craft they created that can spy. I have allways told everyone about this encounter but never thought about reporting it till watching shows on ufos. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We stood on an access road by a large grass field and treeline at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton,OH. About 5a.m., we observed three white vapor clouds rising from the earth, as if evaporating. From a distance; they would have been inconspicuous, but clouds do not take independent trajectories regardless of wind direction, not to mention the clearly visible rotating bands of white lights in each cloud. A very  low-flying plane passed directly overhead, with a very odd  paint scheme, and a very odd metal framework of objects affixed to the underneath, so much that there clearly was no way landing gear could function, had there been any. Directly afterwards, three vehicles drove by us, one a white van w/ two men that followed us to our job, came in one hour before we opened, then a man phoned to offer us a \"cab ride out of there\" We were followed everywhere by white vans for weeks, then two vans came to my house to \"work on\" the utility pole in my yard. No utility companies I called knew anything about it, and when I went out to speak to them, they asked me about ufo's.",

It\u2019s 1997 now, but in 1994, an incident occurred. This has been occurring to me lately, I saw a, lets say, UFO.  Im from Dayton, OH, but I was in Fairborn, OH, this particular day It was around 12:00 noon, full daylight, little clouds in the sky..  I walked out outside of a apartment complex, mind you id been up since about 9:00 am, as soon as I get outside, I noticed a round, rather large object sitting in the high air, hovering.  A friend was with me but I was so attached to the object in the sky, I wasn\u2019t able to say anything to him till it was all over.  I continued walking and starring, after about 8-10 seconds the object ascended, or rather departed farther into the sky.  Estimating another 5-7 seconds to depart.  Now this is the reason why I believed what I saw.  Not only a full beautiful day of sunlight, hardly a cloud in the sky, but... As the object departed, whatever part of the sky this is actually visible, (I\u2019m not sure if our own space shuttle does this, I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t think so) I noticed I could see a distortion around the object.  Simply I could see black around the departing object, rather the distortion allowed me to see, without the blue sky, right into space, or rather the point of leaving the atmosphere allowed the, or didn\u2019t allow light as normal.  I cant really explain, but my brain, or rather I would have never have thought of that occurring. The process that took place I\u2019ve never considered.  I believe what I saw only because of the sunny day, perfect vision, not really, the distortion around the object as it departed, like I say, I could not have conceived the Idea of what I saw.  I, in general do not think of this memory, vary rarely, but an idea popped into my head to write and send to , somewhere.  I don\u2019t expect belief, anyone can say anything, I would like an explanation of a similar distortion that occurs as an object departs, or it only happens under certain conditions, as I explained.

The event I witnessed last Saturday morning was disturbing. An employee and I were standing in the parking lot of my business chatting. It was a bright sunny day with spotty high clouds and a very light breeze. I noticed a large number of small clouds suddenly form in the sky to the north just below the upper cloud level.Curiously, these small clouds started traveling downward in an arc. Other small clouds appeared behind the first, and more behind those, forming a steady stream of clouds. Three larger clouds appeared. These cloud objects traveled across the sky in a straight line formation to a point overhead and remained stationary during the entire event. The steady stream of smaller cloud-like objects continued their downward arc at a slowing rate of speed. As they neared our position, the mist surrounding these objects began to disappear, revealing shimmering egg-shaped objects. The skin of these objects were a bit translucient. As the objects lowered in altitude further, this skin became completely transparent. The objects reached treetop level just over our heads, traveling at a quick rate of speed, approximately 50 mph. Hundreds of them passed overhead. The outer skin of these objects appeared to be a membrane of sorts. Inside this membrane, another object appeared. The inner object was a segmented globe, much like a soccer ball. The outer skin of this object seemed reflective--reflective not of the sunlight but of the sky around it. Struts or wires or something protruded from the bottom of the globe to a pointed horseshoe shaped thing with bright silver flashing lights on the underside. These lights flashed in series from the rear of the object to the front. After passing over our heads, these objects headed skyward. They disappeared at a point just below the cloud level.",

So right around 12:45 tonight I was driving south on I-75 in downtown Dayton, OH just north of the I-35 changeover when I saw something in the sky over Dayton.  I was looking out my driverside window towards the city, which would have been directly east of the city.  It was an elongated triangular shaped object, seemingly delta shaped, which was either glowing or reflecting a bright yellowish white light.  At first glance I thought I was seeing moonlight through a break in distant clouds but quickly realized that the body of light was moving. It was traveling southbound with me and without immediately considering the details I just assumed it was a particularly visible conventional aircraft, but it's odd shape kept my attention.  With only my own perspective to judge from I couldn't accurately determine the objects distance from me and therefore couldn't figure its speed or altitude but after watching it for a couple minutes I realized that it was either much too large and traveling much too fast to be anything conventional or it was flying much too low over the city.  Within a few minutes I was taking the 35 East exit and at this point the shape was south east of the city. Around this point it split into two lights, one was directly above the other.  The bottom of the two lights seemed to have a slight red hue and the top was a pale white.  About two miles onto I-35 the lights were directly south of me and as I drove east the two gradually disappeared into the south.  By the time I reached Keowee St. they were no longer visible.",

      "story": "Large meteor passes earth Time: anywhere between 6:42 - 6:44 PM Eastern Standard Time Location: Dayton VA, 22821  Did the world nearly end while I was enjoying a smoke?   At around 6:40PM Eastern Standard Time, I went outside to have a ciggarette.  A few minutes later I looked up about 15 degrees west of overhead to see what looked to me to be initially, a bright moving star. It was too far away to be an aircraft and was obviously both too high and moving too fast.  It was about as bright as Jupiter in the night sky its color was white with a very slightly yellow tint giving off a near constant light, but dimming as it approached the horizon.  I remember distinctly that the object was moving faster when it was over head, than when it was off closer to the horizon.  The object dimmed in a regular (almost linear) fashon. The path of the object started from about 15 degrees west from overhead, and continued to about 45 degrees over the southwestern horizon before fading away.  The whole occurance occured over about a 15 second long period. I thought to myself; \"what if that's an asteroid?\"   I thought this was potentially accurate because typically meteors move faster, and are only visible when they burn up in the night sky, and usually they leave a streak.  This was just a bright object like a star. Leading me to infer that what was producing the light was was reflection from the sun.  I wasn't sure exactly how big an object had to be to reflect an amount of light bright enough to be mistaken for a bright star but I assume it has to be at least 30 feet in diameter.  So I believe the object was rather large, perhaps as large as a plane or maybe much bigger. I supposed it might be the International Spacestation. But from what I know the spacestation moves in a roughly opposite direction from the object I saw. The object was heading almost exactly southwest. What I can also infer from my observations was that the object was moving tangentially with respect to the Earth. This would explain both the slowing of the object as it approached the Southwestern horizon, and it would explain the behavior of how it faded away (because it reached an angle with respect to me where the suns light no longer reflected off the object). The arc length was approximately 30 degrees, maybe more from when I first noticed it. And the whole event lasted about 15 seconds. Given my observations, I can conclude that in all likelyhood, the object was not an asteroid but it was probably (though not definately) a large meteor. This conclusion is based upon the theoretical limit for meteor speed, which is roughly 160,000 miles an hour plus or minus 3,000 depending upon its relation to the rotation of the earth at its surface. This theoretical limit itself is based upon escape velocity, or velocity at which objects would not be pulled back in from the sun's gravity. Not much more can be inferred from my observations without making assumptions because the exact trajectory (particularly along the y-axis {the axis perpindicular from the ground to space}) can not be known. If I assume delta Y is 0 (which it must approximate to by about plus or minus 30 degrees) then a rough approximation of its distance can be calculated. From my observations I know the arc length was approximately 30 degrees over a period of approximately 15 seconds. My initial reports were inaccurate both in its trajectory and in the angle to which it faded. After revisiting the scene I can say with some certainty that the object disappeared about 45 degrees above the horizon (not 20-25) and started about 15 degrees from directly overhead (or from when I first noticed it). Because the object did not appear to burn up or leave a streak, it is safe to infer that the object did not burn up in the atmosphere meaning it was at least 62 miles above me. *62 miles is the approximate distance from the surface of the earth to the outer edge of the atmosphere given the two constrants (maximum speed limit of a meteor and the minimum distance from the surface from the earth, I can make rough approximate limits of its size and speed. Assuming the smallest possible size of the object (in order to be able to produce that light) is a sphere 30 feet in diameter. Assuming delta Y of the meteors trajectory is 0. Assuming delta X is 30 degrees. Assuming maximum velocity is 160,000 miles an hour. *http://www.amsmeteors.org/fireballs/faqf/ Assuming minimum distance is 62 miles. *http://www.universetoday.com/25410/how-far-is-space/ Assuming delta T (or change in time) is 15 seconds. Assuming the meteor had to be at least 30 feet in diameter. (at a distance of 62 miles)  Calculations suggest the distance of the meteor could have been anywhere between 62 miles and 958.27 miles away.Based on assumptions the size of the meteor was 30 feet in diameter at a distance of 62 miles, the maximum potential size would be 463.68 feet in diameter, and it would be traveling at a speed of between 10,351.92 miles an hour to 160,000 miles an hour. If the absolute maximum assumptions are taken to be true, then it is possible that a small asteroid passed earth. But given how unlikely that is, it is probably more accurate to assume it was probably between 100-250 feet in diameter. It is also probably safe to assume that the object was larger than the minimum. Due to the unliklihood that a meteor was going slower than what is generally observed with meteors. The range of speed of meteors almost always ranges between 7 and 45 miles a second  *http://science.howstuffworks.com/question486.htm. if the minimum distance of 62 miles is taken to be true. the speed of the meteor would only be 2.87 miles a second. Judging from this, the distance was at least 151.22 miles away and was therefore it can be assumed that the object was at least 73.17 feet in diameter. So did the world nearly end? No in all likelyhood not.  Even if the meteor had hit earth, it wasn't nearly large enough to be able to cause serious damage.",

My friend and I decided to take a flight to Indiana for dinner, and were departing from Dayton Wright Brothers Airport around 1900 EST.  There were three people in the airplane. Two of us were pilots with around 100 hours, and one other person who was not a pilot.  As we took off and turned towards the proper heading we notice three bright lights off the left wing south of the airport.  At first glance we thought it was a large jet then we noticed there were not any position lights, beacon, etc., and the craft was entirely too low to be a craft of that size. As we paid more attention we noticed there appeared to be three different craft in a tight formation.   This gave us the last clue that these craft were probably not anything we\u2019ve ever seen before.  Flying in a tight formation at night is dangerous, and keeping it that consistent would be nearly impossible. We were climbing out of three thousand feet and I would estimate the three UFOs were at one thousand feet above the ground.    As we looked down on the three craft they seemed to cycle positions in the formation, cut hard to the left, and took off over the city.  All the people in the plane lost sight of the craft at this point.",

The entire parameter ((sic. Perimeter)) of the craft was outlined in bright white lights.   It was hanging low in the sky and was immobile.  One flashing white light was pointed towards WPAFB and was blinking on and off.  I could not detect the color of the craft as it was dark outside.  It almost looked like it was black or invisible but could detect an outline; like black against a black sky.  The circular craft had a half circle bubble on top of the circular base and that also had lights around the parameter.   I pulled off on the Harshman road exit and pulled my car into the Riverside police station for a better look.  It was hovering right over the overpass very low to the road.  I rolled down my window and could not detect any noise.  I was surprised that no one else was pulling over to view this strange craft as it was so low to the road and very out of the ordinary.   It was about five minutes since I drove upon the craft and pulled over that the craft very slowly descended into the base area until I could not see it anymore.  I relayed these events to my friend and she posted this to her facebook page asking if anyone else saw this.  Two other people wrote back stating they saw the same thing around the same time.  Not sure if this was some prototype from the air force base or if this was something else. Did not see any other airplanes or other crafts around the craft. I will say that twenty years ago when I was ten years of age, I saw an identical looking craft above my old house that was located ten miles from the sighting previously stated.  It was around the same time at night.  It had the same blinking white light that flashed into my bedroom blinking on and off for ten or fifteen minutes.  The blinking light made rectangle shapes on my bedroom walls.  I brushed it off as car lights until I noticed the blinking lights weren't stopping.   I looked out the window and saw the same circular craft with lights around the parameter (sic.  Perimeter) hovering very low to the ground not making any noise.  It frightened me and I ran and told my parents.  Of course, it was gone by the time they came to investigate.   I wanted to mention this older past experience as the craft of Sunday's experience was identical in appearance and behavior.",

      "story": "Texas, 1989, Orb in upper Earth atmosphere--ridiculous movements--impossible speeds I\u2019m way late on this one (1989), but just became a believer 2 nights ago when I happened across a documentary that covered \u201corbs.\u201d   We had explained the sighting away and forgot about it. A buddy and I were 16 years old and camping about an hour east of Houston, Tx (5 miles north our tiny home town).  This is cow country, quite rural and remote, especially back then. There were four of us, but the other two were sleeping.  It was a cloudless August night.  We were enjoying some the stars (and his Dad\u2019s beer we stole) before bed. We were facing south toward the Gulf which is an hour\u2019s drive from there.  I noticed an airplane drifting from Houston (west) toward Beaumont (east). I remember saying something like \u201cthat must be a military jet; it\u2019s way up there.\u201d  It was perfectly silent, so that made initial sense.  This area is a flight path for the Houston airports; we grew up there.  We knew what commercial jets looked like at night\u2014and you can definitely always hear them, especially in the still of the night. My buddy said something like \u201cit can\u2019t be an airplane, that thing might not even be in the atmosphere it\u2019s so high.\u201d  It\u2019s moving way to fast to be a plane. I suggested it must be a satellite reflecting the sun to us, but I had never seen one before.  So we\u2019re trading ideas of what we\u2019re looking at.  It appeared to be no lower than our upper atmosphere, but probably under the satellites.  Remember, back then there weren\u2019t many satellites. Maybe it was 45 to 60 seconds of watching.  Then it happened. This thing did something that was simply impossible.  It bounced up and down like a graph of a Cosmic Ray; high peak to trough in a relatively short space.  In about 1 to 1.5 seconds it must of oscillated 8 to 10 times.  Then it shot back in mostly the same direction it came from, maybe at a 30 degree angle over where it just came from (the west).  The problem is, it went from a nice slow visual pace to something near the speed of light. From the moment it quit proceeding to the East, it only took about 0.5 seconds for this thing to cover (I swear we\u2019re not crazy) many thousands of miles.  It appeared to be many, a great many, diameters of the earth. We had what I\u2019m sure is a normal reaction to this; we both shouted at the same time \u201cDid you see that S---T?!?!?\u201d That woke up the other two.  They were upset and accused us of being drunk.  We had each had maybe 6 beers.  We were weekend drinkers, so not really drunk yet. The other two stuck their heads out of the tent, but weren\u2019t interested in \u201cour prank\u201d until morning.  They never believed us, and I don\u2019t blame them.  We did get very drunk after that and stayed up almost till daylight trading ideas. Since what we saw was impossible, we settled on this explanation:  We were watching a satellite that just happened to quit reflecting sun light at the exact moment a meteor just happened to flam up and streak the other way.  A handy description I\u2019ve used is that it moved like the Star Ship Enterprise gunning it for \u201cwarp 9.\u201d  The bouncing around we dismissed as the initial explosion of the falling star. There was a very brief trail, but never since (I\u2019m 40 now) have I seen a falling star like that.  He and I started hunting at about 10-12 years old.  We had spent many and hour watching stars and falling stars waiting for the sun to rise.  Plus we loved to go camping.  We each must of seen 100 falling stars by the age of 16. My subconscious new it wasn\u2019t a falling star, but my conscious mind prevailed and I remained a non-believer for 24 more years. When I realized that someone video-taped something 98% similar (I never watch UFO stuff) I went into a light case of shock as my mind considered the ramifications. I\u2019ve picked up quite a bit of physics and theoretical physics since 16.  My guess is this thing wasn\u2019t from outer space, it came from hyperspace (5 or more dimensions). I went from making fun of guys like you to instant belief.  Sorry I\u2019m a quarter of a century late with this one LOL.  I hope this helps someone. Dan  P.S. I\u2019m holding off until my Christmas visit back home to show Don the video-got to see his reaction in person! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I went inside and grabbed my wife, who also saw.  She proceeded to call her parents and brother, who also all saw the lights. The lights were extremely high in altitude, very fast, and ranged in colors of white, blue, and red. Several of them flickered.  I think the color difference could be explained by differences in altitude. After roughly 15 minutes of watching, I saw three all moving at the same speed in a staggered triangle formation.  Already in amazement by what I was seeing, a much larger, deep red light followed those three. At first, I was waiting to see if they would fade from view at about 30 degrees as most satellites I have seen do.  The only time the lights faded was when they were so distant I could no longer see them, but never did they flicker out like satellites.  Living near Wright-Patterson, I am not entirely surprised to see things like this, but they were definitely not aircraft that the public knows about.  None of the lights changed direction, seemingly all having a set destination or orbit. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "Orange orb of light making no sound observed by two individuals On the night of July 28th, 2013, my husband and I were sitting in the driveway on lawn chairs watching the Aquarid meteor shower.   There were a few clouds to the southeast, but it was relatively clear across the rest of the sky.  There was a light breeze and no moon, and it was quite cool for the time of year.  We hadn\u2019t been out long when I asked my husband where the binoculars were, which he said he would get them.  I spent a few moments looking at Mars and Saturn and a few deep sky objects.  Shortly after 10 PM I decided to put the binoculars back in the garage, and just as I turned toward the door I noticed a bright orange ball of light coming up over the southern horizon traveling east.  I pointed it out to my husband and asked what it was.  At first my mind tried to make sense of the sight, thinking it was a helicopter or plane on fire, but it made no sound at all.  After a moment I realized the binoculars were still around my neck, and I looked at the! object, seeing only a perfectly round ball of deep orange light.  The color flickered like a flame into different shades of orange, but it remained constantly lit.  It never blinked or made any sort of pattern.  It was hard to judge how big or how far away it was, but it was slow-moving and appeared to be low in the sky, its path a relatively straight line.  I handed the binoculars over to my husband and ran into the house hoping to get my camera ready, but by the time I made it back it had disappeared.  It just \u201cfaded out\u201d as my husband described it, and he wondered if maybe it just disappeared behind the clouds, so we went up into the yard hoping to see it again, but we never did. I have been stargazing since I was a child, and I know what jets, helicopters, satellites, and meteors look like in the night sky, and this was none of those things.",

      "story": "Very large white saucer, chased by B-52 near Wright Patterson Air force base. UFO REPORTING DOCUMENT  First, I was informed of your website by an older broadcast of Coast to Coast. Now this event happens many years ago, but I believe it is still note worthy. Now this was my first encounter but not my last. I had two more sightings about 10 and then 12 years later. But that is another story. Now a brief background on location and time frame.  Now the sighting.  It took place in late January or early February of 1968-or 1969.  I had just received a telescope for my birthday (01/18).  I don\u2019t remember if it was my 12th or 13th birthday.  But at that time I had know knowledge of UFOS, and this memory has been burned into my brain for over 45 years.  You already know that I live in Dayton, Ohio.  At that time my house was as the crow flies about 5 miles from Wright Patterson Air force base.  Now this was the time when Wright Pat was still a SAC base.  We had B-52s Fly over the house every day.  It was there approach pattern for landing.  Sometimes so close off the deck you could see the rivets on the plane. The sighting took place between 11 pm and 1:00 am.  My friend and I were out in the backyard with my new Telescope.   Directly due east there was a very large, almost pure white saucer-shape craft.  It was hovering on the horizon at just above tree top level. That would place just east south East of Wright Pat.  It was moving very slowly, heading South East.  Now it was big, hard to judge size, but at least as long as a football field maybe bigger. It was as bright as the brightest full moon you have every seen.  Except three very light gray porthole looking discoloration marks on the bottom.  These were evenly spaced.  Now here is the kicker. Just as we saw this object, a B-52 comes flying over the house with its landing gears down.  It is on final approach, most likely not more than 1000 feet or so off the deck.  It just clears the house, landing gears go up and it powers up.  Let me tell you know it when a B-52 starts to accelerate.  Now there approach pattern was at a North East heading.  This B-52 banked hard and tried to get up behind the craft.  I don\u2019t know how close it got maybe a mile or two.  The B-52 is behind the craft just as it disappears behind some trees.  We run down to the corner of the block, it appears the B-52 is closing! than ZIP the craft went almost straight up and out of sight in about 2 seconds. B-52 fly\u2019s around for 15-20 Minutes.  Then it is gone from sight.  The next day in the Journal Herald news paper there was a small paragraph saying about 200 people reported an unidentified object in the sky.  I have never been able to find this report going over micro film.  But it is hard if you can\u2019t nail down at least a pacific week or so.

I followed it off the freeway and the object appeared to have a faint white light behind it.  It was fairly close to us still as it moved away and then, within 20 seconds went very fast away going very high upward until it was no longer visible.   While it was over the freeway, it seemed to be hovering or staying in place for a second.  As it went away it moved at a very very high rate of speed and climbed vertically.

      "story": "Formation of at least 9 flying vessels flying a unique precise pattern and flight path. Circular/Crown Shaped Last Saturday about 6:50pm (1 December 2012) I was leaving home heading to a local store to get in a few lottery tickets.  No sooner than I had came outside to get into my car.  I looked up into the sky as I noticed a light being emitted from some type of flying craft.  I was thinking that one seems a bit unusual as it turned and went out of view. I thought to myself, I wish I had my digital camcorder or something.  I felt as though I had missed a chance to obtain a nice shot of a UFO. Just as I got ready to get into my car, I noticed three more of these objects, first there was one, then two, then three.  I paused for a moment took out my cell phone and captured a still photo image of the vessels. I was able to capture all three in the frame of my cell phone.  As they went out of sight I got into my car backed out of the drive way made an almost immediate right turn and headed straight down the street. I noticed there appeared to be more objects approaching.  They also went as far as the others and turned into a right bank and out of view.  By this time I was wondering if more were coming as I had already see at least four. I slowed down my car reaching for my cell phone again and started taking photographic images.  I pulled over and stopped on the right hand side of the road. I managed to capture a couple more still images.  Then I slipped my phone (trail and error) into video mode and managed to capture even more evidence of this rare event. The first video displays an object approaching as if it is coming up out of a cloud and it makes me wonder if there was a mother ship over top of the cloud and obscured from sight.  In the first video it is so short that you can barely see the lead UFO moving.  However, I filmed a second video which was about 52 seconds long.  This video clearly shows at least three of the objects coming from the same direction and approaching my direction but off to the left (drivers side of the vehicle). I was able to capture some of the objects approaching and observed them flying the same pattern in the same formation as the rest. All of the objects that I could clearly see, looked the same. The bottom was a bright fiery color and was circular. Now that I think about it, it reminds me of a crown. The top portion of the vehicles was darkened into the night sky and they were all seemed to be hollow at the bottom and with an intense uniform fiery glow. These vessels seemed like their power source was centered at the bottom of the crafts and circular. In the first still image that I captured you can see a portion of what I described as crowned.  I did not note any navigation signaling lights and this is clearly displayed in the video I was able to capture. I did not bother to call the authorities or the local Air Base as I have already been there and done that years ago. I figure they are not going to tell me anything, at least not at this time. I would like to state that I would love to be working for the Government in this line of work. I do have experience as a Police Officer and was called to a UFO seen way back in 1983. This is the first time I have ever been able to capture UFO footage. I have lived around Military Installations my entire life and I have flown overseas three times. I see many aircraft around here and the all fly with navigation lights and these objects did not. I would estimate that there were about 9 - 12 uniform objects that were involved and in plain view. It is like they just rolled in and the airspace and sector was all theirs. I was so busy focusing on the UFOs and trying to obtain photographic evidence, that I didn't even pay much attention to the normal aircraft in the area.",

      "story": "9-12 objects in apparent  formation black and firey orange circular on bottom/photos and video captured Last Saturday night (1 December 2012) shortly before 7:00pm, I was leaving home to go to a local store on Valley Street to purchase some cigarettes and play a few lottery numbers.  This store is located in Dayton / Riverside Ohio, and very close to Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  Dad is currently buried at the local VAMC and is retired Air Force. When I stepped outside and was going to get into my car, I noticed a strange object flying overhead and breaking into a turning pattern to the right and upwards movement.  I thought to myself how odd and I wish I had my digital camera. I thought oh well, it is gone and I missed my chance to get it on tape.  No sooner than that happened and I was getting into my car, I noticed that there were three more of these flying vessels identical to the first. (All of these objects seem to have the same flight path / plan).  At this time I took out my cell phone to try and capture still images or video.  Oddly enough, I was able to capture a photo of three of the objects in one still frame photo. I thought to myself, oh well at least I got a still image photo and will look at it later.  I put down the phone and backed out of the drive-way, pulled forward and made an immediate right-turn and proceeded to travel down a street that I drive down everyday.  Oddly, enough I didn't get very far and I observed more of these strange looking vessels coming my way.  I slowed down to a stop on the right side of the roadway and started capturing what I could on my cell phone again.  This amounted to a few still images and a few short segments of video. Once the last one went by, I called my mother on my cell phone and told her to go outside and look up to see if she saw a UFO.  She did, but was unable to see anything.  She stated that it was cloudy outside.  From experience I know these objects do become obscure by clouds sometimes.  Even in the video footage that I was able to capture, clouds can be observed in the night sky.  Another strange thing is that there seems to be a moon like glow coming from over top of the clouds.  Therefore, it is possible that there could have been an obscure mother ship in the vicinity. I could tell these UFOs were not regular jets as the lighting was different looking.  There were no airplane lights mounted on them blinking at all.  There is always aircraft in this area and you will see their lights twinkle when flying over-head, or off in the distance. NOTE: The objects were dark on the top and firey orange and circular on the bottom.  The power source seemed to be coming from the bottom area and you could look up into it and observe a circular pattern.  The objects appeared to be some type of circular shape.  It is so astonishing to look at something for such a brief period of time and try to rationalize what you are looking at.  I am so use to the after-burn being on the back-end of a flying vessel that it was very puzzling. Strangely enough during this event I did note other regular jets flying at much higher altitudes but off to the far right and left sides of these vessels.  When I think about it all, it makes since that they would break off.  This is a populated area and I think it would be very bad to intercept or try to intercept these objects over our cities, unless we had no choice. This is just my opinion and is based on what I observed.  I can't say what the military or civil agencies had up and flying in the area during this time.  I did not contact anyone at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, been there done that.  I have been involved with UFO Research off and on since 1983.  This is the first time in all those years that I have been able to capture photographic images. I did some brief internet searches utilizing key words pertaining to what I witnessed and the first search turned up positive and interesting results.  I am submitting this report to various UFO Agencies within the USA as they are trained in working with the Public and private citizens in this field of research. I am a US Veteran and if called upon to work with the Government, I would gladly do so and assist in anyway I could.",

We live in the northeast portion of Dayton, OH and on the evening of 31 Dec 13, I went to take out the trash at 10:00PM and noticed a line of lights moving fairly low over our neighborhood and my property.  We had a broken cloud deck at between 1000-1500 feet and these lights were clearly visible so they were below the clouds.  There was a ragged string of lights, 12-15 in total, bright orange-red, in a ragged line moving from S-SW to N-NW, TOTALLY SILENT when they went over our house, so I know they weren't powered aircraft or helicopters.  Balloons?  Hardly - they moved too fast.   The group of lights at the head of the line seemed to stop and some of the followers caught up and then the line began to fade out.  The last lights in line were over our house and you could see that they were  climbing up in altitude into the cloud deck.  Total time was on the order of five minutes.  I called my wife to come out and take a look; she saw them and went back into t! he house to get her camera, but she couldn't get any shots of them - just points of light to the camera optics.  First time I've ever seen anything like this and I know what I didn't see - no airplane, no helicopter, no balloon.  I\u2019ve got several degrees, my first is a degree in aerospace engineering and I\u2019m also a retired Air Force pilot, so I think I should be a credible witness.",

      "story": "UFO near Air Force Base. On Monday march 31, 2014 in Dayton, Ohio, my wife and I were cooking out in our back yard on a very clear night.  We were both sitting at our table in the back yard when all the sudden a very bright orange light moving very fast with what looked like bluish streaking light coming out of the back of it appeared in plain sight and stopped suddenly. The craft was very close to the ground, I'd say about 500 feet and maybe 5 miles from us.  At first I thought it was a meteor or large shooting star but when it hovered for about three to five minuets I knew I was looking at something out of the ordinary.  We live very close to Wright Patterson Air Force Base so I thought maybe they were doing something like they do, secret, ya know?  But as my wife and I watched it fly away rather slow, I noticed there was no Air traffic in the sky at all.  We took a video of this and watched it twice but, then the video just corrupted itself.   We then noticed Jets taking off from the Air Force Base (two that we seen) as the craft dissipated into the distance going from South West to North.  The Jets we witnessed turned their lights off at what seemed to me to be about 500-1000ft First Jet turned off its lights, then jet #2 did the same. I called 911 to make a report but they did not take me seriously.  I've never believed  in Flying Saucers of believed in UFO sightings but, what my wife and I seen on March 31, 2014, was real.  It was not a fleeting glimpse of something strange.   We seen something very much unexplainable and I think what ever it was, it spooked the Air Force Base by our house!",

The reason being, I like to investigate with nothing less than pure skepticism of my own eyes/thoughts, and try to as thorough as possible before I make a claim as something being unexplainable or being a \"UFO\". 2:30am, I see this yellow/orange, orb/ball of light floating fairly low on the night sky.  I was thinking Jupiter, which I know was visible this night (Venus as well).  I did all the research I could, pictures, astronomical star/planet arrangements for given time and date.  The research kept leading me to convince myself that it was indeed Jupiter.  My gut was saying otherwise.  This object was relatively large compared to any star or planet ive ever observed with the naked eye.  Within the first few moments of observation I had to keep refocusing on this object.  It appeared at times humanoid in figure (arms, torso, head), \"divine\" dancing light if you would.  Other times not so much, I rode it off as deceived perception.  Then I kept seeing a flash of light over the right shoulder of the object and this too, rode off as a plane heading to the airport.  Then I saw the flash again, and again, and again.  That's when it really didn't feel natural.  Even if the flash of light was a satellite in fixed position, why was it fixed, was it keeping an eye on this thing?  At the least it was only a satellite interested in this object as well, if not it was from the object itself, either way I don't know.   I know that it aroused me enough to call up a friend near by to check it out as well.  Unfortunately I don't have a camera phone/camera but I did sketch it on the computer with paint.",

Directly outside of my window (within a foot of my eyesight), I saw a yellow round circle roughly the size of a baseball.

It is so specifically green and blue it takes my breath away. This is towards Fairborn/Huber Heights possibly the Wright Patterson Airforce Base?

      "story": "Apparently two round objects conjoined or one object comprised of two parts. This is going to be one of the more unremarkable sighting reported to you, but I felt it worthy of sharing just the same. On Sunday evening, 24 September, at about 8:30 PM, my wife and I were returning home from a restaurant when we observed an object in the sky traveling from approximately west, 15 degrees south toward the east, approximately 15 degrees north. The object appeared to be comprised of two white lights connected to one another and moving at a speed of approximately 5 arc degrees per second.  I have no idea as to its actual speed since I was unable to determine its altitude. What I am reasonably certain of is the object was not an aircraft since there were no blinking lights, no red or green lights marking the wing tips, just a solid white light. There were high clouds present in the sky and our view of the object was blocked as it moved over the clouds.  I would estimate the altitude of the clouds to be approximately 15,000 feet. The object emitted no audible sound as it passed us overhead. We did observe an aircraft to our east, moving from the south, approximately 15 degrees west, toward the north, approximately 15 degrees north, which is the direction we would surmise as an aircraft going from Atlanta, to New York City.  Given the aircraft we observed at the same time was likely traveling at ~30,000\u2019, the object we observed also appeared to be moving at the same rate\u20145 arc degrees per second. My first inclination is to surmise the object we saw was the international space station, but I hadn\u2019t heard any announcements of its presence in our area, which is the usual case on our local TV stations, but if it were the space station there is one curious matter remaining unsolved:  When the object we observed reached a point where it was some 30 degrees above the horizon, it was no longer visible to us.  It seems to have disappeared at that point. While I will not discount the possibility that the object was blocked by some clouds we could not see, or that it might have been blocked by some other atmospheric phenomenon, the fact that it disappeared from our view is what has prompted this communication. If you do think we were looking at the international space station, I would appreciate your letting us know. Thank you!",

      "story": "Near Dayton OH red-orange object in night sky I'm nearly 40, with a doctorate degree and a former university-level research assistant to a professor of astrophysics. On this night, ny father was sitting outside on our back patio in the dark, only a porch light illuminating the area.  My mother and I were indoors, talking, sitting at the kitchen table. That room has windows which face north, one of which overlooks the back patio.  That window was partially open, as was at least one other. At approx. 9:48 pm EDT, my father shouted something unintelligible (to me) through the open window nearest the table where I sat inside the house.  My mom understood what he'd said, telling me of my father, \"He's demanding I come outside!\"  After that, I heard him as he continued yelling to my mom to come outside \"right now\" to see something. I will outside, instead, anticipating an announcement to the effect of, \"There's a skunk in our yard! (There is long precedent for this sort of statement).  I walked to the door, and as I crossed the patio toward my father, he pointed toward the sky (it being nearly entirely dark, this was not terribly useful and I did not even know he'd done until I saw a photo taken that night).  I asked where to look, and then he explained to me where to look in the sky:  toward the far northwest to the west side of a large tree in our backyard. Once I turned  to look in that direction, it was easy to see the object to which what he'd been referring.  It appeared to be quite large, utilizing nearby homes and trees as a point of reference, and was a vibrant, brightly-colored object which appeared nearly round in shape.  It seemed to glow, and that glow was quite intense, the entire object a uniformly-brilliant red-orange and lacked any discrepancy in intensity over its entire visible surface. It appeared to be relatively large, greater than the size of any plane (civilian or military) I've yet to see under similar circumstances.  It appeared, initially, to be flying a bit lower than even the typical passenger planes which I see daily as they fly to and from a nearby airport.  The only crafts I've seen in such a low flight paths have been F-15s & F-16s flying during either the local, annual air show, or else flying in and out of nearby Wright-Patterson AFB. This red object moved quite rapidly, heading east with its initial path seemingly parallel to the earth.  After about 30 seconds, it disappeared from my view as our backyard tree obscured my line of sight entirely, then returned to view.  When it did, it appeared to remain moving forward from West to east, still traveling parallel to the ground for about ten seconds.  Then, it suddenly appeared smaller (from which change I'd generally infer either a change in size, luminosity, or distance from the point of observation, but whatever occurred did so seemingly instantaneously). Then, still appearing smaller, the object apparently gained altitude, rising from  a former point about 35 degrees above horizon to ~45 degrees above horizon, and then, at zenith, the object seemed to cease moving completely.  It did not move nor vary in size or light intensity for several seconds, then began moving in a manner completely different from how it had moved before stopping.  It repeatedly moved in what appeared to be a linear, upward direction perpendicular to the going (without any associated forward or backward motion), did the same moving downward, eastward, westward, or at varying angles; it seemed to move closer at times, farther away  at others, each of the perpendicular motions made occurred without the object also moving in any direction parallel to the ground, yet other  times it moved forward (west to east) or backward while apparently accelerating or decelerating.  It also would simply cease moving and remain static, as well as move in sharply curving and angled paths as it appeared to simultaneously move up or down. It remained the same shade of glowing, vivid reddish-orange throughout, its light initially seeming to vary in intensity relative to its distance from me, but after the first 60 seconds or so, these changes in light intensity seemed to lack any correlation with the way it appeared to move. It was during the sequence of rapid, varied movements that the object again appeared to completely cease moving, and, while remaining stationary, appeared to divide into two of itself, yet both objects appeared identical in shape, and color/luminosity.  There was no visible division of the first object; it simply appeared to change from one object into two, the second appearing (at first) as if conjoined with the first object, as initially, a small portion of the edge of its upper left (west) quadrant appearing to either overlap or be contained within the edge of the lower right (east) quadrant of the first/original object.  The only visible sign that accompanied the appearance of the second object was a quick, less-than-a-second, flare-like emission from the lower-right (east) quadrant of the first object; this quickly-appearing and quickly-fading flare was the same color as the object itself.  The second object appeared nearly identical to the first/original, except it appear! ed to be slightly smaller.  The second object remained visible for only a second or less; it then vanished entirely, without any apparent movement at all. The original object remained, now alone again.  It remained visible for ~90 seconds more after the second object disappeared, the original resuming its prior series of sharp, quick motions (without any apparent pattern or sequence) alternated with seconds of apparent non-movement. It had been visible for 3-4 minutes when it again appeared to stop in place, stationary, then its light intensified as it appeared to increase slightly in size (perhaps it was moving closer to me).  Immediately after that, at an incredible speed, the object moved silently to the east, then appeared to gain altitude at this same, ultra-rapid speed (closest to which I can compare its speed is to that of a meteor streaking across fhe night sky) as it moved east-to-west at quite a steep angle, although it did not move in a straight line as it did so.  It never ceased that motion, but once it reached its highest point, it moved with the same sort of extremely rapid speed toward the east/southeast before vanishing, seemingly among the clouds in that direction. Whether its motion was linear or otherwise, each motion of the object was quite fluid & it always appeared to move with a noticeably agile ease.  The object seemed entirely silent throughout.",

I was finishing a walk of the block with my dog and was thinking about walking her a bit farther down a street running to the south so turned to look down that street and noticed the light from what I assumed was a plane flying high above treetop level to the south. Living in one of the flight paths sometimes used by the Dayton International Airport, I didn't think much of it until I realized (as I waited for my dog to finish sniffing the ground) it didn't appear to be moving either horizontally or any closer or farther away.  I watched the light and there was only a solid, steady pale orange glow -- the blinking lights I anticipated would appear never did.  Maybe most noticeable was the total absence of sound that always accompanies the aircraft I see at this approximate distance.  I did see a flight cross in the distance from west to east, its lights appearing smaller indicating it was probably either smaller or farther away than whatever it was I had noticed! which remained stationary as the aircraft passed behind it to the south; the aircraft was easily identifiable by the blinking of its lights.  The brightness of this light varied just slightly in intensity, getting a bit brighter or growing more dim for a few seconds.  The color remained the same.

The lights would change from red to green to blue and, whenever I would see an obvious airplane in the sky near it, the lights would change to a bright white.  Once the aircraft was beyond a certain range, it would go back to the r/g/b rotation.
