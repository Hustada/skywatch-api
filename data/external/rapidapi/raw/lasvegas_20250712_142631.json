      "story": "crossing moon, disappear, reappear, hover then takeoff  ((name of observer deleted)) UFO sighting and filming 3/18/2019 522pm Las Vegas, NV, Sahara Blvd between Ft. Apache and Durango,  The Lakes Business Park   So I was watching the moon and noticed hey the moon doesnt look right with this warping quality.  The moon appeared to be peeling and shimmering at the edges sort of like how hot blacktop distorts what you see with the heat convection, but in a way that made me uneasy.  So I thought hey maybe I should see if my camphone can capture what I was seeing.  I zoomed all the way in and aimed the camera and found a steady position and this took around 30 seconds to prepare.  Video quality was junk because my phone wasnt created for long distance zoom but I pressed record anyways.  The only object in the clear sky that I could see with my camera up to that point was the moon, but as soon as I pressed record, literally within milliseconds of activating the record function, this tiny white dot appeared traversing in front of the moon.  I held my steady position suddenly full of excitement that this could be a UFO.  I couldnt actually see it with my eyes but the camera picked it up fine.  This thing is obviously high altitude.  At first I thought it was a huge coincidence that I basically got ready to film a UFO without knowing it.  Sent me for a loop.  Distance was very difficult to determine but whatever it was it was definitely very high altitude.  Difficult to not think it was actually at the moon itself, but if it were at the moon it would need to be exceptionally bright and large to shine through the daytime blue sky. UFO?  Plane?  The ISS?   The recording is 48 seconds long.  The object approaches the moon from the right at around 51% up from the bottom of it in a straight line with a slight descent and then disappears.  It then reappears hovering for a fraction of a second on the left side of the moon inside that darker area as though it materialized out of nothing.  You can clearly see it didnt fly straight through solidly, the contrast of the dark patch on the left side of the moon makes it easier to see.  It then continued its path in the same direction behind the bare branches of the nearby tree.  I filmed it till it left my line of sight. It appeared to pulsars somewhat and with the lower resolutions you can see this pulsating more clearly.  I rewatched this Video a hundred times and truly its easy to obsess over because they I filmed this thing and its exciting.  My camera phone is a plain common android smart phone, nothing fancy.  I am sending you the whole 48 second video.  What I already posted online is a shortened 10 second version. I have seen It is of various sorts several times before. Last ones were 2015, 2 in 2014, here in Las Vegas, a whole bunch of them in 2011 and 2012 in Los Angeles and first one was 1994 in Oregon when I was a young kid.  This would be my first actual filming of a UFO in my whole life and funny that it was fully through chance and coincidence and perfect timing. I tried reporting this on the MUFON site but there is an error and forms cannot be submitted. I also tried sending the whole video but since it is 100.38MB and my email limit for attachments is 24MB I decided to upload it to Vimeo and peovide the link.  If You press the gear icon on your Vimeo player you can change the quality to 1080p. Vimeo link:  https://vimeo.com/325153051",

While looking up at the starry nite sky, noticed a single orange or amber light, traveling SSE at unknown speed and altitude.  The object appeared to the northwest of our position and traveled silently over our heads to the Southeast.  It was on a steady course and did not blink or vary in intensity.   It remained visible on a steady course for about 10 minutes.  It appeared to be a dim amber bulb but did not flicker.   No strobe, no red or green position lights, no flame or noise like a hot air balloon burner.  No shape was apparent and it was traveling solo.

Above the houses I noticed what appeared to be an oval shaped ring in the sky. All I could see is the outline, which was bright, and nothing inside of the oval. After a while (45 secs maybe?), the object begin to travel south (to my left) staying at roughly the same altitude. As it moved forward and to my left, it would advance and then double back slightly. It did this 4 or 5 times, and then stopped in midair. It began to grow in size, and I realized that the object was getting closer. Not willing to put myself in danger, as I was the only one around that I could see, I went inside. I came back out a few minuets later, and it was gone. I live in the flight path of both an air force base and an airport, and I see helicopters and military planes all the time. This object did not have any running lights like you would see on a helicopter or low flying plane, and it was all one color, a yellow orange glow. The object did not change its orientation to me much. The ring was thickest at the bottom left corner (to the north), and was thinnest at the top right corner (south) the object had two clearly distinct circles or spheres on the bottom left hand corner of the ring. These looked like beads on a necklace, and I could tell the object was facing me the same way because the circles stayed in nearly same position on the ring. I tried to see how big it was, and the ring would fit inside of my little finger. There were other aircraft, in the vicinity, but they did not seem to be chasing the object. If anything they were flying the flight path to the airport. I was the only one that I know that saw the object, and I have never seen anything like it before. I did not hear any sound nor were there any weird effects.",

There were four short grayish aliens with large black eyes and no mouth. One held my left hand by my fingers, one had my right arm pinned down, and two were holding my ankles. I tried to yell but it was as if my own mouth was gone: I could not open it. I raised my head and tried to get away. Then I saw an image on the wall that caused me to pause: it looked like a microscopic image of blood cells and amoebas moving. I looked at it briefly then continued to struggle. Then I felt as if one of them pushed my head down, and all went dark for a few seconds. When I felt them release me, I saw them move to the outer wall as a bright light shown through the window. I jumped up to look out but the aliens and the light disappeared.",

While I was sitting a light caught my attention, I thought it was a plane, but the longer I looked at it, I realized it was just a solid white light moving slowly.  It was moving towards the southeast.  As it continued on its path it slowly disappeared as if it turned off the lights.  When I looked at my friend she had noticed it also!  She\u2019s a flight attendant and for me I\u2019m a student pilot, we noticed that it didn\u2019t look like a plane or a drone. we\u2019re not sure if it was a meteor, if it was it was the slowest one I\u2019ve ever seen and it didn\u2019t leave a trail like a shooting star.  Hopefully some else caught this!!",

My eyes are drawn to something out of place in the sky above sheep mountain. I stare at the light for a moment, trying to tell if it is a star or not, and then it starts to \"zigzag\" in a diagonal direction towards the desert floor. upon completing several complete zig-zags, it shoots off and does a very hard bank upwards in a vector seemingly aimed at a point very high in altitude above the test site. This is the first \"white dot/sphere\" I've seen above this area of town.  It was difficult to tell the distance this object was away from me, but I would guess it was over the very forward edge of the restricted airspace in front of the Nevada Test Site and the other military instillations located behind Sheep Mountain  Also, immediately after the light disappeared, I noticed two (airforce?) planes with very powerful strobes fly along sheep mountain towards Nellis Airforce Base.",

It somewhat resembled a searchlight spot but, again, movement and rate of speed seemed inconsistent with that type of light.   Searchlights usually occur repeatedly over periods of time.

What I'm really trying to find out is if you hypnotize because I feel I'm missing something, but maybe I'm wrong. I was 7 months pregnant and got up to take a water pill.  I noticed it was very light outside my kitchen window.  I thought there must be a full moon.  As I sat my glass down on the counter the room began shaking.  I had been in aftershocks before when I lived in California and I thought I had experienced a small quake. I started back to bed but then I heard the noise.  It was a humming like telephone wires, but more insistent.  I checked the oven and the refrigerator but couldn't find the noise. Never mind.  This is going to take all day and I already tried to send you a report on e-mail that didn't go through so I've already written this once and don't want to do it again. Suffice it to say I watched this craft for some time, even walked over to the fence, but it has a strange ending.  I went back to bed and didn't remember seeing it until months later when I went to my surprise baby shower.  My friend had just read a book on flying saucers and when she said the words \"flying saucer\" I blurted out my story. I didn't think I had missing time but perhaps I may be wrong and since I'm not getting any younger I thought I'd talk to someone and see if it was worth pursing from a scientific angle for information.

I went out to feed the horse at about 6 or 7 pm - Feb.? 14? 1997 - and looked up to the sky. It was a cripsy clear calm night with cotton ball clouds. I could see the stars behind the clouds. The lights of the city were slightly illuminating the clouds. Suddenly I saw one ball of light pass above the clouds moving in a South-Westerly maybe more Southerly direction. It looked odd so I kept watching. Then another ball of light exactly the same size and distance moved the same direction following the first, completely silent. I kept watching and there was another and another. I ran in to get my video camera and started taping this. There were several more. They seemed to be spaced the same distance apart and travelling the same rate of speed, like in some kind of formation, though the patches of clouds made it difficult to be exact. My first thought was that they were satellites, but then do satellites travel in this manner? I've seen many satellites before, but these were closer, or a lot larger-if they were out in space! These balls of light were about the size of a small green pea if you held it in-between your forefinger and thumb in an out-stretched arm. I think I counted about seven to ten seconds between each ball of light. Also, they just seemed too perfect for shooting stars - and there were too many of them. I saved the tape it's on (I hope!) Though I only got the last few of the formation on tape. I have other family 8mm tapes I've been meaning to go through to put on disc. Hopefully, I'll find this footage. When I do, I'll send you a copy. I've seen other unexplained things in the Nevada sky, and yes I've seen F-117 and the B-2 bomber, both stealths, amoung other military jets.

While on the job (which requires both witnesses to be outside for several hours) at approximately 19:55 PM, I noticed at a medium altitude a strange pulsing red \"dart\" (I've seen plenty of F-15s, F-18s, even B-1B Spirits while on the job due to the job's location under an Air Force flight path, and this seemed like a military airplane with its lights on) fly at an abnormal (faster than Air Force aircraft normally fly in the area) and leave a strange fog behind it (looked like a vapor trail but was highly visible against a dark sky), and I point this out to the coworker next to me.  He sees it, and we talk for a moment about it, then he turns, yells and points to the moon, upon which I see a white dot of light accelerate from in front of moon north towards the Nevada Test Site.  After traveling several degrees in the vision in just a second or so, it had accelerated to the point it was no longer visible. After this I began marking times using a function on my watch, and at 8:06 I noticed another one of the red darts. During the next hour the sky around our job is filled with air planes and helicopters deviating from the normal flight path into North Las Vegas Airport to circle around the area. When I leave the job for home at around 22:30, I check to see if my laptop (which I don't normally leave in there) was okay, at which point I find the backpack and the laptop to be both hot to the touch (I've never had this problem before), with the laptop already fully powered on. The laptop has only an effective battery life of 70 minutes, and was not at full capacity the last time I used it, which was around 18:00.  Out of curiosity, I touch the back of my hand to the car stereo, and it is also hot to the touch. This is not the first time I've seen \"white spheres\" or dots over this part of the city. In fact, this is the third time in less than a year, but the first time I reported the incidents.",

I was on my lunch break from a class talking to my wife on the phone in my car when I spotted out of the corner of my eye what at first I thought was a skydiver as it looked to have a falling motion. I worked at an airport where they have skydiving and have witnessed jumps from the ground view several times. This was a little different as it looked way to high and was moving to slow. At first I was thinking maybe it was a military drop of some kind. I was on the phone so I did not give it to much thought but then it stopped moving all together. I asked my wife to go outside and see if she could see the object as well but she was several miles away and I could not point it out to her in the sky. As I was trying to tell her which way is North it started to move again. This time instead of the falling movement it began to climb and move to the East. At this point I asked my wife to go inside and do a google search for someone to call about something like this which she did and is how I was able to call you immediately after the sighting. As she was giving me your number the object once again stopped. After about a minute in which I was trying to tell my wife once again where it was with no avail it began to move again. This time it moved to the North West and at a very fast speed. It quickly disappeared out of sight. I got off the phone with my wife to call you but noticed two of my class mates looking up in the same direction. They where returning from lunch and saw me looking up in the sky. They spotted the object as well and witnessed it from the first time it stopped to when it disappeared. They both have agreed to give their names if needed. My phonecall with my wife lasted 20m 43s so the entire sighting lasted for a good 12 to 15 minutes. Like I said I worked at an airport and witnessed planes, helicopters, weather balloons and skydivers and this was definitely not any of those things. I am not sure what it was. I am not saying i! t was fr om outer space or aliens or anything like that.

Two of my friends and I were laying on my trampoline in my backyard around 1:20 AM in Las Vegas, NV. We were talking and just looking at the stars when I noticed this odd formation of lights moving across the sky. There were three clusters moving together- the main cluster was a V shape and the two other clusters were slanted lines coming from the sides of the V\u2019s. They seemed to kind of float like a sting-ray would underwater. I pointed the lights out to my two friends. I pointed out that it was coming from where \u201cArea 51\u201d is supposed to be and one friend also pointed out that it was moving towards Nellis Air Force Base.  Soon after, an airplane left McCarran airport and we compared the two. The UFO was completely silent and seemed to float and flutter while the airplane made a lot of noise and the body was completely visible. Both objects seemed to fly at the same pace and altitude. About a minute after the airplane went by, I noticed another UFO flying a very similar route as the first, except this UFO had no lights and was seemingly transparent. At times it was a dark brown/green color, but mostly the same shade as the night sky. When it flew over stars, it was more visible and the stars seemed to change a little bit. This UFO was going a bit faster than the first and was also completely silent. Unfortunately, only one friend noticed it when I pointed it out.  Friend A, who saw both crafts, believed the first UFO was one object. I, however, believe the two smaller clusters (both made up of about 3 to 4 lights) were just flying extremely close to the main cluster- as if protecting. The cluster to the right seemed to be a little behind when I first noticed, then sped up a little- as if to catch up with the other two crafts. He hadn't seen it before that moment, but has researched UFOs for some time.  Note: At my location, the routes of the crafts and of the airplane that left McCarran airport would intersect, making an X. Hence, they flew from and towards different directions.",

While unloading my shopping bags, I heard a helicopter in the distance. After a few moments it was within view. The only thing obstructing my view was the roof of my house. The helicopter then cleared the roof and continued moving southeast. At this moment in time,I was returning for my second trip to the car for the last of shopping bags. The noise of the helicopter was loud enough, to make me look again. I looked towards the helicopter and spotted another flying object near the helicopter. There was no noise from it, as far as I could tell. The helicopter continued moving southeast until another object appeared about 200 yards ahead. I say \"appeared\" because I did not actually see the craft arrive at that point. I was still focused on the first object; the second craft fell into my view as the helicopter moved into the space. At this moment my wife was also starring at this strange sight. She said she was wondering what had grabbed my attention.I explained to her what I had seen so far. My daughter then came outside where my wife told her to look towards the sky. Craft 1 started to pulse from a dull yellow to a color of that from a BMW headlight, a bluish-purple.Within a few seconds Craft 1 left at an unknown speed heading north. This is the last I saw from Craft 1. While Craft 1 left the helicopter was still heading souteast and Craft 2 was now about 100 yards away. At this point I believe the pilot saw this object. The helicopter quickly, sharply turned due east towards Sunrise Mtn. The Craft hovered for a moment while the helicopter continued moving.The Craft then got in front of the helicopter, again baout 100 yards. I did not see the craft move as I can describe it is more of a blink and then it was there. At this moment I was aking both my daughter and wife if they were seeing what I was seeing. The helicopter quickly and I stress quickly; turned head directly south. I saw the tail of the helicopter whip around and a higher exhaust note from it. The helicopter continued moving south with its nose down,tail high moving fast. The craft at this point moved along the side of the helicopter still 100 yards away. This mirror image of the craft and halicopter lasted about 10-15 seconds. The next thing that occured was that the craft stopped and redirected towards the north. It moved slowly at first and zoomed away. The craft were long about the same size as the helicopter. The pulse affect of the craft was as that of a squid when it is under stress. The speed was awe inspiring. There was no known sound if any coming from the craft. The helicopter was not a police or military aircfart,it seemed to be a medical helicopter.",

I saw the lights of Las Vegas reflect off bottom [no lights on ufo at all]. As it got past the south limits of the city] about Sloan area] the object disapeared because of no more city lights reflecting off bottom.  I remember seeing the same object in an online ufo picture taken in Las Vegas in about 97'. I thought that pic was a hoax and obviously the Sanyo blimp. I realize it was the exact same thing I saw.  I've heard of the USAF flying new stealth craft over Las Vegas to test radar reflecting, but, this does not make sense. During Leonid showers more people looking at sky and this craft clearly reflected the Las Vegas city lights and thus was very visabile to anybody who happened to be looking up at 4am.

My first thought was that these were random pieces of paper caught in the updraft of a while wind (or dust devil). I have witnessed this before. These \"papers\" were very high in altitude, and hardly visible.  Then I looked back at the 10:00 position to watch the Thunderbirds do a low altitude pass over.  As I was eating I looked back to the 1:30 position to see these objects slowly moving to the NE, and I noticed that there were 6 of these objects; the thought that these could be geese flying back north, and I wondered if there was any danger that the aircraft could hit them.  I observed the objects for about 20 seconds, and noticed that the were not flying in any formation and there movement was very slow to the NE. My eyes went back to the 10:00 position, the Thunderbird were doing their 4 aircraft going vertical and spreading out at the apex of their climb, and noticed that the objects were in the same area of the apex of the aircraft. I quickly looked back to the 1:30 position and nothing was there. Then as I looked back, the objects were closer together, moving up and down slightly, and then proceeded to travel to the NW until they went out of sight.

Colors were red, blue, green, yellow and orange.  While it appeared to be stationary over the two hour period it actually gradually dropped from about 30 degrees to about 10 degrees above the horizon.  I thought it might be a satellite but after checking the orbit speeds and trajectories of the Hubbell satellite and the International space station, it was easy to rule them out.  I also checked \"stationary\" weather satellites speeds and orbit and ruled them out.  Whatever this was, it had to be outside the earth's atmosphere and did not appear to be orbitting the earth.  I have never seen a celestial body that had distinquisable lights rotating around it like this object.  If you know what it is, can you tell me?  I have attached 3 photos I took of it with an inexpensive digital camera shooting into the eyepiece of a $100 telescope.  The photos a a bit blurred and the light streaking due to vibration of the telescope.  But at least you can see that there IS Something there and that the colors described a true.

Im 49 yeas of age and  I have live very close to Nellis afb for the past 15 years. Within the past 5 years I have been a regular night sky watcher . While things have been real slow the past 2 years ,it certainly was not the case 3-4 years ago . But I still take time to view at least once or twice a week .That being said , While laying on my back looking and scanning skyward ( I use nite vision due to so much light pollution here and I have managed to darken the street lamps around my location ) expecting at best to view a few satellites or un explained light movements since it is extremly hard to distinguish shape and form at the usual distance I encounter as  I work the sky  in quadrants I was totally taken back when from the NNE I caught the outline of a V shape closing in. At that initial distance I thought it was a repeat of the diamond formation of four indivisual craft That I viewed 3 years earlier ,As it became closer I realized it was a single craft, very large, how large I cannot say as I had no reference pointsbut easily seen with scope  sillouetted against a las vegas night sky . B-2 was a quik second guess as it had more ov a delta shspe but this was quickly elimanated as it passed directly overhead it was more delta shaped leaning more to a boomerrang -V shaped another thing that i found aerodynamically strange was one side being slightly more elongnated than the other, there seem to be darker pod shapes under each side (wing??) still no lights and no sound and no contrails of any kind and was not on a glide slope of any kind as it was definitly under its on power. Also never has there been any commercial traffic use this path that I can recall in all my years here . Its speed seem to be at a pretty good clip my guess is at least 400 knots but hard to say as I had very little reference points as to size, height  only that it covered f! rom my i nitial sighting which was approx 20 deg above the north horizen (darker sky & better viewing) to where I lost sight as it approached the more lit up sky over the strip approx 11 mi away in about 40  to 45sec . Ive seen many strange sights in the late nite early morning skies here bbut not much to speak of in the 2 years until this nite ..And it was good enough to make me want to write this and send for the first time . I have seen some interesting things with multible sightings on many occasions here and would gladly elaborate if interested fill free to contact me via email  ((e-address deleted))",

We came to a corner and we stopped to look at the constellation of Orion\u2019s Belt and not even 10 seconds later we both saw a dark triangular shaped object slowly floating right below the constellation with anywhere from 5 to 8 small dim lights that formed a V shape.   The lights appeared gold at first but as it went away they appeared almost blue.  The size of the lights were comparable to that of the stars in the sky. The object was about 2 to 3 inches in size in the sky.  The sound that came from the object was a low pulsating humming sound.   The object was headed south and it looked as if it broke it pieces for a second but then it was definitely intact, when it made a sudden right turn to the west and then rolled over and went to the southwest and was suddenly out of sight but we could still hear its distinct humming sound.   We turned around and ran west down the sidewalk and turned left(southwest) onto the next street but we would not see or hear the object after looking for about five minutes.  During all this we seen many planes in the sky and that made it easy to compare the characteristics of the object to the planes.",

At the point where the planes were turning I noticed a small object, that I initially thought was a balloon, coming towards the strip.   In less than 5 minutes from when I spotted it, the object slowed down above the Wynn golf course area. It stayed in this area for about 5 minutes.  It was not stationary at this point, but moving slowly westward. It then started picking up speed and moving in a north westerly direction and was out of my site in less than 5 minutes. It was barley visible as it left my field of view from the hotel window.  From the point that it slowed down, I had a decent view of the object as it was directly in front of me.  It was fairly high up, but well under the cloud cover.  The object appeared mostly white with a patch of darker, gray on it.  It seem as though it was probably the size of a car or van. The shape was not perfectly round; it seemed as though it was more pyramid shaped but very rounded.  It also looked to be rotating.  I am not sure what it was, but I could tell that it was not a balloon. It was not bobbing with the wind and the size was much too large for the height that it was at. It was not a plane as it would have dropped out of the sky as it moved slowly over the Vegas strip area. There were helicopters flying well north of the object and were clearly visible as helicopters.  It was not an object I could identify and I did have a fairly close and clear view of it.",

During the evening hours on Thursday, Sept 27, 2007, at about 2000 hrs, I was working as a security officer in downtown Las Vegas.  About 50 feet to my right, two Las Vegas police officers had someone in custody, possibly for illegal drugs.  My eyes were directed upwards and I observed an aircraft streaking overhead.  The flight pattern resembled a conventional aircraft, but this aircraft was a perfect triangle in shape. I have never seen a triangular shaped aircraft.  The next day, my friends told me that it was probably the latest in Stealth technology.  This craft had three lights, one at each end of the triangle and one light in its mid-center.  I glanced toward the police officers, and their attention was also directed towards the object.  One of them said, \"Wow, look at that\".  They then turned back to the subject they had in custody.  As the object passed, two very bright white lights were flickering at the rear of the craft.  I don't believe I heard any noise emitting from the aircraft.  I am not able to accurately describe the size of it or how high it was in the sky.  I was not able to confer with the two police officers about further descriptions because they were busy.",

It was parked between two mountains where the road intersected it, just floating in the air.  It looked exactly like the Haiti UFOs seen the same weekend.  It was practically silent except when I drove under it I could hear a constant whirring noise, just a few decibels above my car noise with the window down.  I thought it was a weather balloon or some advertisement until I realized (when I got far enough away to see it in my rear view mirror) that it was no longer there and secondly when I saw the Haiti videos.  I could not see the engines since I was in a car and my view above me was clipped, and since I was driving up a hill when I saw it head on it was only the metal that I saw.  It was on the same scale of a car or two length.  I thought it was much further than it was until I kept getting closer and the scale changed.

After about 10 minutes of watching, the bright light below the balls started moving away from them to the west.  At this time I went inside to get my camera but I am very slow moving because of a broken leg.

They moved higher and further south slowly.  I tried to take some photos with my Kodak Easy Share C340.

I consider myself a sane, common knowledged person, with some experience in aviation and military aircraft.  I fly often and have seen every commercial aircraft as well.  I have witnessed flares used in military training exercises, I have seen reflections of lights off clouds and windows (glass). I was an amateur astronomer and have seen everything from meteorites to the space shuttle in orbit. I have seen hundreds of satellites.  While I have witnessed other very impressive UFO's with multiple witnesses, this was different from all the rest. I have never officially reported a UFO Sighting until now.  I was looking from the 20th floor of the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas towards the direction of Area  51. I was also overlooking the Las Vegas Airport late at night, as I usually do when I visit that city. Suddenly out in the distance, beyond the mountain range a \"BLUE ORB\" rose into the sky at an unbelievable speed, it did not travel in a straight direction at any time, it continued to fly erratically throughout the hour I stayed awake to watch it. This BLUE ORB would rise to, my guess 50,000 feet, and dive back behind the mountain range within seconds. The speed of this object far exceeded any military plane I have ever seen and could not begin to imagine that it was a manned vehicle.  It did appear to fly within a limited range and distance, as it did not approach the city, nor did it seem to fly far into the distance, but rather kept its location above and beyond the Nevada mountain range. Furthermore, as planes could be seen approaching from the distance, this BLUE ORB would disappear behind the mountains. I felt as if \"it\" was being tested with caution. What I mean is the orb would disappear when a commercial airplane was near and the orb would reappear when the skies were clear of visible traffic. I'm confident the skies above our US testing sights are secure, and air traffic above them is forbidden.  This object had no defined shape other than a Blue Ball of Light. It did not flash, it did not change color, it made no noise I could hear, IT DID FLY AT INCREDIBLE SPEEDS. IT MOVED BOTH IN \"S\" PATTERNS AS WELL AS STRIGHT AND ERRATIC. IT WOULD SOMETIMES STOP SUDDENLY, HOVER AND DIVE, AND SOMETIMES IT JUST DARTED AROUND SOMEWHAT UNCONTROLLABLY. WHILE I WAS FASCINATED, THIS ORB WAS COMING NO CLOSER AND I FELT THAT WHAT I SAW WAS ALL I WOULD SEE. I DID CONTACT HOTEL SECURITY IN THE MORNING AND THEY TOLD ME THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. Of course, I did not have my video camera and I stand alone as an Eye Witness.  Thanks for listening.",

      "story": "Red light/sphere seen over neighborhood of Charleston Heights with street lamps blinking on and off. This is something I have lived with for many years and was too afraid to ever write it down. I've only discussed it with the people involved and a few trusted people in my life. When I was about aged 13 this event occurred. I had been in my house one night while my parents and other family members were out, it was about 8:30 to 9 pm during the summer in the early 1990's I remember watching television and the power suddenly went out.  I was feeling very uneasy about being alone in the house in the darkness so I decided to go up the block to my friends house as I figured they were not doing anything since the power was out.  My friends came outside with me in their front yard and we were sitting on the block wall talking for about 15 minutes when suddenly the street lights on our block had started to blink on and off.  We thought it to be strange as all the lights were blinking in unison with each other yet the lights within the house were not blinking.  Usually the lamps warm up before they reach full brightness after sunset or when recovering from a power failure.  I had climbed up on the block wall to look over into the other neighborhoods to see if the! streetlights on other streets were blinking as well which they were not.  It was only the ones on our cul de sac. Suddenly coming out of the east very high up in the sky we all observed a red sphere or ball that suddenly stopped and hovered above where we were standing yet it was very very high up and hard to judge exactly how high it was or its size.  The street lamps were still blinking on and off in a Morse code fashion.  After about 2 minutes of this object hovering above us it suddenly took off toward the west which was towards the direction on Red Rock/Spring mountains.  We were baffled, yet we slowly realized between the street lights blinking and this object that we had just witnessed a UFO.  My friends parents were also not home that night.  No other neighbors came out to where we were.  It was the strangest incident in my life. My friends siblings who had staid inside the house had reported that when they were trying to contact their parents on the phone that the phone ! suddenly had when static and they had heard a strange whirring noise d uring the same time we had witnessed this event.  Now these children were strict a Mormon family that were quite average and good people that usually would not believe in such a thing, but were convinced and still convinced they had seen a UFO to this day.  The whole incident was strange.  No parents home at wither home, power going out for about an hour, street lamps blinking on only our block, and this very bright red sphere high in the sky moving at speeds beyond aircraft that we may know of.  We believe that it was trying to communicate with us, or it was studying us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Amber orbs of light above the city of Las Vegas. On March 17, 2003 (St. Patrick\u2019s Day), I was in my backyard in Henderson, NV., a suburb of Las Vegas.  I was doing some star gazing with my Celestron telescope.   Sometime after 8pm, I saw a horizontal row of lights hovering about the Las Vegas strip.  They were an amber color, almost iridescent.  I thought they were lights on one giant aircraft.  They were spread out like what appeared to be several city blocks.  Then they disappeared, all almost at the same time. I stood there for several minutes in awe, trying to comprehend what I just saw.  Eventually I went back to my telescope; however I kept looking around the sky with my eyes.  A few minutes later, I saw three lights again, this time in a triangle formation.  It was at this point that I figured each light must be its own craft.  I ran in the house and grabbed my video camera as fast as I could.  I proceeded to record what I saw. I had to keep turning my eyes away from the camera screen, as the camera did not do justice to what my eyes could see (although the video turned out pretty good).  The bottom light disappeared, and then two more lights flickered into view above the remaining two, and disappeared almost as fast as they appeared.  Then the one on the right, to my perspective, disappeared about 20 seconds later. Finally, after about 30 more seconds the last one disappeared.  A few minutes later, one appeared again, and remained stationary for a few minutes before disappearing.  Before it disappeared, a regular plane appeared to fly by the object. I don\u2019t know if I should report the next incident as a second occurrence or not, but I saw another \"UFO\" 10 days later.  I happened to watch a show about UFOs where a man described seeing almost exactly what I saw, and said he saw them again 10 days later.  So, on a whim, I took my camera outside about the same time, 10 days later.  I was shocked to see another one, and I filmed it.  This second occurrence was strange. The light moved slowly higher and to the east.  Eventually, it turned from a large amber-like orb of light, to a small, strange, strobe-like light.  This was not like the strobe on an airplane though.  I have the whole incident on tape. After a few minutes, I saw two more strobe-like lights appear, near the same proximity.  It was almost as if the one was signaling the others, and they started to signal back. It was very strange to say the least. The strobes were very small, and eventually, I just couldn\u2019t see them anymore.  The second incident lasted approximately 20 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to obtain more information.  The video does, indeed, show the lights, precisely as the witness describes above, although we do not know what they are.  Ordinarily, we would allow for the possibility that they might have been landing lights on several airliners on long final approach, but they would not be visible for 30 minutes.  PD))",

      "story": "I told the 911 Operator that i was looking at a \"huge black triangle\". I am reporting my sighting now rather than when it occurred because i am much older and really do not care anymore what people think of me as far as being crazy or weird. This sighting was also called in to 911 dispatch as it happened, so there is evidence of my reporting it. This sighting occurred in the Spring of 1994... It was a nice evening in Las Vegas and my girlfriend and i had been hanging out in our apartment. We both smoked cigarettes and i had decided to go outside to smoke this time. We were on the second floor and it had a railing right outside of our front door and i leaned on the railing with my forearms and lit up my cigarette. I had taken a drag or two when i just happened to look up at the sky at my 2 o'clock position and saw this enormous black triangled craft float overhead approximately 2000 feet up.  The craft moved at a slow and steady pace from right to left.  If it had been a plane it would have fallen out of the sky.The craft made no noise and was PERFECTLY triangular. I yelled for my girlfriend Dana to come outside.  When she came out i pointed to the craft and asked her, \"what does that look like to you?\".  She replied, \"Oh my god, look at that thing, it's huge!\".  I was so shocked by what i was seeing that all i could think to do was run in, grab the wireless phone, and call 911. When the dispatcher came on the line i told her this, \"I can't believe what we're seeing, my girlfriend and i are looking at a huge black triangle floating over my apartment right now!\". The dispatcher, not apparently upset that i called, said, \"really?  You're looking at a UFO?\".  Something to that effect.  I told her i was not kidding that my girlfriend was right there looking at it with me.  I also told her i wasn't on drugs or alcohol or anything like that.  I was just witnessing an unidentified flying object. She told me there were no other reports of the craft and that maybe i should try contacting Nellis Air Force Base.  She also was genuinely interested in what the craft looked like and what it was doing. She never dispatched any cops or anything. My girlfriend and i then proceeded to watch the craft climb slowly up and away. The craft never made any sudden moves or turns or attempted to speed up until the very end of the sighting, it looked as if it was moving faster as it gained more altitude up and away. That's my story.  It isn't the most exciting, but it was a real triangled craft \"plain as day\" and there is a 911 call out there with my voice reporting it. I just can't remember the exact date.  But i'm sure there has to be a way to find the recording. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  Most 9-1-1 facilities recycle their magnetic tapes on a regular basis, so the recording probably has been erased.  PD))",

      "story": "See you later: appears to leave the Earth! I was living near the intersection of Washington and Rancho in Las Vegas, NV. I only lived there for about 2.5 months. I was renting a room in a house. I did not have a car, but I bought a bus pass to get around.  On many nights, I would leave around the same time, and take a walk to a local 7-11 store to get a soda or candy bar. It was a good half mile to mile walk. I occasionally would glance to the sky and look at the stars on my walks. One evening, I did just that, but this time was different. I noticed a real bright star that stood out from the other stars.  I was walking South towards Washington Street, but my head was facing to the West while walking (Rancho street), toward this object in the sky. I was looking at it for about 5 or so seconds, and all of a sudden it zipped at a 75-80 degrees using an acute angle. When I say zipped, I mean it appeared to leave the Earth within a few seconds (blink of an eye). I am not good with angles: so I will say it zipped nearly straight up.  It was too far away to describe what kind of object it was. I did notice a light trail that was whitish/blue that it left behind. This trail dissapeared within a few seconds as well, but gave me a good idea of its path. It was clear that this object (physical or non-physical) had unreal speed.  This incident proves to me there is either something else out there in this universe, or man has developed something amazing. I surely side to the former.

While driving w/b on Highway 160 out of Las Vegas I saw 2 lights ahead which I thought may have been landing lights on an aircraft.  It was very windy and the sky was completely overcast with low clouds.  As I drove nearer it was apparent the lights, which looked like white globes, were either stationary or moving very slowly above the highway, and they appeared to move apart as I closed with them.  As I passed beneath them, 6 very dim white lights became visible; four in a diamond shape between the globes (closer to the right globe than the left) and then two placed equally distant trailing west.  Unlike the two bright lights, the light from the smaller six looked indirectly lit, like distant windows appear in the nighttime.  The lights were then blocked from view as we passed beneath them.  My wife was with me but was not in the least interested and paid no attention to either me or the lights. Also, on the drive back to Tecopa I was astonished to find my night vision was restored--the halos I'd become used to seeing around oncoming headlights were gone and I could actually see the road ahead as headlights passed. It only lasted a week or so, but man was that a great thing.  I don't know for sure that it was associated with whatever it was I saw in the sky, but I do know that my vision immediately after I saw the lights was a whole lot better than before. I can submit a sketch of the lights' configuration on request, IF I can figure out how to load it into this computer.",

I would estimate the object was at 10 to 15 thousand feet in the air. This light had no strobes and was clearly not a commercial or known military plane, nor do I feel it was a meteor. I know this because of my background in A & P and the fact that the object quickly surpassed a commercial aircraft that was over 30,000 feet in the air (with the usual strobes). This light was brighter than the planet visible at that time in the southeast Las Vegas sky, as I could see both at the same time.",

My wife was resting on the bed.  I noticed a light from the corner of my left eye and thought that it was a jet landing at NELIS AIR FORCE BASE then I noticed a second then a third then maybe 4 or 5 more, but then I noticed it turning towards Downtown L.V. and that it wasn't planes of any kind and that it was huge, by huge I mean at least a mile long and I think about 4 stories high and it blended in with the night.  The way it turned or banked to the right I could tell that the lights that I saw where engines because of the way it was banking I could tell the shape and almost size of it.  I was out of my chair while it went behind Fitzgealds Casino for about 3sec. and came back into view going over downtown L.V. heading west slowly I felt like I could touch it but it was wishful thinking I guess because I believe in U.F.O.s since around 1953 when my mother and I first saw our first U.F.O. in Cleveland OH. off Lake Erie from Canada, but thats another story.   But back to Las Vegas, I was so excited that I yelled to my wife to come here quick which she did and I asked her to look out in front of her and tell me what you see and she replied something dark and looked smoky or misty like a silk sheet blowing in the wind. The reason I asked her what she saw was so that I wouldn't influence her in any way. The reason she didn't see the lights or engines was because the thing leveled off. To me when it leveled off it looked like some kind of cloak like on the t.v. show Star Trek. It went right over the Stratosphere Casio. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

About five years ago, I was on my way into my apartment complex, and in the parking area, a space ship pulled up, and hovered a few feet off the ground, at about thirty feet from me.  It had a large fuselage, and at the top, there were a wing on each side that came out from the craft at the top of the fuselage about twenty five or so feet, and then took a sharp 90 degree downward bend extending about 15 feet.  The fuselage was not round but it was more like a boat hull but not noticeably rounded at the bottom, either. From the bottom of the craft to the top of the fuselage, it must have been between about thirty and forty or so feet and it must have been sixty to seventy feet to possibly eighty feet in length. There was arching violet to purple colored electricity all over the hull and wings of the craft but particularly the wings. The electricity reminded me of the kind you see in a TESLA coil. I could feel, smell, and hear the noises of the exhaust gasses as the ship hovered. There was a hatchway, a debarking/embarking stairway passage door, and there was a man about six feet tall standing in the hatchway. The hatchway was at the bottom of the fuselage, and behind him, you could see a staircase going up to a higher deck inside the ship. He just sort of looked at me, and I looked back. I didn't act surprised, and in another instant, the ship zipped away. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Report is well written, but we wonder, nevertheless, whether it is a serious-minded report.  Genuine UFO's generally are not reported to have wings.  PD))",

As we were traveling north on route 95, we were driving about 60 mph and I observed a stationary light on the west side of the highway, about the height of one of the large powerline towers.   I thought to myself a powerline must cross the road there, and it was lighted for aircraft.  We were talking and driving, and as I approached where the light was (I could not see it without leaning foward and looking up) I noticed there was not a electical powerline tower there.  It was odd, and I leaned foward and looked up (as did my wife). We both observed a cylinder shaped object, about as long as a city bus suspended in air.  There was a window across the cylinder, and the window appeared to be at a 45 degree angle downward facing towards us.  There appeared to be a panel of somekind the entire length of the window.  There were figures seated at the panel across the length of the object, and what app! eared to be several figures standing behind them.  My wife and I both got the feeling the figures inside the objects were looking at us.  The interior of the object was illumintated, and we could see clearly inside.  As we passed, we were both surprised because the object appeared to be suspended in air.  I asked her if she wanted to turn around and go back, and she said yes.  I found a place to complete a U turn, and as we approached the object from the north a hundred yards away, it \"streaked off\" in a southeastern diretion towards Las Vegas, on an horizontal plane.  It rose abrubtly over a mountain, and then downward over the top...and disappeared.  From the time it started south, to when it disappeared was within a couple of seconds.

I was looking out the window and saw what appeared to be a craft with two very bright white lights (top & bottom) with a red strobe in the middle blinking about 4 times faster that the red light on the wing of our plane. It passed very slowly off the left side of the plane (approx 10 seconds from as far right as I could see to as far left). Then two more side by side (or could have been one above the other as perspective is difficult, passed below the wing. They seemed to be moving at the same speed and had same light configurations as the first. We were flying level at the time so i guess the first one would have been at about a 90\u2022 angle and the second two at about 65*. This too lasted about 10 seconds. I was trying to gauge the size of the lights as they did appear to be quite large. the white lights I gauged to be slightly less than a quarter of the moon that nigh and the red strobes were a bit smaller. Our altitude at the time was approx 37,400 feet and air speed was approx 550 mph",

This object then dimmed out and an elliptical object could be faintly seen for a brief moment as being of a very dull silver finish, it then immediately departed on a 45\u00b0 angle to the East at an extremely high rate of speed trailing a very very faint amber brown plumb behind where it disappeared in approximately two seconds. Ruled out a weather balloon, was not a meteor, had no strobe or red & green aircraft running lights, it emitted no sound.

Lake Mead Recreation Area  About 8-10 miles East of Hollywood Blvd on Lake Mead Blvd.   United Airlines/US Air 757,767, or Airbus, with Blue underside (body and engines), had departed McCarran IAP (3:15) Aprox. time 270 (west) making slow climbing 180 turn to 90 (east). I have been observing similar lights over the last two years in this area.  The lights have the ability to emulate small aircraft navigation/strobe lights (green/white and red).  When they are no longer visable from cockpit crews the lights return to their normal blury red/white strobe pattern.  I have never observed these lights mess with any commercial or conventional aircraft. The commercial flight is climbing out of Aprox. 17,500 AGL 90 degree heading East over Lake Mead and Est. airspeed at 275-325 knots.  The four lights are 1000-1500 feet apart two lead center with wing men trailing outside and Aprox. 500 AGL over Lake Mead.  The four lights have returned to red/white light pattern as the commercial flight passed overhead.  The Pilot/First officer probably requested a verification from Nellis AFB if they were painting any other aircraft in the area.   Whatever the communication, the four lights went from their position and elevation to the commercial flights elevation/airspeed/position in Aprox. 3-5 seconds and climbed out with them.  One lead light 500 meters off Captain's left window, second lead light 1000 meters off Co-pilots right window with the wing men lights 1000 meters from leaders and off commercial flights wing tips.   Whatever the circumstance it would be safe to say these two pilots probably needed to change their shorts.   This happened between 3:30-3:40 AM.    End of Report.

This appeared \"normal\" -- except I saw a lot of detail... a bright white light at the head with a green tail, headed East  Moments later, from the same general area where the first object faded, I saw what I thought was a slightly less bright red-tinted shooting star, heading towards the northwest.  This is when things got odd.  This second object slowed down almost to a crawl (still moving smoothly like a shooting star).  Never coming to a complete stop, it turned hard right, accelerated, and made a circle, spiraling inside the circle towards its center before disappearing. Do 'shooting stars' do loops??  Seconds afterwards, as I was attempting to begin to describe what I saw to my wife, two USAF fighter jets flew in a path that took them directly over my neighborhood, and  at a much lower flight level than I've ever seen out here. FYI I am on the far northern end of the valley.  To my East is Nellis AFB.  To my NW is the bombing range.  However these planes sure must have been in a hurry to have been flying so low. Afterwards, there was one more green colored \"normal\" shooting star which my wife did see, and a strange plane which was also flying fairly low but without sound.  It headed over the mountain to my North and then down the spine and over the mountains.  I have seen objects that look like stars initially seem to \"land\" behind this mountain on several occasions, but I have never seen a shooting star do a loopty-loop.",

I was heading East toward the Las Vegas Blvd. the road that I was on is probably 200 yards in length, it is a residential road. As I drove down the road, I was able to see The Stratosphere Hotel and Casino, this is a very tall building. nothing out of the ordinary at first as i turned onto this road that headed East. Maybe halfway down, I noticed a large sphere, golden and radiant, it looked like the light from a lighthouse shining directly at someone, but with a perfect bright sphere shape. This sphere was hovering in place perhaps 2/3s of the height of the Stratosphere building. slightly to left of the building from my perspective, which would make the sphere be on the North side of the building, 2/3s of the way up. I wasnt sure what it was and immediately it peaked my curiosity as soon as I saw it, it didnt really change in brightness from what i could tell, I was in a moving car. As soon as i got to the end of the street, i turned right (South) and the stratosphere was now being blocked by a commercial building across the street that i turned right onto. When i saw the stratosphere again, maybe 20 ft after made the turn, the sphere was gone. I also noticed a black helicopter heading toward the stratosphere from the North, and it looked like it was flying around the same height of where the sphere was. There should be a point made that there is no way that the helicopter could have been the sphere i saw, because the helicopter was MILES North of the Stratosphere, headed TOWARD the Hotel.  I did not see the bright sphere again. this was around 6pm, and in las vegas it is still very bright at 6pm, so it would make no sense for a massive light to just be hovering around buildings, especially that close to one.",

Near mile marker 31 I stopped and parked facing west next to a white gate on the south side of the road.  Immediately after putting the vehicle in park I looked out my front passenger side window facing north and watched 4 lights in a diamond shape configuration moving south in unison then change direction traveling east.  I noticed the time was 1:25am.  They were solid white amber lights facing down toward the ground. The lights did not blink or flash or change color. I stepped outside of my vehicle and watched the lights with a pair of binoculars and did not notice anything different as for changing colors or flashing lights.  I kept watching with and without binoculars as it traveled in an easterly direction.  Then as I looked again for it with my binoculars I noticed a bright flash of white light thru the binoculars.  I did not see the source of the flash or where it emanated from but it did appear to come from the direction the lights were traveling in.  I was unable to keep track of these lights because they flew behind the horizon of a hill about a \u00bd mile just to the north of where I stood.   My friend on the passenger seat observed the lights in motion and the sudden bright flash of white light.   I have been a outdoorsman my whole life and know this region very well.  I am very familiar with aircraft because aircraft is a hobby and so is the night sky.   There was not a cloud anywhere in the sky that night.  And I don\u2019t know what the heck caused that bright flash of light to occur.  It was just like a flash of lighting at night going off in the distance is what the flash of light resembled.   Even with binoculars I never got the impression or suggestion that \u201cahh\u2026its an airplane or a jet\u2026\u201d.   It was different and certainly something I had never witnessed before.   This great little experience lasted no more than 2 minutes.  After this occurred I got back insi! de the v ehicle and turned around to travel east to look for these lights about a \u00bd mile to a mile from where I was parked to get away from the hill that blocked our view and was unable to find these lights again.

He says that he can definitely tell the obvious difference between the plane and the orbs because of the landing/strobe lights on the bottom of the jet\u2014the orbs do not have such lights.  Plus the jet has an obvious light pattern as opposed to a solitary point of light like the orbs. He continues to watch until. . . 9:45pm\u2014Ok, now there are only 4 lights left. . . 10:27pm\u2014all the lights are now gone. . .

      "story": "The Vegas Lights Are Not From a Casino! There was an object over the skies of Las Vegas, in the the South East part of the city. The object appeared to have a saucer rim, which surrounded a sphere on the top and bottom of the object. This object performed several different aerobatic maneuvers that are impossible for any type of fixed wing aircraft. It hovered for periods of time, some ten to fifteen seconds. It moved on all three axes. It would move to the left and to the right, as well as up and down and backwards and forwards. I am a student with a passion for aviation, so I know that this could not have been anything civil or commercial. This object also emmited lights. It would be white for most of the time, but it did change several times, most notably in the spherical portions of the craft. IT would turn to like a purplish-pink color, and then back to white. I first observed this object when driving my car to the gas station, but never made it there. When there was a break between houses, and there was n a clear line of sight, I noticed a lighted object hovering near the South Point casino.  After a few moments, I realized that it was stationary. I pulled my car over and began to observe it for several minutes. It then started to move slowly to the left, then to the right. It began to fade, but then its color intensified. At which case I drove home. From there, my mother and my two cousins were outside, startled by the fact that there was an Unidentified Flying Object in our presence. It continued to change colors, and then fade as if it were shrinking. We continued to observe the object for ten minutes before it moved out o view. I am a nineteen year old college student attending UNLV. I also have a knowledge of aviation and astronomical phenomena. I do know that this was neither a civilian aircraft or an astronomical event. Also, this is not the first time I have observed a UFO. It has occurred two previous times, once in New York about eight years ago, and the other was back in March of 2008 by the UNLV campus.",

First he saw \"something\" and said - \"...what's that thing floating/flying out there?\"  I looked out the window - and didn't see anything - noting that we were close to the Las Vegas airport and just figured it was a helicopter or small plane.  About 5 minutes later I happened to look out the window and noticed a glowing \"ball\" of light and went closer to the window to get a better view.  As I focused on the glowing ball - I realized it was really a ring, glowing and it floated down past our window then actually floated across the hotel and disappeared.  I am not sure of the size, or even the distance - but if seemed to be around 8\" in diameter and floating just a couple feet outside the window.",

      "story": "Chevron-shaped flying wing with 7 large round white lights I was outside of the Aria Hotel & Casino at 12:52 am on Thursday morning, 4/29/10, looking up and admiring the enormous structure when movement in the sky above me caught my eye. I saw that it was a black flying wing/chevron shaped craft made of just 2 wings joined together at an angle of approximately 160 degrees. Each wing was a long narrow black rectangle; the \"wingtip\" edges did not taper at all and were squared off at 90 degrees, but with rounded corners. Arrayed along these wings were 7 round, white, non-blinking lights equidistant from each other and the front and rear edges, from tip to tip; the fourth central light was right on the central axis where the 2 wings would join (if they were separate pieces). The diameter of each of these 7 lights was approximately 50% of the width of the wing from the front edge to the back edge. It is very difficult to judge never having been close to the craft to get a sense of scale, but its size may have been as much as 180 - 200 feet from left to right, and it may have been traveling at an altitude of 1200 feet. It is also possible that it was a larger craft traveling faster and higher, or a smaller craft traveling lower and slower; at any rate the speed I observed it moving at was almost leisurely. Its direction of movement was due west, or with a very slight northwest component, and it was silent. It was in my line of sight for 3-4 seconds before it moved out of sight behind the roofline of the entrance to the Aria.",

      "story": "Multi colored, lighted spinning craft with greyish brown cloud surrounding it and bright white light over Henderson, NV. On 10-8-08 at approximately 0130 hours my girlfriend and I were walking our dogs at the park and I noticed what a clear night it was. I looked towards the South East over Henderson, NV and observed a bright white light which seemed to be moving slowly from side to side. The object was approximately twenty-thousand feet up in the air. I told my girlfriend to look up at the lights and we observed blue, green, red flashes as the object appeared to be spinning. We observed the object move very slowly in various directions almost as if it was floating around the sky over the Henderson urban-sprawl. The object had a brownish-grey cloud around it at all times and the light it emitted had illuminated the cloud around it, which seemed to follow it wherever it would go. We stayed at the park for approximately an hour, and marveled at what we saw and the changing lights. We decided to drive in the direction of it and ended up at a housing development near Silverado Ranch and Eastern. I believe it was called \u201cSouth Fork\u201d off Eastern Avenue. We parked in front of  various houses that were in the South East area of the housing development itself and it appeared to be very close to our vehicle compared to when we were at the park. It made no sound itself. We both stared at the lights which were still green, red, white, and blue at times, but it was mostly white and the colors would come and go. At one point a red laser type light emitted from the craft which seemed to be a smaller light than the others and a different color red that circled around the craft which was spinning. I told my girlfriend looking at the lights was becoming difficult because they were so bright it hurt and she agreed. I flashed my hazard lights, as we were in my vehicle, and when I did this on two occasions the lights became more active and the small red laser light would almost answer back to us and seemed to shine in our eyes directly! The dogs with us were whimpering and whining. The unidentified craft seemed to be getting c! loser to our vehicle. I was looking at the clock the entire time in the quiet neighborhood and I never lost any time during the sighting. At one point my girlfriend says it \"looks like a disco in the sky!\" She also described the white portion of the lights as \u201clike a starburst\u201c. I could make out the shape of the craft in only one instant and it appeared to be bell shaped, however the lights made the craft appear to be disc shaped and spinning. The cloud cover around the craft did not look like normal clouds almost as if the cloud was emitted from the craft. At the housing development we could hear helicopter sounds but we did not see any helicopters and I thought this was suspicious. This object was not a helicopter as it did not have small red flashing lights on the tail but large multicolored ones. During our sighting, we both agreed about what we observed and we shared the exact same reactions to the UFO at the same time. We drove up Easter, a little more South up towards the \u201cAnthem\u201d area, which actually is up the mountains of the Valley and parked. We could still observe the UFO from our vehicle however it appeared to be more East of us and also appeared to be rising in altitude slowly. We came to the agreement that we had actually driven around the UFO, which made me to believe the object was large however not very high in altitude. Other things about the sighting were we observed several shooting stars during this sighting in alternate areas of the sky than the UFO. At one point in the sighting we observed white beams shoot out from the craft. We also observed several smaller orb craft around the craft during the sighting. Because I did not know the exact distance of this craft it is difficult to say the size but I did get the impression it was possibly a mother ship as at about 0530 hours it was high in the sky and only white light when we got back to the house with the smaller craft possibly following it up. This craft seemed to be a pyramid shape at times as it gained altitude. This is my first UFO sig! hting an d we shared it together, as it was her first as well. We felt like we had a connection with it and hope others saw it that very early morning. We did not have a camera in the vehicle and we did not want to run back home to get one in fear we would lose track of the UFO.",

She pointed to the sky and asked \"What is that?\" Me and our friend looked to where she was pointing and saw a round object floating across the sky. It was flying very high, but below the cloud level.  I ran into the house and grabbed some binoculars, came back outside and focused on the object. through the binoculars, I could see the front of the object was red, the rest was either silver or white.  I pased my girlfriend the binoculars and she saw it. then she handed them to our friend who also saw it.  It seemed to be \"barrel-rolling\".   I got the binoculars back to look at it, and it disappeared.  I scanned the sky for a few seconds before I saw it again, but it was all black.   I ran through the house to the front yard, but lost sight of it again.  When I went back to the back patio, we were asking each other \"What was that?\"  Then I pointed out 2 F-15's flying in the direction the object went.  They were followed by an F-16 and 2 more F-15's.",

On holiday in Las vegas, on the night of 4/7/09, myself and two others were on the rooftop of our hotel having a drink, i had only been sitting facing toward the south side of the \"strip\" watching aircraft for five minutes when i seen it. I couldn't believe my eyes when these green lights travelling atleast twice or three times the speed of any aircraft in the area came into vision. They must have passed directly over the airport and were changing formations in ways no kind of fighter jets or anything could. Green lights, roughly 8 of them, circular, tightly packed and switching places but keeping in a tight formation, this was so distinct and clear, i wouldn't be surprised if aircraft or other people spotted this that night as the sky was clear and alot of planes and helicopters were around. Also as they were so low, probably on 2000ft, someone else must have seen what we did. I quickly said to the two people beside me to look and they too seen the lights, they moved so fast across the sky that they were gone over the hills to the west of vegas within 30 seconds, no noise came from this, which for the speed they were moving you would expect to hear something from it. Also seen a helicopter head of in that direction five mintues later, which seemed odd as no helicopters the whole week i was there seemed to head off in that direction. Watching the sky for strange things is not something i would often do, this was so real and i would have loved to have captured this on camera, it was truly unbelievable and i don't expect anyone to believe me but i know what i seen and it was to my eyes not of this world so to speak.",

We drove up to the screen that was showing our movie which pointed the car in the north direction in the large parking area.  I was sitting in the driver's seat and my friend was in the passenger's seat to the right of me.  There were a few cars around us and another screen directly to the right. It was facing east and playing another movie.  There was also another screen facing east that was next to the second screen farther south of the parking area. About an hour into the film, my friend gasped and asked \"what is that?\"  I glanced above the screen that was showing our film and we both noticed a V shaped object with circular lights on its underside. It was descending at a 90 degree angle just above and to the right of the screen.  It was smaller than the moon in comparison.  Its overall color was not determinable.  It seemed to descend in a fashion that mimicked a bird's. Before it passed behind the screen that was directly to the right of our car, the V shape of the object changed into a W shape.  I still can't explain how it managed to do this.  There was no sound of an engine or anything that would propel the craft.  After it passed behind the screen to the right and right before it disappeared behind the second screen to the right, it began to fade away into nothingness.  It looked as if it activated some sort of cloaking mechanism that appeared otherworldly and frankly, unnerving.  I don't know if it landed because it disappeared in a manner compared to smoke dispersing.  After the fading object passed behind the second screen, it was gone. I don't know if anyone else noticed this but I would assume that others had to, giving that the craft was quite noticeable and projected a feeling of fear and a foreboding presence.

I know alot of helicopter flights go out to the Grand Canyon from Vegas but the lights were all the same and moved in a very odd way, bright pulsing white with strobes of red pulsing up and down it seemed (which the stills show). No solid structure can be seen at all, either behind or in front of the lights.

      "story": "Sighting of 3 UFO's in the Las Vegas region in triangle formation that moved to a straight line. I just wanted to share an experience that I just shared this afternoon with several of my colleagues. So I'm currently residing in Las Vegas, and today is just another cloudless day in the valley. At about 2:30pm PST, we went outside, my two colleagues for a smoke break and some fresh air for myself. We sat down and I gazed up into the sky as it's been quite a long day. While looking up, I noticed three VERY high objects in the sky. Too high to be planes or helicopters. At first my colleagues thought they were planes but then I pointed out the fact that for starters, they were in a triangular formation and NOT moving. Then a plane actually passed by at a high altitude, close enough to the crafts for comparison (and it was very clearly a plane passing by)...it became very clearly the same kind of craft as these objects. I wish I could've documented the experience but the objects were too far to bee captured by a grainy cell phone camera and difficult enough to see with the naked eye (a little more clear with sunglasses). So now my colleagues and I are all observing these objects in a triangle and they appeared to be glowing white. When I put on my brown, polarized sunglasses, it became clear that two of them were glowing a pinkish purple color. I passed my sunglasses along and they all observed the same thing. Then, at the same time, we all noted their movement. It was too far to tell whether the two on the outsides or the one on the inside was moving from the triangle...or maybe all three were moving...but they shifted from a triangle to a straight line where they then continued to hover at a distance. We stared for a few more minutes and then decided to go in. When we told our coworkers, they wanted to see them too, so (two minutes later) we took our coworkers out to observe and the objects were gone. I have no professional experience in UFOlogy, but as an undergrad, took a class on UFOs in which I was trained to be the skeptic. My first thought was airplane and then I realized that they weren't moving but rather, static in a triangle formation. Then I thought weather balloons, but their movement was too controlled, too stable. There wasn't a cloud in the sky or an ounce of humidity in the air, and nothing grounded to create St. Elmo's fire. An airplane had passed within the same pane of vision for comparison so it wasn't a plane. Normally I would consider a project from Nellis, but here's the thing--when the moved from a triangle to a line, the movement was very slow. It took us all a moment to realize that they were actually moving. In the span of time from when I went inside and when I went back out and they were gone, with how slowly they appeared to be moving, there's no way they would've been out of our line of sight that quickly. Usually speed is exaggerated by dis! tance (the farther the object, the slower they appear to be moving) so I'm totally stumped. Thoughts?",

Two of the lights appeared to be closer than the rest as they appeared to separate slightly from the rest as they got closer, as if they were a bit forward of the others.  All lights appeared to be connected to one object since they did not move with respect to one another except for the above. As it got a bit closer I realized that it was NOT an airplane.  I nudged my friend I was sitting with and said: LOOK AT THAT!  She watched it pass directly overhead with me. It was totally silent. I estimate the velocity to be 300 to 500 knots, similar to an aircraft and an altitude of 2500 to 5000 feet.  The object covered about 3 to 7 degrees of arc from my view at its closest.

A week later it was back around the same time and i woke up my girlfriend to see this object,it was silent i flashed my light it blinked out.another 2 weeks later at the same spot same time The top cave was lighted up bright white  and the UFO was 50  ft away from the cave tilted at an angle  hovering like its looking into the cave.No lights were shining at that direction  into the cave and yet the cave was lighted up meaning so! me kind of activity is taking place.  The UFO was bigger.and brighter all  5 individual white lights in the UFO  was bright and hovered at that spot,Meanwhile i got excited and i shined my laser light at that direction and went down to my kitchen and opened my kitchen door facing the garage , just then i heard a clicking noise in my right ear (like a dolphin makes),..I did not open my garage door and ignored the noise which went away and returned to my bedroom and it was gone,both lights blinked out including the cave light.I left the country for few months and hope to follow up on my return.We need to respect their presence .People get facinated with UFOs and yet despise the Aliens like some kind of Freaks.Ufos are nothing without the aliens so dont freak out if you are not prepared to accept them.

My balcony faces Northeast towards Nellis Airforce Base in Las Vegas, NV, and has a clear view of the northeastern section of sky.  As I smoke, I frequently watch planes landing or taking off from Mcarren Airport, or I watch aircraft fly to and from Nellis.  On August 27th around 3 p.m. I was on my balcony, and I noticed right away that a plane was approaching Las Vegas from the North. Whats interesting about that is Ive learned through months of everyday observing that planes do not fly in from the North, so I picked up my binoculars (used for watching the planes and helicopters fly from Nellis) and saw that it was one of those \"Janet\" planes that transport employees to and from Area 51 (Classic red stripe passenger plane with no identifiable markings). As I followed the plane with my binoculars, I then noticed something appear in my field of vision that was further away beyond the! Janet plane. I stopped and adjusted my binocs to get a clearer image of what this object was, and once I did I could see a white, solid, dome shaped object hovering in place far off in the distance. I know distances can be deceiving, so I dont want to say how far away i think it was exactly, but I can say it was miles, beyond Sunrise mountain and perhaps even Lake Mead. I stood and watched it for 2-3 minutes until I noticed another Janet plan coming into approach at McCarran. I took my eyes off the craft for only a second and when I scanned the area it had been, it was gone! I searched the entire sky for about 20 minutes and never saw it again. It was dome shaped, white and never moved from the spot I first saw it. I assume that it was far away, and if it was then I would say the craft was huge. Being stationary, I was able to study it for 2-3 minutes through my binoculars and though it was too far to make out any details, I can say it was big enough to clearly make out it! s shape. I am absolutely certain that it was not a plane, heli! copter, weather balloon, or any other craft Ive ever seen in my life. It was a clear, hot summer day with no clouds in sight. I hope you find this information useful. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD))",

After viewing it for a few minutes, the object appeared to move in an unorthodox fashion(up/down, side to side), and every few minutes a light would be emitted from the center of the object as if it were shining some type of spotlight.  The military would not confirm or deny any aircraft in the air, nor would they release any information, and there were no aircraft in that area according to information obtained from local airports.

A huge dark thing was floating sideways and up into the air.  I told the person on the phone, \u201coh that\u2019s odd, kinda\u2019 looks like a metallic balloon has been let go into the sky by someone.  And it did look like that, a grey/black sorta\u2019 metallic looking with an occasional extremely bright light omitting periodically. Rationalizing that it is a balloon I let my attention stray. A few minutes pass and I look to the sky to see the progress of flight. To my surprise, the \u201cballoon\u201d is not where I thought it would be. In fact, it appears to be stationary and not as high as expected. Now it has my full attention. I watch as the dark mass with the bright light glided horizontally towards the North West of the valley. Watching in disbelief and curiosity, after a few minutes, I witness it angle and then turn back towards the SW, towards me. I am now talking to my mom on the phone (trying to direct her view to see what I am seeing), the unidentified flying object is now heading directly towards me. I am sure it was just my perception, but the object was flying then stopped, what seem to be directly over me and then began to hover. A full minute passed and I noticed the bright light was still as intense but the dark matter was dissipating. I realized the craft was now starting to ascend. Several moments passed as it continued to hover and rise. Then it slowly drifted towards the North East. My experience was over. I always believed, just too much credible information not to, I just never thought I would get the opportunity to experience such an anomaly with my own two eyes. I am not looking for validation, I am just sharing my experience. Thank you for your forum to share these stories, you allow us to truly be \u201cnot alone\u201d.",

We proceeded to my truck in the east side parking lot, when one of my family members had gone to the restroom.  I then hopped on the bed cover of my truck to wait for her.  I laid back with my hands behind my head looking straight up with my legs pointing north and the mountain to my left.  When I stared at the clouds I seen what looked like bugs flying around but realized that the objects were not bugs, but were dark and circular. I could not determine the size, if anyone can hold a pencil strait out it would be the size of the tip of the lead but in a circular shape.  It was roughly 4-5 objects flying like as if they were playing and with great speed, they would even stop in mid air and were flying in and out of the clouds. I stared at them for about four to five minutes while trying to tell my wife what I was looking at but unfortunately  my wi! fe has really bad eye sight and could not see what I was seen. Finally my eye sight was getting bleary from focusing too hard and look way to recuperate my eyes, after one or two minutes I looked again and only seen one and it wasn\u2019t event five seconds when it bolted with tremendous speed north toward the red rock scenic view and disappeared after a few hundred feet. Never had I seen with my own eyes anything in any nature that fast in my entire life and will always remember this day.",

We also looked at orion  Phil asked me to look up at what he thought was a flock of birds.  To me It was a diamond shaped shiloutted object. With several lights that had a faint glow. It was very high up and quiet. We watched it for a moment as it drifted north to south across the constellation of orion. I ran to get my glasses from truck and lost track of it upon return.  Very weird, came from out north which is about 120 miles south of area 51 from me  It wasn't a regular plane due to appearance of shape, speed was about same, and I heard no noise  Phil anything to add or correct, make sure you use reply all so the thread continues  We immediately told michael and olivia when we came back up to apartment  This is as honest of an account as I can give",

The best I can describe the shape is like a thin slice of black, I may have been to far away to get the full definition of the craft. But it hung in the same spot for at least 5-8 minutes, had me staring the entire time till it started moving slowly towards Las Vegas strip and disappeared behind the mountain range. It was rather strange, I've never seen anything like that. I have been to many airshows and I don,'t really know to many aircraft that can stay in the same place unless it was a helicopter from really far away, but after review, I ruled that out judging from Its shape.

      "date": "2011-12-12T00:00:00",
      "story": "Close encounter at home   This report is intended to detail an extremely unusual occurrence that I have kept to myself for more than 23 years, partly because of its incredibly odd and unique nature, and partly because I haven't known what to do with the information. After hearing Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM this evening (Tu., 10/25/2011) urging witnesses to document their experiences, I decided to pull into the nearest late-night restaurant with a WiFi hookup and finally write this down. This is not a report of a sighting (I will submit another report for one of several I've had over a 40-year period), but rather of what I firmly believe to have been an alien presence in my home. It was breaking dawn on a Sunday morning at the end of August, 1988, about 6:00 a.m. when I found myself waking from a very sound sleep to hear my wife, who was sleeping next to me, speaking in a very high-speed whisper.  And then I heard the response from another individual, also whispering faster than anything I'd ever heard like it in my life. I suspect it was the sound of these two that woke me, but the experience of HOW I woke up was unique as well.  First, I was more clear-headed than usual compared to how I typically awaken.  Second, it was as if by instinct that I came awake without either opening my eyes or moving any other part of my body--as if subconsciously I had been preparing for just such an opportunity to observe as the one I found myself in at that point.  But I have no recollection of actually planning any such thing, only that when the moment presented itself, I \"played dead\" and listened. The speed of the back-and-forth whispering was such that I could not make out a single word being said.  It was as if two individuals were trying to mimic the sounds made by an old fashioned radio dial being turned back and forth as it nears a station signal; kind of a \"swishing\" and \"swirling\" of sounds, only being peppered in whispers at machine-gun velocity. I listened intently as this went on for about one and a half to two minutes.  I noticed that there was no emotion, no sense of urgency, as might be expected when someone speaks much faster than usual.  Instead it was more like \"machine efficiency\"--a personal characteristic that I would never ascribe to my wife.  It struck me that information (it impressed me as being more like \"raw data\") was being exchanged very quickly, like between two computers, as opposed to a conversation taking place. Then it suddenly stopped.  I have no way to back this up, but it felt like I had been \"caught\" eavesdropping (when I was \"supposed to be\" asleep), which brought this bizarre exchange to an abrupt halt. I don't know why, but instinct seemed to kick in immediately, telling me to pretend like I had just started to wake up.  So I did. The second I began moving, my eyes still closed, I heard the sound of little feet running from my wife's side of the bed, out the door of our bedroom, then fading down the hall.  It was unnaturally fast, lasting less than two seconds from start to finish. At that point I gently shook my wife's shoulder.  It took a moment for her to emerge from a very deep sleep. She remembered nothing of the encounter. I did not dream this.  I was wide awake and alert, and did not go back to sleep once it ended. The situation never repeated.  And I'd never heard of anyone having a similar experience until one night recently on C2C-AM, when George Noory took an open-line call from a man whose experience closely aligned with mine.  But the caller had barely gotten out the gist of his story when Noory had to cut to a commercial, and he made no comment on it afterward.",

Just before sunset on this particular evening I was sitting on the balcony of the Knights Inn airport hotel in Las Vegas located at 5100 Paradise Rd.

They appeared pretty far away.  I would guess from where I was they must have been between 5 to 10 miles away.    I studied them carefully and determined that they were not any type of man made aircraft I am aware of.  I work for the airlines and I am familiar with aircraft of many kinds in various types of weather and lighting conditions and have never seen anything like this before.  They literally looked like balls of fire floating in the sky.   During this sighting the fireballs would fly in formation left and right at low speed, then separate and fly apart from one another then all come together and form one ball of fire.  They did this many times until eventually the single fireball ascended into the sky and became invisible to the naked eye. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights?

When in Vegas, our routine is to get to the pool at or around the time they open, which is typically 9:00 am.  That day we arrived at the pool, picked our spots, and were in the pool by 9:30.  At this time, half of Las Vegas is still asleep, so there were no more than 20 people at this pool at this time. Weather conditions: Hot (probably high 80\u2019s already, I believe it got up to 103 later that day); not a single cloud in the sky. No wind. Shortly after dipping in the pool, I noticed a large, unusually shaped white luminous come from over the mountain range to the West/Northwest of the Las Vegas strip (I believe the Spring Mountain Range?).  There is not one thing I can think of to describe the shape, except that it was a cluster of some sorts, with a rod coming down from it.  My initial skeptical reaction was that it was balloons, but: at that distance, and it\u2019s size, it could not be balloons, and at that point is was easy enough to see detail that it definitely was not balloons.  Plus it emitted a bright, glowing light. I was pointing it out to my wife, and other people around us began to notice and talk about it as well.   The object got higher in the sky, then started moving south along the mountain range (towards the flight path of McCarren Airport).   Then, another object came over the range.  This object, was smaller, and appeared to be a single oval shape.  It was the same white color, and also emitted the sam! e bright white light. Over the next hour or so, we watched the objects as they moved to the south/southwest.  They were definitely moving in tandem, and sometimes swap positions (left/right), but they always were fairly far apart.   It was around 11:00 am when I saw the two lights for the last time.  They were quite faint, far & at a high altitude.  One was straight to the south, and one was southwest; they were very far apart at this point. Here are some other notes:   -Right after the second object came into view, the area they were would have been directly in the flight path for departures/arrivals at McCarren Airport. I noticed that during that time period, no planes took off or landed from that direction. If possible, can you attain air traffic control recording, chatter from that day? Whatever the objects were, they had to have been talking about it, because the control tower would have had clear view of the objects the whole time. -Also, there were approximately 10 helicopters the roared overhead (LV strip/Grand Canyon tours) during the time period where the sighting took place. Pilots & tourists had to have seen it. -Reason for waiting to report after a month: I thought for sure someone else, perhaps an aviation professional would have made a report by now. I\u2019ve been checking this site and others like it daily since this sighting happened hoping to see something but to no avail. I am still disturbed at how blatant these craft were above a major city, one of the busiest airports in the US, and the fact that they came from the general direction of Area 51 & the Nevada Test Site. -I\u2019d be happy to answer any questions an investigator may have. -I can draw a picture of the objects; and/or a diagram of the timeline of the movement of them upon request.",

STATEMENT OF UFO SIGHTING  I was driving home on August 19, 2011, and turning off of the highway at US 95 North at Fort Apache - Horse Drive at approximately 8:30 pm.  This location is situated in North-West Las Vegas, Nevada. As I was approaching Horse Drive, I noticed two very distinctive bright orange colored lights in the sky.  At first I thought they may be special street lights, because they are doing construction work in the area.  As I got closer, driving down Horse Drive, it suddenly became clear that they were not street lights. I continued driving down Horse Drive, glaring at these lights and when I was sure of what I saw, I stopped to observe.  There was a maroon colored van, which had apparently been observing the two lights as well. The two lights were like fire and shaped like a tear drop or a clove.  The sky was dark (just beyond dusk), stars were visible.  The objects were identical.  The color was pinkish-orange at the bottom, yellowish-orange in the middle, and yellow at the top.  They were very bright.  It was just like fire and they were hovering and behaving like the movement of fire.  They appeared to be much larger than the stars, yet about 1/3 size of a regular full moon.  They were a good distinctive distance between each other, but they were clearly identical in shape and size. As I was observing these two beings, one of them shot away over and behind the western mountains.  The maroon colored van made a U-turn and drove back up Horse Drive.  The speed of the shooting being was a little slower than lightening speed, but very, very fast.  The remaining one just hovered.  As I began to move down the street a little further, the being moved parallel to me.  I proceeded to turn in on my street and I could still see it.  I stopped the car again just before turning into my garage and the being just sat there.  I pulled into my garage and closed the door.  I grabbed my digital camera and went back outside to take pictures, but it was gone. I called the police to report it and they gave me your number. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and sincere.  We suspect that she was an excellent witness.  PD))",

It was flying very fast.   We tried to compare to another airplane flying, but the plane was much slower, and we knew it was not a satellite. About 5 minutes later, about 10 miles ahead of us at the base of the mountain we saw a white light flash onto the mountain. It did this for about 1 minute until it turned into a single tiny red light once.  After the red light went off a bright white light began moving towards us.  We drove off in fear but then returned about 10 minutes later and sat in the same spot, and the lights were gone.

I have 20/10 corrected vision and have seen many aircraft growing up in a Navy family and being stationed all over the world.   It was unlike anything I have seen.  After a few minutes, it moved in a straight line, a hands width or maybe 5 degrees, then stopped. It would be difficult to estimate speed as I have no idea how high up it was, or how large it was.  It took a second or two to move and come to a stop.  It stayed in that position for a couple minutes, then moved back to its' original position, where it remained for several more minutes.   We finally went inside and did not see it again.  We joked at the time it was a UFO.  After 20 or 30 minutes we realized we had seen something odd.

Me and a friend of mine stayed in a suite with a balcony facing towards the MGM / Luxor hotel. At night the Luxor shines a very bright beam of light into the sky, which originates at the tip of its pyramid structure and goes straight up. We were preparing to go out into the Vegas nightlife. I stood on the balcony and at about 9:35pm I noticed unusual glowing dots in the Luxor light beam at an estimated hight of max. 400-500 meters, maybe closer to ground. There was a shining 3-light and a 4-light formation. They were \u201edancing\u201c around each other in the light beam, always keeping some formation. When they moved out of the light beam a few times they were still visible, but barley. Those motions went back and forth into and out of the light beam. Always in a pattern and always in an unnatural movement \u2013 up, down, even standing in mid-air, which I with my knowledge only can call unidentifiable. It was a very clear night, no clouds, stars were bright, airplanes and helicopters clearly visible and distinguishable. Yes, there was air traffic from the nearby airport \u2013 but by its motion airplanes, helicopters, birds reflecting light, remote-controlled toys like octocopters etc. can be exempt. After 5 minutes of being baffled by it I called my friend outside to the balcony \u2013 he confirmed the sighting, but couldn\u2019t explain it to me logically either. After another 5 minutes of watching the spectacle I went inside to get my phone, wanting to film it.

      "story": "White Orbs interacting intelligently over Las Vegas BLVD It was my last night in Las Vegas.  My girlfriend and I were staying at the Flamingo about to watch George Wallace's 10 pm show.  We were right outside the Flamingo facing the strip as she pointed to the sky and asked me what the objects were to the North. I immediately pulled out my camera and what I captured were bright white lights or orbs that would sometimes flash different colors as they hovered in the sky.  These lights spawned from each other creating new lights.  The orbs had the ability to move up and down, left and right all while hovering in the exact same area.  The way in which these objects moved defy the laws of physics.  The orbs seemed to interact with one another intelligently as they formed various and completely random shapes in the sky.  The way these objects behaved was almost as if they were showing off and wanted to be seen.  Sometimes there would be 4 or 5, and other times there were easily 20 or more.  Some of the orbs would dart away from! the group at very high speeds.  Other orbs just seemed to join the group and appear out of no where. At times one or two orbs would hover alone above the group.  A minimum of 2 airplanes flew by these orbs as I captured them on video.  My girlfriend and I , as well as one other couple seemed to be the only people paying attention to this event.  After filming for about 10 minutes we proceeded to watch George Wallace's 10 pm show.  After the show which lasted about an hour and a half I went back outside to find the objects were gone.  They never returned. My background: I am a musician and graphic designer, 29 years of age.",

We watched it for about a minute and said if it was balloons they\u2019d probably be moving around in the wind.    The formation remained still but then we noticed 3 red objects come from within and they were definitely moving in formation away from the white objects.   The three red objects were joined by a fourth and they were moving to the south.

It moved toward zenith very slowly until becoming stationary at about 60 degrees above the western horizon.  The intensity became constant for about 30 seconds, after which it disappeared entirely.  Immediately afterwards, a Grand Canyon tour helicopter flew past the courthouse at about 200 foot altitude.   Seconds after the helicopter passed by, the object reappeared, exhibiting its highest observed brightness, being roughly equivalent to Venus in intensity (when observed at dusk) and just large enough to clearly make out its sharply defined spherical shape with the naked eye.

I noticed three lights above the mountains north of Las Vegas. At first I thought they were fighter jets in formation doing maneuvers but suddenly all the lights disappeared but came back on a few seconds later.  These lights didn\u2019t seem to be moving upon further observation but just lighting up and dimming back down.  With my eyes peeled in this direction of the sky there was sudden streak from west to east lasting only a few seconds and \u201cexceedingly\u201d faster than any plane or shooting star I\u2019ve ever witnessed.  I was on the phone with a friend and describing what I was seeing to him.  I see airplanes in the sky all the time in Vegas but these lights and streak didn\u2019t seem to match anything I see on a normal basis.   After the streak I didn\u2019t anymore lights but still curious I drove west a bit into the desert to get a better vantage point.  That's when I looked up National UFO Reporting Center and called.   As I was calling there was too more stationary brilliant red lights (about 3 times the size of a normal star) that lit up in the same area, one immediately after the other.  Both stayed lit for approximately two to three seconds and then disappeared.  I hung around for another fifteen minutes but saw nothing else. I am a college instructor, and teacher.  This is the first time I\u2019ve ever reported a sighting. I feel what I saw was significantly unique enough to follow through with filing a report.",

My friend and I were visiting outside and she had noticed the object.  I looked over and saw the craft, noticed that it was making zero noise, and took a few snap shots and a short video on my phone before the object got out of my focal on my camera.  The object traveled at a somewhat slow but constant speed, was very bright, but had a constant slow flicker. It continues outward into the sky and after it was out of the focal reach of the camera, I continues to watch the object until it was too far up to be seen.  Not sure what it was, but a stone shouldn't be able to reach those heights, and would make noise. It was round with no distinguishable \"body\" of a craft, so in this case it was purely an orange globe of light. This is not the first time I've seen I things in the area, but was the first that was not only close, but very close.  Last time I'd noticed something was a group of what looked to be stars moving very rapidly, and in a pack of at least thirty tiny white dots, all in a tight pack but dot of moved around quickly and again, moved off into very high reaches until out of sight.  I don't report this one because I'm not even sure what it was, but this recent one was a bit too distinguishable, as well as it coming out from near ground level and out of the middle of a mountain...

The play began at 8:00 p.m. under a somewhat cloudy sky threatening rain later on. At about 8:15p.m.-8:30p.m., an object between two trees to my right appeared in the sky above tree level. The object was about the size of my hand with my arm extended toward it, an equilateral triangle in shape, dome-shaped white lights formed a row around the inside dark perimeter of the triangle with a red dome light in the center. Against the grey cloudy sky the object was solid and a darker black-grey reminding me of the skin of the Stealth Plane. The object moved from the N/NW going in a S/SE direction. I lost sight of it behind two trees, but it re-appeared again about 60 seconds later. It seemed to be traveling rather slowly and flat so the visible area was the triangle with the lights below which stayed on continuously. There was no sound. It moved beyond my vision and though I watched the sky the remainder of the play until @ 9:15 p.m., I didn\u2019t observe any other unusual occurrence. I was amazed at the lack of response by the people around me who clearly saw the object then just continued to watch the play.

There were no landing lights or strobes on this flying object.  I call it an object because I am familiar with commercial aircraft and some of the common military aircraft which flies over and this was huge.  I waited about 30 seconds as it approached not quite overhead but a little off centered and that is when I saw a red element at it\u2019s leading edge not on what would be the left side of the aircraft.  I wanted to see if it passed a star to be better able to see some shape on this but it did not pass any visible stars because of the time so I do not know what shape this was.   I ran to my front of my house to see if it continued towards the SE but lost sight of it.   It was running dark. I subsequently called the local channels KLASTV and Channel 13 describing the above and got the response this was the first reporting.   I got the impression they thought I was a prank call but I do not randomly call anyone just for the sake of taking someone else\u2019s time unneccesarily. Because of how dark it was I do not think my cellphone could have captured anything because of the resolution and lighting.   All I can say is I saw a flying object and it was HUGE.  I live in the flight path of departing aircraft in LAS (Las Vegas) and watch commercial aircraft quite a bit and see at times the International space station pass over.   It is fun to see such a marvel. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Update to Earlier Report this evening This is a follow up to the contents below:  After I was contacted by an investigator last night and it was explained to me that what I saw was possibly a Blimp.  This is plausible although I do not live in North Las Vegas where the N Las Vegas Airport is and is known to have blimps there. I was asked to contact the FSS at Las Vegas and since I do not have a phone book at my home, I went on line and was given some phone numbers but it was not the FSS so after half an hour, I looked at the facts below and wrote this off as a blimp which makes sense.  I am satisfied with that because a that could explain why it was running dark and the light configuration was not your typical fixed winged aircraft and the low humming sound I heard. Believe me when I say I do not normally do this and was not looking to cause any problems. Thank you for responding so quickly. What I originally wrote: I was in my backyard at 1823 when I heard a low hum (not a commercial aircraft engine type or helicopter) and looked towards the NW and saw a green light (like an aircraft on its right wing) approaching and I looked for the red element which would indicate the edge wing.

Nine round lights in an almost vertical direction ( 90 degree angle into the sky above) hovered but were mostly stationary over the N/NW part of the city of N Las Vegas.  The lights were equally spaced apart and would get bright and then dim in patterns.  For example, all lights would turn bright together and then dim, whereupon the bottom most light (maybe starting 250 feet above the buildings and homes) would turn a red color, the 2nd through 8th lights would go bright up the almost vertical line of light one by one, successively, after the other until the ninth and topmost light would grow bright red.  I and five other witness watched this for about 45 minutes straight. The patterns of the lights glowing bright white and then fading out almost completely, was constantly changing, almost pulsing at times, and the lights were moving very slowly, not breaking formation  due West.   As we were all viewing this event, a light appeared in the sky in front of us, South of the formation and closer to us.  It shot upwards after appearing and faded out completely. Additionally, closer and to the NW, we observed another bright light appear, and  travel at high speed for a second and disappear.  Appeared high up in space.  To right of the Big Dipper.  We all also observed another shooting light orb appearing out of nowhere and shooting upwards, arcing and disappearing. this was again South of the formation to the North and lower and much closer to our viewing position. Finally the formation moved West at a faster speed, all lights disappearing but one, which proceeded to grow brighter and much bigger.  At peak light intensity it vanished. We could no longer see anything in the sky to the North.  About a minute or less after the final large round light went out, as we were talking about it, we looked to the North East as a huge bright light caught our eye.  It was traveling in a South Easterly direction and appeared to be a large white light traveling very fast.  It was pretty close and low, and large.  Very bright white. It too vanished by going from extremely bright to dim in milliseconds.  Then it was gone. Looked like the large light from the formation, at the end.  Don't know if it was or not. Again six of us observed the light formation for around 45 minutes. We were driving and saw the formation, and stopped near our home to observe it.  So crazy we could not stop watching all of the events.  We have no idea if anyone else around the city saw it, but I am positive others observed it.  It was glaringly not helicopters or planes or flares. It was occurring pretty well in the center of Vegas and North of Vegas proper and before the mountain range.  Lights extended into the sky well above the mountains. We watched the",

It was a clear evening, and I noticed a pulsating donut shaped red and green object to the north.  The only reference points were the large buildings on the other side of the strip, as I estimate this object could have been 2-3 miles away and above 2000+ feet up in the night sky.  The \"Christmas Donut\" as I called it was proceeding in a slow pace to the west. I had my small digital camera which also takes video with me.  I proceeded taking 8 photos and 2 videos of this object, my girlfriend also saw this object, as did numerous patrons and associates of the club.  What was kind of strange is that other people that I excitedly exclaimed about the object, could care less, also they closed the patio and made everyone go inside the building.  They could have closed the patio at 11pm, I don't know.  I watched the object intensely as I photographed and videoed the object, what was unique is how the object changed shape as it progressed across the sky and there was some type of strobe light on the second video I recorded.  My photos are somewhat blurred due to no tripod, but as I stated this object was a donut, where you could see through the middle, and was quite large due to the distance.

The time is 2:00PM and it is a sunny, clear sky afternoon.  It also happens to be primary election day.  I returned from voting and as the temperature was mild I went out to the patio and sat in a recliner to enjoy a bit of sunshine.  The houses are two stories with chimneys extending approximately  ten feet above the roofline.  Between my house and the one next door is full bushy tree of about the same height as the roof. I was gazing up at the sky and speculating on election results when an object emerged from the behind the tree moving slowly but steadily from west to east.  It maintained consistent altitude, speed and was silent.  The appearance was that of a large tall aluminum can turned on its side.  The surface was dull silver with an area along lower rear in black.  No wings, other protrusions, markings or obvious means of propulsion was evident.  It certainly didn\u2019t seem to be aerodynamically designed for flight. I was somewhat drowsy when it first appeared and I immediately assumed that it was a banner or hot air balloon relating to the elections, which is not an unusual site in Vegas.  I immediately dismissed this assessment, as the altitude was so low that a plane hauling it or the apparatus needed for it to be a hot air balloon would be visible and was conspicuously absent.  I then considered that it might be space debris, perhaps part of a satellite that was falling to earth, but it seemed to be moving too slowly and steadily at a maintained altitude for this to be the case.  The altitude was so low that the object was occluded from vision when it passed behind the chimney. What I am about to report now is going to make me sound crazy or hallucinatory.  I can only say that I have never been subject to hallucinations; and neither was I drinking alcohol or using any form of drugs, prescription or otherwise.   When the object began to pass behind the chimney, I got up and proceeded along the left side of the house to get a better view before it would pass behind another tree to my left.  To my astonishment the object seemed to have simply vanished. That evening I thoroughly checked all local news sources, but found no reference. ((NUFORC Note:",

The location was along the road going to Mount Charleston, in the vicinity of Las Vegas, Nevada. Two witnesses were parked along the road.  They were observing a recent meteor shower.  They were looking north, away from the city lights of Las Vegas.  Only a few meteors were spotted.  They came from the northeast direction.  Each meteor sighting lasted for about a second. However, a bright white light approached from the southeast.  It was in the shape of an orb.  Another object red orb shaped object appeared nearby.  Both objects moved towards the west over the Las Vegas skyline.  Both objects emitted an aura, or a haze, which was changing shape.  At various times, each object stopped and hovered still.  These events occurred until 2:30 AM. At 2:30 AM, the red orb shaped object disappeared.  It immediately reappeared about 25 miles to the southeast, about one second later.  It remained stationary for another half hour.  During this time period, the larger White shaped orb moved to the east.  It changed into a diamond shape.  Immediately thereafter, it changed into a triangular shape, with three bright lights in each corner.  This occurred for about 10 minutes, until it disappeared. Both witnesses returned to Las Vegas by 3:30 AM.  They were standing in a cul-de-sac observing the night sky.  At this time, the large white orb reappeared, coming from the northeast.  Two red orbs appeared nearby.  The large white orb changed into a boomerang shape.  It came closer to the neighborhood where the two witnesses were standing on the cul-de-sac.  The boomerang shaped object had bright white lights along each section or wing.  It approached even closer, and it remained stationary, hovering about 500 feet above the ground.  The two red orbs moved closer to this boomerang shaped object, hovering at about 600 feet above the ground.  By this time, the boomerang object emitted a beam of white light which was scanning from the left to right, and back again. However, the two red orbs each focused a red beam of light down into the cul-de-sac.  Following this, the red beams of light completely engulfed a house on the cul-de-sac.  The red beams of light created a red, green, yellow, and white spherical haze around the house.  The spherical haze had holographic properties, however it was difficult to ascertain definite shapes within the holographic properties.  This holographic type ball of light continued to change colors.  Then it stopped. Both witnesses continued to observe the three unidentified flying objects.  At 3:45 AM, witness number one decided to \u201c signal\u201c these three objects in the following manner:  Witness number one held his left  arm up and made three blinking motions with his left hand.  Then he paused for a second, held up his right arm, and made a single up and down motion, followed by a short pause, and continuing with four horizontal motions.  Continuing, the first witness walked in a circle.  The first witness did this to symbolize the number pi, as a universal mathematical constant, and to show its relationship to circles.  The first witness repeated this series of motions two more times, for a total of three times. Immediately thereafter each object transformed into disks.  The first object had three green lights on the underside.  These lights made a circular pattern, and rotated counter clockwise three times.  This was followed by a flash of bright white light. Continuing, four bright red lights appeared in a circular fashion.  They rotated clockwise, making four circular motions.  This entire pattern was repeated by the second object.  After this pattern was completed by the second object, the same exact and entire pattern was repeated by the third object.  This was also done again, in the same manner, two more times, for a total of three times.  By 3:00 AM, the first object changed into a boomerang, hovering for several minutes until it vanished.  The next two objects changed back into red orbs, and shortly thereafter, they also disappeared.",

We noticed lights off into the distance from our upstairs bedroom window that we had never seen before.  So, we pulled out the telescope and were able to see the lights circling above ground.  We wondered if it could be helicopters circling over a fire when we noticed some of the lights turn bright red.  But the colors kept changing from white or yellowish to red, so it couldn't have been flames.   Plus we turned on the news and heard no reports of a ire out near red rock, where the lights seem to be near.  At one point 4 red lights appeared to break off from a brighter yellowish white light and scattered in different directions.  What the heck is this?  And why isn't it on the news?  If it were helicopters, surely they would be news helicopters, right?",

      "story": "Orange Fireballs fly over Las Vegas I came across your website (amongst others), while trying to research what I call &quot;stringed fireballs&quot;.  It appears as if I am not the only one who has seen them, however I see no reports of this in Las Vegas yet.  I was on my way home last night and I made a right turn onto a surface street (facing north) and saw the orange lights flying in the sky.  Others were slamming on their brakes and I assumed a speed trap, but they had seen them as well.  I didn't get a count of them but I personally saw 10-15 of them.  They were about a football field apart, were orange and flickering like a flame.  It didn't appear to look like any type of aircraft light to me, and there were no standard red/blue lights on the wings like normal aircraft have. They flew slowly, but seemed to change direction rather quickly.  They were moving as if they were connected by an invisible string.  Half of them rotated, as if they were pivoting on the center light, and the other half pivoted the other way, pivoting on the center light.  The lights quickly changed from a straight line to almost a letter V, but not perfect like you would expect from military. I assumed perhaps it was after-burner light coming from a military plane, so I rolled down the window in my car and sat there.  I heard absolutely nothing.  Everything was completely silent, other than road traffic. It was the strangest thing I have seen in a long time.  Las Vegas is the home to Nellis Air Force Base, so I thought maybe it was something coming from there.  But I am thinking that this is unlikely as the circumstances were too odd.",

All in a straight line front to back, except for three of them (the middle ones) which were in a row / side by side.   The three side by side moved / swirled strangely and around each other.  They were moving all in succession heading from S/SE to the N/NW direction.   At first glance I thought maybe they were helicopters, but they were a deep orange/red color with no sound (not helicopters)!   After watching for about 1 minute or so, the ones in the middle began to fade out, then the ones toward the front, then the ones in the rear.   The \"leader\" of the lights stayed for another minute, then I stopped watching and went into the store.   There was nobody else in the store parking lot at that time, but surely hundreds of others saw these objects, whatever they were.",

The first object was moving away and north we determined this by it becoming more and more faint and decending and moving right (north north east) at a slow pace. Seconds after the second object moved out of view a third object just appeared in the same place the second object was sighted it too was pulsating all colors of visible light went from a hover to moving in exactly the same way as the second object same alt., Speed, and direction a civilian Jet flew under the third object in no more than a minute it disappeared in the same place as the second.  At 9:28 P.M. MST the first object fell below the buildings and trees of the city what seemed over Creech AFB. all 3 objects all displayed the same color and flash pattern.

As he sat down, he exposed the sky above him and I saw the UFO. The UFO was at a 25 degree elevation to me, about 1 - 3 miles away, as I looked SSE.  The UFO was headed due south.  It appeared to be right over the Las Vegas (McCarran) airport.  It was about the size of a dime held at arm's length.  It was white, and shaped like a full-bodied arrow on a street sign.  The stem of the arrow was only as long as the arrow head was wide.  It produced a brief white tail behind itself, the full height of the arrow. The UFO was going dangerously fast if it was over the airport.  It moved at 3 to 6 times the speed of the airliners I constantly see in that area. I watched it for 20 seconds.  I stammered for my son to look, so he observed the flight for 10 seconds.  As it flew south, my view was soon going to be blocked by my second story roof line.  Just as I was about to lose my line of sight, the UFO just vanished out of sight in an instant.  I heard no unusual noises that evening.",

      "story": "Black triangle seen in 1994 over Las Vegas. 911 called. I am reporting this today because of all the attention UFO's have been getting lately.  I had always thought that my story would be irrelevant because it was only a sighting, but after watching a UFO show on the Travel Channel, I'd report my experience just to have it on record. It was around June of 1994 and i was living in Las Vegas in an apartment complex on Desert Inn and Pecos.  I was living with my girlfriend named Dana Scavone at the time and was a dice dealer. I got off from work at 8pm and went to the apartment.  It's been a long time so the exact time of the occurance escapes me, but i want to say around 9:30 pm or somewhere in that time frame.  I smoked outside, and we lived on the second floor of our apartment complex, and stepped outside of the apartment door onto the balcony, lit a cigarette, and as i was smoking the cigarette i happened to look up...and that's when i saw a HUGE, black, perfectly triangled craft slowly moving across the sky making no noise whatsoever.  The craft couldn't have been more than 1000 ft. up, moving from the northwest towards the southeast.  This craft was black, had no bright lights, but did have some kind of circular metallic object in the bottom side middle of the craft. I looked in awe for a few moments and then yelled for my girlfriend Dana to come out and look at what i was seeing. Dana came outside and looked up and said, \"Oh my God, what is that?\".  I replied, \"I think it's a UFO\". I then ran into the apartment, grabbed the telephone and dialed 911.  The operator answered and i proceeded to tell her exactly what i was looking at.  I said to the 911 operator, \"I am looking at a huge black triangle in the sky right now as we speak, and it's flying right over my apartment\"; or something to that effect.  The 911 operator was not mad at me as i had thought they might be for calling in a UFO (Which i didn't even think really existed), but was more interested in the idea that i was really looking at a UFO.  I think i asked her if she had heard aything from other callers, and she replied that she had not.  Then one of us decided that i should contact McCarran airport or Nellis AFB to see if they might have anything on ra! dar to explain the craft.  I remember just saying something like, \"Maybe you guys should contact Nellis and see if they have something because i am definitely seeing a huge black triangle fly right over my apartment\". I hung up the phone and watched the craft continue on towards the Southeast as it climbed and eventually disappeared out of sight. I heard no noise.  I am absolutely sure of what i saw.  And if you can get the 911 audio, you'll clearly see how startled i was. This event happened.  This was not an airplane.  This was a triangle.  It moved slowly, without sound, directly over my head.",

I was driving in my jeep around 7:45 P.M (occasion 1) and in my review (sic.  Rearview)) mirror me and my girl friend saw for about 30 seconds the exact same thing as video 1. Video 1 and two are not my videos but exactly what i have seen on two occasions.  Video two happened about 7 year ago in the same spot in las vegas.  I was driving home around dusk and i fixed on an object and it stood still for about 7 seconds started moving and then disappeared.  I will attach the two videos.  The videos are \"exactly what i saw\". I had a physicist look at the videos and he believes them to be hoaxes.  That is a easy perspective to have from a computer.  I believe these videos deserve a second look. I will attach his E-Mail as well.  Just wanted to share.  Thanks for the great site!    Video 1 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyKjUAxywrE   Video 2 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO49ho_gHAc   physicist response:   Hi, ((name deleted)),   I looked over the videos.  On the short one from China I can\u2019t help much \u2013 I don\u2019t see anything in the images that gives me a clue as to what is happening.  It does appear that the shape of the object is constant throughout the video \u2013 at least to within the resolution of the video.  However, I would really like to know why the videographer called it UFO with digital FX \u2013 makes me wonder what the effects are. On the other (lights in the Vegas night sky), I do have a few comments.  First, the entire clip is being taken with a video-capable camera on a pretty solid tripod, so it isn\u2019t a case of someone pulling out their cell phone to video what they are seeing. Another thing that seems pretty clear is that there are a bunch of objects at a higher angle above ground, and a second, smaller bunch of objects closer to the horizon.  A third thing to note is that the top of the hotel at the right of the image is out of focus.  There is so little difference between focusing at infinity and focusing at, say, 300 feet that if the camera is recording sharp lights, they are probably rather close to the camera, rather than at a large to very large distance.   Finally, if you look closely where the various objects fade out on the left and the right, you can trace out a cone of light in the image. You can\u2019t see the light, but it seems pretty clear that the objects are moving in and out of a cone of l! ight such as might be produced by a flashlight pointing straight up from the ground.  I don\u2019t know just what the objects are (at first I thought clusters of balloons, but they would have to be pretty small to be consistent with the hotel being out of focus. However, I don\u2019t have any hesitation calling this one a fake. Hope these comments help out. I have to say that I enjoyed the lights on the China video.

I live a mile west of the Las Vegas Strip, near the Palace Station casino.  The object seemed to be following Sahara Boulevard. I watched it for 20 seconds or so,  until my view was obstructed by trees.  I was unable to determine how high it was in the sky, or how large it was.  However, it appeared to be skirting the base of the clouds.  Because it was raining lightly, the clouds were lower than normal.  Several times it looked to me as if the object disappeared into the clouds for brief instants. Because of the light storm, wind was to the east.  The object was moving in a straight line into the wind, which immediately seemed odd to me.  I don't think a balloon would have traveled in a straight course against the wind. Less than a minute later, a helicopter traveled the same course, from east to west.  The helicopter was traveling at appx. the same speed as the object had been.  I could not tell if the helicopter was a news copter, a police copter, or some other type.  It wouldn't have been a tourist helicopter because they are restricted to the Strip.",

      "story": "Looked like a ship coming out of warp, lasted 1.5 seconds. Wasn't sure if I should report this due to the shortness of the event but the more I think about it the more I am sure it was a strange event. For geographic location, I am in the far north west of town in Las Vegas, Nv. We are far enough north of Vegas that we don't really get the light pollution like down in town so we have a very nice night sky. We had just gone through a week of clouds and overcast and this was our first clear sky in days and the 4rth of July we had clouds and rain all day/night. On Thursday July 3rd I was sitting out in my pool around 9:15ish pm. The sun had set but the sky was still in twilight and not dark yet. I was laying back looking up at the stars and checking out the constellations. When in the north sky I saw what I can only describe as a ship coming out of warp going from north to south.  It left a streak in the sky about a half inch long at arms length but it was a wide light like a highlighter rather than thin like a pencil. Now here is why I think this was weird. I spend a lot of time at night looking up at the sky, I know how falling stars look, I watch satellites go by  on a regular basis and I have seen the ISS over dozens of times and know its speed and brightness. In fact at 8:15ish pm I saw the ISS fly over (south to north) and fade out just like I had seen many times. Most every satellites I see here are usually going from south to north. Most falling stars I see are much faster and the streak is much longer and thinner. I am under the flight path for most military jets from Nellis AFB but they fly from the base to the training range (east to west) over my house then back a little north of me from West to East. Generally with a lot of noise and very identifiable by their lights and speed. In fact I was thinking earlier in the night that they were not out doing their regular night time training and the sky's were quiet that night. I never see flights from the north to the south due to two reasons.  The mountain range is very high to my north (Gass and Sheeps peek) and due north of me is actually area 51 and the groom lake complex. It is a No Fly zone for the normal training flights from Nellis.  Even the famed Janet airline flights don't do North to south, they do NW to SE to get to McCarran.  And don't fly evenings. So here is how this went down. I am in the pool laying back looking up at the stars and due to the way my yard and pool is I usually look north to it being the darker part of the sky. I heard what I thought was a plane, which drew my attention to an area I wasn't focusing on, when all of a sudden, I see this streak and at the leading edge of it is a bright shiny object. The streak was only half an inch long and appeared like the old star trek shows where they come out of warp and leave a short light trail. My first thought was a plane with landing lights but when the trail and light went away as fast as it appeared I looked to the area to the south thinking I would see the plane continue through the stars due to the sky still being in twilight but could not find it. This is seemed strange to me for the fact that nothing ever comes from our north to the south and the way the light looked. And I have never seen a falling anything from the North to the South.",

I was at home and outside having a cigarette when I looked up to the eastern sky and a bright sphere shaped object was stationary in the sky.  At first I thought, hum it\u2019s too bright during the afternoon for a star to be visible.  The object just appeared and didn\u2019t seem to originate from any direction.  It was a white yellowish in color and was brighter in appearance.  I went inside and got my Sony A330 DLSR with Sony 75-300mm lens.  As I got outside it was gone and I couldn\u2019t spot it but figured on keeping my camera if something else came around for a picture.  As a lawn care technician came to work on the yard sprinklers I looked to the northern sky and the bright object was there.  I mentioned it to him and in broken English said yeah I see it, and laughed a little bit.  I was able to get a few pictures of it but being a very small bright object in the sky that looked like a bright star.  I figured just a couple would do and I don\u2019t have video.  After wa! tching it for about 15 minutes, and It accelerated at amazing high rate of speed to the North and the object vanished.  Faster than any known aircraft I know of and rivals shooting stars and satellites.  The lawn care guy didn\u2019t hang around to watch but he got a look but I guess he had to get back to work.  Also not sure if the bright objects at different times are the same or different because I didn\u2019t see it move from the eastern sky to the northern sky. I am in the United States Air Force and living on Nellis AFB and I can watch aircraft from Nellis AFB coming and going, as well as the air traffic lanes for takeoff and landing from North Las Vegas Airport and McCarran International Airport are great reference.  All there is a commercial air traffic route over Las Vegas as well so I get to see a lot of different aircraft at different altitudes and speeds.",

I stood watching it for a few minutes trying to figure out its shape.  The shape seemed to be changing.  After about five minutes of traveling across the sky it stopped and appeared to be getting smaller.   I went inside and grabbed some binoculars.  I was able to get a better look at the shape.  It was a semi circle with two prongs coming out the front.  It seemed to be tumbling but every once in a while it would stop tumbling and you get a clear look at the shape.  It was definitely getting smaller-heading away I can only assume.  At one point a jetliner passed in front of my binocular view, and the object was way farther than that.

Getting my camera out was just to see if I could zoom in and see what it really was.   At the same time I told my wife there was something in the sky but thought it was a plastic bag but made the offer to come out and take a look.  The drift was almost like a sudden wobble and pause motion as it moved east.  In Northern Las Vegas it\u2019s pretty common to see a plastic bag or balloon caught in the wind.   What made this different was how bright it was at the same time I could see the direction of the wind due to the dust in the air with my sun glasses and it was traveling against the wind.   Once the bright object slowly made its way over Nellis AFB.  It accelerated at amazing high rate of speed to the south and the object vanished.  Faster than any known aircraft I know of and rivals shooting stars and satellites.

      "story": "UFO Captured Over North Las Vegas. Something that I initially thought was an airplane flew north going right past my house, but it wasn't making any noise and the red lights were a brilliant red and seemed larger than normal.  Within a couple of seconds it reversed direction for about a second or two right in its own path and then reversed again continuing on towards North Las Vegas and perhaps even Nellis Air Force Base.  That got me up and onto a raised cement slab near our fence so I could see better.  I was pretty pumped and shocked at the same time because it was clear right away that this was a UFO.  When you see it in 3D with your own eyes it looks much clearer and way easier to see than any video will show.  My adrenalin was definitely running. Anyway, I was fumbling around, trying to get my camera out of my pocket so I could try to film this thing.  By this time 45 seconds or more before has elapsed before I could start filming.  Being the novice I am, I used the screen on the phone camera to try and keep up with it.  I think that was a mistake because I kept losing the UFO, especially when it would dim in brightness.  I also zoomed in and out too much trying to see it better. I apologize for being so shaky but this might be a once in a lifetime event for me and I wanted proof. So anyway, the video speaks for itself and I welcome any comments or criticisms.  Whatever it was it was amazing!  I see a lot of aircraft living where I live including Air Force One when Obama comes to town but I have never seen something like this putting on a show like it did.  It also had to be moving pretty fast because it was at least 10 miles away and could be close to 20 miles away depending on where it was at times in the video. I also reported this to MUFON, case 55529.  I have already been contacted by the Regional Director (Nevada) for MUFON and told that it is being investigated.

I started to view this object in my binoculars, I had NO IDEA what it was BUT I knew it was a UFO , I gave the binoculars to my friend to clarify what I was viewing, he couldnt believe his own eyes.  The Ufo wasn't your typicall Disc/sosser, spinning rotating thing hovering in the sky.  What I seen through with these binoculars as clear as day look like a very scary black battleship cruiser hovering a few hundred feet over empty desert.  It didnt look friendly at all, the UfO was very sleek smooth an round! on top but the botton was really rigid and pointy . it looked like a seahorse on its side and not upright.  It was just very out of thisworld.  I drew a picture of the ufo looks nothing humane but after we seen it for a few minutes through the binoculars.  It just slowly disappeared Into the sunet.",

It also had on an irredescent cloak of some sort.  Its arms were longer than its dress.   As I made it around my bed - it stared at me.  It was less than 12 feet away and by the time I made it to my double doors, it lifted its long arm to the other arm and did something.   When I took two more steps...it disappeared.   I know what I saw was real and changed my belief.  Note:  Two weeks prior I kept hearing someone calling \"mom\" and nobody was there - I checked my kids and they were fine in bed.

On a night when you'd expect to see an array of lights, my family / group and I never expected to see what we saw over the trees to the southeast of our driveway. Seven of us, my wife, two daughters and three of their friends, all grown, were over and enjoyed the 4th's activities, when at 9 P.M. we went outside to watch the fireworks. I noticed one of our company looking into the nighttime sky to the southeast, when I looked up and saw a lit up object that seemed to be something other then fireworks.  It was just hovering bright and blue-green in color at first, then it moved ever so slowly and I thought it was a helicopter, meanwhile it had all of our attention by now, except my wife who went inside for something. It was then that the airborne craft started to move and made a sudden turn and as it did it began to fade and reappear as a bright reddish-orange color, turn back to the direction it had been visible as a blue-green object and darted back to it's original position in the sky that we had first noticed it.  There it turned back to to the blue-green and started to maneuver through the sky as something very different then fireworks or helicopter or anything that I've ever seen. I called for my wife to hurry back out side and look at this object. I called to her twice and finally asked her to drop whatever she was doing and please come now! (Meanwhile fireworks are going off all around us and this craft has our rapt attention)!  My wife came back out and immediately started to film it on her smartphone, we ended up with approx. seven minutes of video but during that time all we could do is watch this object in between the burst of the fireworks celebration which it seemed very int! erested in as it seemed to be drawn to the larger explosions. It continued to change color between the blue-green to red-orange as it changed direction or sped up and slowed down. It had a range of speed from just hovering to darting through the sky in an instant, ascending, descending at times and changing course at very unusual angles, sometimes slowly, other times quickly. We all thought about what it could be, a very different firework, a helicopter, a blimp, a drone, a prank somebody conceived because everyone in the neighborhood would be watching up into the nighttime sky and what a dupe or \"viral-video\" that would make but in the end none of these made any sense. As in the end it darted out a bit of instant, returned half the distance and started to descend beyond the trees and went out of sight. We all at some point thought it was a UFO and explained what we each saw and all agreed it wasn't anything like any of us had seen before. My wife later uploaded her video to her computer and we both understood why 99% of the videos you see of the UFO sightings are so grainy, you just don't expect to see something like this and when you do you use the best tool available to you to record it and in this case it was a smartphone. Aliens, I don't know. UFO, meaning that none of us in our group could identify it, yes. I'm just hoping to see something about this on the news tomorrow to verify what we saw wasn't a July fourth event the city of Las Vegas put on to wow it's citizens! We're hoping others saw this as there have had to be dozens of witnesses with it being the 4th of July and so many would have been looking into the sky enjoying the firework celebrations.

We were witness to a Triangular boomerang shaped object that hovered over the very top platform of the Orleans Hotel and Casino at 10:15pm or 22:15 for approximately 10 minutes.  It appeared solid white in color as it reflected the lights from the top of the casino, yet it didnt appear to be illuminated itself.  From where we were and the city noises around us, it did not make any identifiable sounds.  At first I thought it was either a remote controlled drone or large nocturnal  bird, but then after sizing it up against the surroundings, it had to have been around the size of a car.  It also didn't move like a bird,  but more like a object being controlled because its amazing maneuvering abilities such as hovered completely still for a long period of time (the full 10 minutes), tilting completely vertically for a! minute and then it shot off toward the south with speed that seemed as if it just vanished into thin air.   My friends were not as interested in the object as I was and looked away after a few minutes, missing the object taking off from its hovering position.  I wanted to report it to see if anyone else in the area witnessed this object or if maybe this was a drone of some sort.  Thank you.",

      "story": "Multiple white lights above the mountain ridge and traversing the mountain On 9/27/15 my wife and I were trying to watch the blood moon forming in the east.  Since it was very cloudy throughout most of the valley, I became a little bored and started to look around the sky.  Upon looking at the mountain behind our house I noticed a couple white dots hovering over the mountain.  I thought they were airplanes at first because that is a normal route that is used when they are coming in to land at McCarran Airport.  After a few minutes went by they still had not moved any closer and stayed in the same area.  I then noticed more lights appearing next to them, there were approximately 6-8 more lights that appeared right next to each other.  I was able to see the lights moving around from left to right and a few of them would disappear then reappear for the next few minutes.  After another minute went by we had seen more lights appear closer to us, but still over the mountain.  As this was happening we noticed what appeared to be lights comi! ng down the side of the mountain.  There were probably at least 30 objects moving down alongside the mountain.  As this was happening my wife started to freak out and pulled me inside of the house.  She started to have a panic attack so I had to tend to her for the rest of the night.  Where we viewed the objects moving down the mountain I did not know that there was trail that high up.  I had found this out the next day using google earth and verified that these lights were moving down that same trail.  We live approximately 300 ft. away from the mountain and will normally hear vehicles or off-road vehicles driving on the road below the trail.  There was no sound at all and the lights appeared to be hovering over the ground.  I also thought that they may have been people walking/running on the trail, but that didn\u2019t explain the lights hover above the mountain.  All of the lights seen were large and very bright; they were definitely bigger than a flashlight and probably bigger! than the size of a headlight.  They were definitely not flares or any other type of aircraft,   I was in the military and I know how planes and flares move.  The mountain I am referencing is called \u201cDesert Hills\u201d right in the corner of Blue Diamond Rd.  and Fort Apache Rd.",

It seemed light colored, and I think I only saw it because the moon was kinda bright and seemed to reflect some light off the object. As soon as I realized this object seemed strange,  I called to my roommate to look where I was looking.  He also saw it, before our view was blocked by my neighbor's tree.  He agreed it was very odd, and didn't have any lights on. It seemed pretty large and was moving at a good speed.  It was going in a straight line.

      "story": "Triangle shaped craft over Nevada Highway plus other red light craft First of all, we have never officially reported this sighting to anyone before.  We just told friends and family who all looked at us with scepticism.  After watching a UFO special where the reports on objects seen were very similar I decided to write a report. We are Australians.  (My husband and I and a close friend.)  We were traveling by RV from Oregon to Las Vegas in October 2008.  On the day in question, we were driving from Mono Lake to Vegas and cut across to Highway 95.  On the way to 95 we blew a tyre which had to be changed.  This delayed us so by the time we got to highway 95 it was getting dark.  We stopped for gas then continued south. The map showed a large military base to the east of the highway.  I joked with the others saying 'wouldn't it be fun if we saw a UFO around here?'.  In all our USA travels over 20 years, we'd never seen a UFO before.  We laughed about it and kept going south.  It had become completely dark and I estimate it was around 7 or 8pm. My husband was driving the A class RV (bus style front with huge windscreen).  We were going fairly slow enjoying the drive - normal amount of traffic.  I was in navigator seat and our friend was behind on the couch.  My husband who is quite observant, was looking out the window and at the stars as we drove.  It was a clear night and stars were clearly visible. A few minutes later he slowed right down.  He was looking up through the windscreen and said 'the stars have all disappeared.  Do you see that above us?'.  I looked up and our friend looked out the side window.  We all saw that the stars were no longer visible.  We pulled over to the side of the road and stopped.  By this time we could see that there was a large black object over the top of the RV that was blocking the stars.  We were all saying, 'What is that?' to each other. As soon as we stopped, our friend opened the door and we all got out of the RV. We then looked up and got a better idea what was above us.  It was a large, gun metal black triangular craft. It was moving very slowly, almost hovering over us.  It was huge - we estimated about the size of a football field.  We could only make out how big it was by the far corners as they had small blinking lights.  The lights are what made my husband think the craft was man made rather then extra-terrestrial. Also there was absolutely no noise coming from the craft.  No engine noise at all. Our friend went around to the back of our RV and climbed the ladder to stand on top of the RV to get a closer look.  It was really low - perhaps only 30 feet up.  It was over us for a few minutes then it kept drifting slowly east and gradually got faster.  Then, it got instant speed (like something you'd see on Star Trek's warp drive) and instantly flew out and over the horizon. In the distance were some hills (where the military base was marked on the map).  Once the craft disappeared we could see flashes of light coming from behind the hills kind of like lightning or weapon explosions.  These continued for a while. As we were discussing what we'd seen, three other objects started flying around.  Marked by three red lights, the three objects flew in formation together.  They moved in angular motion - angles, up and down, round, back and forward and zig zag.  They didn't fly like any normal craft you would recognise.  Again, they didn't seem to make any sound but they were further away than the first ship had been.  Really all we could see of them were three bright red lights - each light a separate object.  We watched them for about half an hour amazed at what we were seeing.  Eventually they seemed to leave the area.  As time was moving on we got back into the RV and took off slowly down the road still watching the sky. A short while later the three craft / red lights reappeared.  We stopped again, got out and watched them.  They did the same kind of manouvers as the first time. All in all, they disappeared and came back again about 4 times in total.  This all took place over the space of about 2.5 hours and over a distance of less than ten miles (that we travelled).  Then, the last time we saw the three lights/synchronized craft) they seemed to drop regular red coloured flares which went to the ground.  They then left the area.  A few minutes later two regular military jet aircraft flew over the area and into the distance over the hills.  Then nothing further happened. Amazed we eventually got going again and drove the rest of the way to Vegas, getting in around 11pm.  We sat up most of the night discussing and dissecting everything we'd seen just to make sure none of us were crazy!  We ended up assuming they were some kind of craft owned by the military but they were certainly nothing like anything we'd ever seen.  My husband worked in the Australian defense department in Canberra for years and had seen classified aircraft over the years but nothing like this.  Our friend who was with us is a computer/electric vehicle expert but still had never seen anything like these craft or the way they operated. I was surprised that nobody else stopped on the highway or seemed to see them.  I guess most people are busy and in their little world unlike us who were moving slow and observant whilst on our holiday.  So I hope you find this report of interest.  I've tried to explain it all as logically as I could.   P.S.--We had no video camera with us.  Our friend tried to take photos of the black craft but being black on a black sky in the dark, none came out so we have no photographic evidence.  Even though this happened a few years ago now, it's very fresh in all our minds.   It was an incredible experience.",

      "story": "While driving on 95S, i saw a triangle with an inverted bottom, outlined in chasing white lights hovering/bobbing above Santa Fe casino I live in the Centennial Hills area of Las Vegas, NV.  This is the northwest. I was traveling to work southbound on the 95 freeway.  I was late for work.  I always watch the skies.  I don\u2019t know why, it's not like I ever see anything.  On 1/5/2016 between the hours of 9:25pm and 9:45pm, I actually did.  As I passed the Santa Fe Casino, on my left, right above the casino I witnessed a triangular V-shaped object over the casino.  I cannot remember if it was over the parking garage area or closer to the casino part.  I am not sure.  What I am sure of, however, is that I was seeing a V-shaped aerial object.\u00a0\u00a0   The object that I saw was \"hovering\" in the air, as low as a helicopter could fly.  (I have had airplanes fly by or helicopters sit idle near me and I hear a sound)  This object was\u00a0 emitting absolutely NO sound. It was close enough for me to hear a sound.  I would have heard a sound.  Were this a helicopter or an airplane, I'm sure I would have heard sound.  I thought maybe it was some type of military stealth flying object.  But why would it be just hovering Non-stealthily over the nasty old Santa Fe Casino?  Also I saw lights.  I cannot say for sure what other colors I saw besides white.  White was the dominant color, I do know that for sure.  There could have been other colors as well.  What I can say for absolute assurity is that the lights were chasing.  Chasing like those Christmas lights that people have.  The lights were chasing in the shape of the object that I was seeing, which was a V shape (acute triangle) two long sides with a shorter bottom.  The bottom was invert! ed to another v.\u00a0\u00a0    As I was seeing this, my psyche attempted to explain away my optical.  The reason I was unsuccessful at explaining this away, was because of the motion of the object.  As it hovered in that spot, it rotated at a half circle as it bobbed up and down slightly, while slightly tilted to the right.  The movement of the craft, the location of the craft and the fact that I could hear no sound from a craft that was in such close proximity to my vehicle are the reasons why I am writing this report.  The behavior of the craft frightened me more than the sight of it.  I felt an immediate fear mixed with excitement mixed with dread mixed with sadness.  A combination of feelings that I have never felt.\u00a0 \u00a0  Please be advised that I was driving when I witnessed this.  I pulled to the carpool lane and started to drive very slowly to ensure that I was seeing what I was seeing.  I started to swerve cause I was looking at the object instead of looking at the road.  I turned away to keep from getting pulled over for a traffic violation.  I was afraid to stop and pull over. This happened to me.  I do not have any history of mental illness.  I have never made a report of something like this before.  I believe in the existence of something other than human beings for several reasons that I will not go into, because that is not what this report is for.   I just want whoever this gets to, to\u00a0 take my accounts seriously.  I am a previous member of law enforcement.  I have had to listen to reports like this frequently from crazy people.  I know the difference.  I hope you do too.\u00a0 I know what I saw.  I just would like someone to tell me why I saw it.",

Didn't think much because the bus stop is near a airport and helicopter pad, but then I notice that the way it move could not have been either since it was moving in a wired motion.  Soon one orb got bright then the other and then the other dies out.  Then 2 more showed up and the one that Burt out showed itself again.  I watched for 15 minutes straight watching.

When I noticed some electrical interference at my house with the lights flickering.  I had a feeling that I was being observed and happen to look around.  While looking around I glanced up into the sky and saw a black triangle in shape with 4 lights hovering above my house.  No sounds were aminating (sic.  emanating) from the craft.  The distance about (sic.  above??) my house was approximate a football field in length.   I watched the craft for between ten to fifteen minutes it hovered.  I grabbed my phone and from the inside and my dog noticed the object hovering and he started barking at it.  Once I grabbed my phone I took a photo of the object and continued to watch it as it vanished into thin air. I have experience in law enforcement and I have military experience as well.  This object clearly wasn't of this earth and I don't not want to have the photo released due to being ruined if I'm questioned or have my career jeopardized. I did enhance the photo that was taken and it was clear as day that it was a triangle with 4 different lights on the object.  No blinking lights that are common on current regulated aircraft.",

      "story": "There were five of us laying on top of a shed roof looking at the stars listening to the radio and talking about how we had the whole summer to play because school was out.  We were 5 boys  I will not use our names  But B was the youngest at about 9 years old S and G were both were about 12 and R was about 16 and K was the oldest at about 17 years.   B woke me up and was scared pointing in the direction of the UFO and he looked frightened I tried to calm him down in case he fell off the roof so that we would not get into trouble because he was the youngest and our parents would go ballistic and we were all in sleeping blankets on a small roof which made it hard to move around.  He was just pointing behind me and saying what is that, what is that, what is that light and I heard a voice that said in English calm him down and tell him everything will be OK and it was a very Authority like voice in my head and while I was trying to calm him down he was pointing over my shoulder and I turned and there it was the craft I have mentioned.  R one of the older boys was suspended in the air flat as a board still in his sleeping blanket.  I just stared at it and B was still behind me waiting for me to do something about the situation.  I was just memorized by the black bulb where the voice seemed to telepathically emanate from because it was still telling me not to panic and everything was going to be OK, no harm was going to be done to us, they were not going to kill us or take us and I felt calm and was just focused on it and not B who was just huddled behind me.  I started asking it questions with my thoughts and not my mouth on what they were and what they wanted and why did they have R floating near them.  It told me a lot of information very quickly and I cannot remember all of it, but what I could gather is that they lived a million billion zillion miles away and have been around a long time and we were not that important to them supposedly because we were like flakes of skin in that we had a purpose or function, but it was not a great importance, as the brain is, compared to flakes of skin (I hope this makes sense remember I was only 12 and this was 1982)  I started asking lots of questions as in, because why and I do not understand and explain it to me and then I felt B panicking and yelling again because he was frightened for me because to him I was just silently sitting there staring at the craft and as I looked across the shed I wondered why no one else was awake but us two and the voice told me to just go back to sleep and not to worry about B and that is the last thing I remember until the sun woke us up at around 5 to 6 six in the morning. We all got off the shed and headed back to the house B started asking everyone what happened the older boys told him very angrily to shut up about it and when we went into the house and went back to sleep and we slept for at least 18 to 24 hrs. and our parents tried to wake us because they thought we were sick or something because we should! be running around watching television and playing.  We never really talked about it to anyone else as far as I remember and it was just put aside like nothing happened because we were OK so what was there to complain about. It reminded me of the old Bell H 13 Helicopter from the TV show Mash but a little longer tail section mixed with the look of a small submarine like the SEAmagine Aurora.  It had a large black glass bulb in front with a metal structure as the tail with real bright white lights maybe 4 like flood lights.  It just hovered about 15 - 20 feet away from us made no noise. The black glass bulb front was real BLACK as in a real shiny Onyx stone.  The metal looking tail structure where the lights were looked more like the outer structure of a small sub or helicopter because it had the lights attached there and sort of metal beams like the helicopter tail but stuck to the body of a small submarine but hard to make out because of the bright flood lights blocking my eyesight from that body and tail section.  The front had no lights just this big black glass bulb as seen on the helicopter or small submarine and if anyone was sitting in it   I would guess the bulb part could hold 2 people comfortably.  The body or tail section once again hard to tell because of the lights but was not too big so maybe another two people.  The whole craft was about the same dimensions as the Bell H 13 helicopter.  The Glass bulb part was Black and the body was a dull gray metal. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

      "story": "observed green star moving from the right to the left below the constellation of Leo through telescopes Our local astronomical group visited Star Hill near Las Vegas, New Mexico, in November 1996 and November 1998 and stayed 10 days on each trip.  I got my 8 inch telescope ready for viewing the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, which comes up above the horizon at Star Hill at approximately 3:20 am local time on the morning of the 19th of November 1998.   At 2:30 am, I was below the star Regulus and heading towards the three galaxies known M105, M96, and M96.  I spotted a green star moving slowly against the background of stars in my finder.  I switched over to my 8 inch telescope and easily picked up the object.  This green star object was moving from my right  to my left along a straight line south of Leo. After about 5 minutes, I hollered out, \"Boys, I am tracking a moving object.\"  Quickly three more telescopes were set up and started tracking the object.  Soon all 18 members of our group looked through these 4 telescopes and everyone was able to see and track this slow moving object. According to my notes, the object stopped moving several times.  Then moved south a short distance, then stopped, paused, then resumed moving straight ahead.  Basically we were still south of the constellation of Leo.   After about 3/4 of an hour of viewing, the other members grew tired and walked away to their own telescopes.  I continued viewing.  At 3:19 am, the green star stopped, then moved south a small distance, and stopped at another green star, or merged with, or went behind, this new green star.   As I am observing, I was calling out to everyone else what was happening, or not happening, with this green star.  At approximately 3:35 am, something  dramatic happened.  Two  missile-like objects came through the field of view.  These objects flew on a course from the southwest to the northeast.  One object went to the left of the green star and the other object went to the right of the green star.  A white streak followed these objects.  These objects moved very quickly through the field of view.  I continued to observe this green star until 4 am.   I grew tired and turned my attention to the Virgo cluster, which was well up by now.  However, I drew a diagram o! f the star field around where the green star finally stopped moving.  Basically, we were close to the border of Leo and Virgo constellations.",

I pulled over and got out of my car and continued to watch as it got higher in the western sky,  it remained reddish orange and appeared to vary in intensity like a fire or flare that flickers, sort of like seeing a campfire at a great distance. Then the object slowed and appeared to hover and meander a bit in it's position.  Then it slowly reversed course and headed back towards the west-northwest, and at the same time it changed course it also dimmed greatly and became hard to see, and now appeared whitish and very dim, slowly fading to where I could no longer see it. I tried to get in on video but it had already turned NW and cant see it on the video. Its initial direction of travel was about 130 degrees, after it changed course it appeared to head about 310 degrees. My direction of travel was about 360 degrees, and I initially saw the object at about a 270 degrees, directly towards the Spring Mountains. It reminded me of a high altitude rocket, Ive seen a lot of rockets out of Vandenberg when I was younger.  But this object varied in speed and direction, unlike any rocket I've seen. I saw something like this about a year ago, in the same general area but it was out farther northwest of Las Vegas towards the Desert National Wildlife Refuge.",

It just hovered a ways up in the sky, but I could not tell what exactly it was over, couldn't see that far.  Very gradually it began to rise eventually, very slowly.   When I looked through the binoculars, it looked like a cylindrical or rectangle shape with red, white and blue light, in bands.  Very bright.   When I looked through the night vision it appeared to be a cube and appeared to be rotating rapidly!  Completely different without night vision, as then it appeared stationary.   The dawn was breaking and it kept rising in the sky, but very slowly, straight up.  I kept watching until it finally couldn't be seen anymore due to a cloud it went into, about an hour all told.

I was working the night crew for Sam Boyd Stadium, and earlier, I heard of a fire ball in ths sky that.  came from the wetlands where all the citys water runs back into lake mead.  A coworker said I missed it, but he said it hovered the exploded into a fire ball.  He said he thought it was a flare but then when it cMs ovst the butler building he thought it was a missel or a millitary rocket.  But when it got closer it looked like a fite ball or orb.  Then exploded as it took off and left real fast.  I didnt see it yet.  But as we were gking on break walking to the shop.the butler building the maintenance shop.  The orb was not a missel or a rocket. It got really close and I stood in amazement.  And it was glowing like a fire all around. It kind of look like a jApanese lantern but nothing like those japanese kites or lanterns.  It looked like it had 4 jet streams spinning in.a circle and A 5 jet stream pointing down the ground.  It was really amazing.becausr the top of it! looked like an optapus head or it was oval.with a sharp point tip like a tent but what I could describe it it looked like an insect or felt like it was a living organism and I.could feel.it like.it could sence me and gave me the chills.  It wasnt like the metalic space crafts you hear or see on tv lr nothing like the normal ufo sightingz.  The firery orb seemed more like a living organism and glowed and fiery orange or amber type of glowing live flames or real .fire.  It was real quite and made no sound.  Then it flew around the stadium around the west where I stood almost as close to the light poles then flew around the south end.  Then we All went on break.  The sighting I.believe they live in the wetlands behind sam boyd stadium.  Because it came from the mountains behind the stadium. Sam boyd elevation is one of the lowest part of the vegas valley.  Plus I think.now that the wetlands preserve is undergoing construction with the hicking trail.  Alot of construction and bulldozers are channeling.the water and the water detention basin to get the wetlands to flow.  I.think they are messing up with the naturL process of nature of the desert of this aetland oasis. . Maybe this ufo lives in the waters or lake mead.

Returned to bed. 3:30 am  \tAwakened by a rustling noise in the kitchen/living room area that sounded like the dog prancing around when he gets excited.  She thought maybe the dog & cat were playing.  She called the dog, and he came into the bedroom in an excited state with his ears perked up and his attention was directed towards where he had come from. She continued to hear the rustling sound (sort of like fast, small footsteps) coming from the kitchen, and assumed that it must be the cat.  She moved her body, and realized the cat was actually laying on the bed.  This cat normally reacts with curiosity when someone outside the family comes in the house, but she uncharacteristically decided not to investigate the noises, although she clearly heard them too. Realizing she can\u2019t blame the noise on any of the animals (and her son is asleep in bed with her), she became afraid that an intruder was in the house.  She actually considered getting her gun. Just after having that thought, an extremely bright light coming from outside brightened up the room, completely taking her mind off the mysterious kitchen sounds.  Lying in her bed and looking out her window, she could see the underneath side of an enormous UFO that reminded her more of the Star Trek Enterprise because of its detailing and multiple shapes rather than the stereotypically shaped UFO.  It was grayish cream in color with many white lights.  Her position made it impossible to see the entire craft until it moved away. The round sections had inner soft, circular contoured bevel (like molding).  The square section was outlined with lights, and its inner part was flat and non-descript.  There was a hazy appearance around the ship. She recalled having the presence of mind to think \u201cI have to try and remember lots of details, because Mom will ask a million questions.\u201d  And \u201cLots of people have to be witnessing this!\u201d  It was hovering very low when she initially saw it, then it moved in a very slight eastward direction before it stopped.  It remained stationary for no more than 20 seconds allowing her to see the entire underneath side of the ship. It then shot off at a tremendous speed in a southeast direction with a slightly increased altitude, causing her to sit up in bed for a better look.  Where and when it disappears from sight, she witnessed a distant lightning strike & flash/halo of haze and light around the area where it disappeared.  She mentioned that even if this was actual lightening, her perception was that it was far enough away that she wouldn\u2019t have expected to hear thunder. While this was going on in the sky, she heard moaning off & on outside as if someone was in pain. Time?  \tEverything went back to normal.  She wanted to check the kitchen, but oddly fell back asleep.  Her sleep was fitful, because the largest knuckle on her index finger of her left hand started hurting. 5:50 a.m.\t  Woke up and took her thyroid medication which was on her nightstand. 6:00 a.m.\t  Her alarm goes off.  She turned the TV on in her bedroom expecting to see a news report about the UFO.  There was none, and this frustrated her, because it was so large (football field size); people had to witness this. 6:50 a.m.\t  Got out of bed and went into the kitchen (which is extremely small in dimension and just enough room to turn around).  A lower cupboard door is wide open.  She could not have missed this detail on her 2:35 a.m. trip to the kitchen.  Neither of the animals could have done this.  Her son never woke up during the night. 9:30 a.m.  \tTook her jacket off at work, and the motion made her finger start hurting again. She can feel a very small bump.  It is slightly purple and feels like bruise.  It continued to hurt at the end of her workday and the time of this writing. She claims to have had the intuitive feeling during the whole episode that this experience \u201cwasn\u2019t for her\u201d.  But, if it wasn\u2019t directed at her, she wonders why something was happening in her kitchen.  She said that she has never experienced anything like this.  She tried to reason that it must have been a dream, because it is too preposterous to be anything else.  At the same time, she knows it happened.  She said that her odd reaction of easily going back to sleep was disturbing, and that she felt like she had experienced psychological gaslighting.",

      "story": "Multiple UFOs, some &quot;Pyramid&quot; shaped that changed orientation (tumbling), some &quot;Stars&quot;.  All were white. I was sunning by the pool at our building in Las Vegas, at the start of a short holiday (because our choice resort in St. Martin was destroyed).  I was looking up, mostly watching the helicopters and planes departing LAS.  Then, I saw the first object. I saw a bright white UFO, moving slowly.  Then I saw the second one.  Then, the first dropped 3 objects from it.  The 3 new UFOs looked like \u201cstars\u201d, except it was about noon, with a blazing sun, so stars wouldn't have been visible.  I thought they might be weather balloons. But, then I realized that one of the larger objects, moved at a MUCH faster rate, than the UFO \u201cmother\u201d ship that dropped the three \u201cstars\u201d.  So, they couldn't be balloons, or they would all be moving at about the same rate, in the same direction.  Plus, they didn't look like balloons.  They looked like \u201cpyramids\u201d and \u201cstars\u201d.  When I saw the three objects falling from the mother ship, I thought it might be a plane, dropping jumpers. But, I realized, it was not a plane. As the first object got closer (more overhead), I could see it was sort of a pyramid shape, but the orientation changed, as the UFO \u201ctumbled\u201d. It did not stay in a constant orientation, like an airplane. The 3 dropped \u201cstars\u201d, moved slowly \u201cbelow\u201d the mother ship. They didn't drop quickly, like jumpers, which was another reason I realized they were not skydivers. Then, they stopped \u201cdropping\u201d, and moved along with the mother ship, in a roughly North-South orientation.  The four UFOs moved slowly, in more or less the same North-South direction. The larger one was the \u201cpyramid\u201d shaped one, with the three \u201cstars\u201d following. Then, I noticed more of the \u201cstar\u201d UFOs. I saw about 7-8 more. They were in a second group, behind the first four, but all moved about the same direction and roughly the same speed. Sometimes, some of the UFOs would stop, and be stationary for a while, but eventually they mostly moved off in the same North-South direction. After some minutes, one of the \u201cstar\u201d UFOs suddenly moved at VERY high speed, in the opposite direction of the others, Northerly.  During this whole UFO time period, I saw probably about 7 airplanes. That helped me judge the speed and behavior of the UFOs. Most of the UFOs were moving MUCH slower than the aircraft, except for the one \u201cstar\u201d UFO that started moving the opposite direction. It was going about four times faster than any of the other aircraft I saw, and some of them were high-altitude jets moving at their normal speed.  Another of the \u201cstar\u201d UFOs was moving about 120 degrees away from the direction of the movement of the others (Northeasterly). As it moved away, it slowly turned as it moved, about 90 degrees to the left, so it ended up moving at about a 30 degree angle from the direction of the others (Southeasterly).  Then I saw another group of around 8 \u201cstar\u201d UFOs. They were largely moving right-to-left, North-South, as most of the previous UFOs had before. When one or more moved more overhead, again I could see the \u201cpyramid\u201d shape, with the continuously changing orientation. The rest looked like stars. They appeared to move to the South, in the direction of the Sun. I think that they were climbing, as well as moving roughly North-South, as they got close to the Sun.  Later, one of the \u201cstar\u201d UFOs moved off at about a 45 degree angle path away from the main direction of most of the UFOs, and disappeared moving in that direction (southeasterly). Then, I saw one of the \u201cstar\u201d UFOs moving away from the track of the others: It looked like it was mostly climbing up, away from the path of the previous UFOs. But, this one was changing in visual intensity dramatically. Sometimes, it could barely be seen, but then it changed to very bright, much brighter than any of the other UFOs, then back to looking like a \u201cstar\u201d, like most of the other UFOs. It was changing in brightness at random intervals, the whole time I saw this UFO.  After this, I saw one more of the \u201cstar\u201d UFOs. In total, the experience lasted about 45 minutes, and I saw about 20 UFO objects.  They weren't weather balloons, airplanes or helicopters. They weren't drones or RC planes, and not anything publicly acknowledged in a current military inventory.  Note: I was a USAF pilot, and am now an airline pilot.",

      "story": "UFO Sighting in Las Vegas, NV - Spring Valley area Tuesday, September 25th, 2018:  Whenever I stand out on my balcony, I get a pretty good view of the mountains going west on the 215 freeway.  I can tell you that I have never seen anything like what I saw today.  I noticed a bright light or reflection of some sort coming from what seems like the edge of one of the mountains.  I called my fianc\u00e9 out onto the balcony to come take a look, and we immediately started recording. Since we could not zoom in enough to be able to appreciate exactly what it was, we remembered we have high quality binoculars.  We grabbed them and took a closer look.  When we were able to focus on the object, we noticed that it had one large light in the middle, and two smaller ones on each side.  We are not sure if what we saw were 3 separate objects, or if it was just one craft.  However, what we can say is that the object was out in the open at 3:00PM in bright daylight, and these lights were beaming so bright.  It was not a reflection of anything as there is NOTHING else on those mountains. We are about 25 miles away from the location where the object seemed to be, so we got into our car and decided to drive a little closer.  As we started driving, we realized that the closer we got, the object seemed to be less visible.  We pulled into a parking lot, and we were able to grab someone's attention and asked them if they had any idea what the object sitting on the mountain was.  This woman said she has lived in Las Vegas for over 30 years, and has never seen anything like it.  We decided to head back home. Unfortunately, when we got back to our house.  We noticed that there was smoke or dust coming from the area where the object was seen.  We did not capture that on camera.  The object had seemed to move to the left, and was still a bit visible. However, left a cloud of dust or smoke behind.  We went out onto our balcony later that night, and this morning, and there is nothing out there now.  Not sure what we saw, but we have footage and pictures which we will be uploading to YouTube. ((NUFORC Note:  Good photo shows 3 lights, sitting on a distant ridgeline.  PD))",

At 7:56PM on July 21, 2018, I was having a cigarette outside of St. Rose Dominican hospital in the southwest part of Las Vegas, NV, when I saw what I belive is some new aircraft being tested near town.  I was looking to the southwest the right way at the right time to see a plane I think.  I do know however it was the fastest thing I've ever seen move through the air.  It was the same color as the night sky yet had a greyness to it due to the city lights bouncing off the bottem or \"belly.\"  I've flown my whole life, so I tried looking for all the usual suspects, vertical stabilizer(s)?  No.  Has some kind of fighter front end.  Intakes exhausts?  No.  Maybe a hint of a delta shape with a flat \"stealthy\" single point kinda like an F-117.  No sound none!  I was watching airliners depart the valley at the class B boundry.  A new plane type looked to me like it  was transitioning from class c (or uncotrolled airspace) to class bravo and close to commercial traffic.  He made whatever airliner that was look like he was standing still.  He was also higer in altitude than the traffic off his left... may I say wing?  I watched him fly over the horizon.  Not a sound at a speed I never seen before.  He flew right over my head I caught him when my head was about 80 degrees to already be watching airplanes so I saw him really good and for a time.  No lights of anykind this aircraft I dont think anyone would know it, if it was flying treetop level over there head's right now that quiet and that dark.  I'm proud I got to see such a thing.",

Her husband got out his phone and took the picture presented with this initial report. If you zoom in to on the picture you can see the shape of the object.  The object remained there with glowing lights until they passed by and could no longer see it.  When they first noticed the object they thought it was a reflection, but as they approached they realized it took on a shape.  They were about 35-40 minutes out of Las Vegas on a Spirit Airline flight and noticed the object out the window on her left side, above the wing.  (MUFON CMS)",

About 300' to 500' above my RV rectangular shaped mass with red lights slowly floated by.I went outside the RV to watch it float by. I thought this might be a blimp but no blimp above the rectangle of red lights. I ran back into the RV to get my phone for a video. I shot two videos of the lights. The first also has the humming vibration in the audio. The humming noise did not match any airborne craft, plane, or helicopter I had ever heard. Plus it drifted very slowly. it was amazing how slow it could go and still stay elevated. I watched it as it floated towards the lights of Las Vegas along inter state 15 South. As it grew smaller 2 white lights which sounded like fighter jets went/chased in the same direction as the red flashing rectangle.Approx 8:55pm on 10/23/19",

Then we saw the helicopter move its spotlight towards the ground and it flew out of sight.  For the next 30 minutes we heard helicopters flying overhead, but saw no lights at all.

This sighting took place on one of the busiest streets of the United States of America, above Las Vegas Boulevard in Las Vegas, Nevada at about 8:40PM, on December 14, 2019. The sighting was right above the Luxor Pyramid at the large beam of light. The Lights we saw were 100x brighter than that of the Luxor\u2019s, very noticeable difference.  What started off as three bright lights? We all stared and saw the lights move, and multiply. At that moment I was terrified as the lights seamed to scatter. The UFO lights moved and multiplied very  quickly, in a matter of a second, it  made the sky look like it was going to fill-up with UFO lights, as if we were going to be taken over in an invasion.  As the lights multiplied, it moved into a two rows, just like the Lubbock Lights, very uniform. Then the 40 plus lights moved into a bird formation, literally, into a silhouette formation of a large bird, it, the formation then in sync, flapped its two wings, and moved in a natural bird motion. When the flapping stopped, it then it disappeared into the Luxor Hotel Light on the strip of Las Vegas. It seemed like a helicopter was monitoring the lights. After the sighting the Helicopter was heard hovering and circling the air space, as if it were looking to the UFO.",
