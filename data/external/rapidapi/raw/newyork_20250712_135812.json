      "story": "1965 Dark Grey Cylinder UFO Updated Statement I just wanted to offer an updated version, the original being:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/025/S25728.html  \"Every now and then, my mother and I would take our dog on his night walk to the Parade Ground, a flat park of baseball and football fields. We went there because at the time it was being renovated, and the fields were being partitioned and fenced. This gave us some confidence to allow the dog off the leash to run free for a change.  The Parade Ground is just across Parkside Avenue from Prospect Park. It is August, 1965. I am ten years old.  The dog was having a good run, and once we saw that he wasn't about to run off completely, we relaxed and gazed upwards to view the night sky, trying to find various constellations.  In those days, the street lights in Brooklyn emitted a white light, and not the beige-looking type now in use. If you went to a park, you could get a decent view of the stars, but of course not anywhere near the view if you were upstate in deep woods.  Suddenly, as I looked to the left of me, I saw what I first mentally equated as a submarine perhaps two storeys off the ground higher than the six storey buildings beneath it.  \"Hey Mom, do you see what I see?\" She did.  Here comes this thing, slow and steady and silent. It is huge. It is dark grey - not \"battleship grey,\" but as grey as can be before you rule it black. There is no shine to it.  The front of it was round; I'd seen pictures of submarines, and that is what came to mind. It is actually shaped more like a very long medicine capsule.  As it  proceeded to float past us, we observed its right side. It is solid. It is a perfect and very long dark grey cylinder, and it just keeps coming very slowly and steadily.  Obviously, we can't see the top of it, but so far, we see that even though it is almost black, we sense a light behind the darkness. This does not make sense, as my mother and I later reckoned. The best I can come up with is that my eyes saw dark grey, but my mind knew the cylinder was emitting light. Dark light!  This was no blimp. No lights. No sound. No windows. No gondola beneath. No visible markings. No nothing! It is just a cylinder 300 feet longer than the Intrepid aircraft carrier now docked in the Hudson River going by!  This thing was so huge, that even from the height above me, (200 Feet?) it was clearly visible; visible enough to see even the slightest imperfection clearly, if it had any.  At the same time, we are not in any panic. We are unusually serene. As if it's no big deal somehow. Maybe we were in a stupor beyond awe.  Finally, the end of the ship passes. I ran to see the back of it. I see it is as round as the front with an opening in the center. To this day, I'm not sure if it was square or arch-like. I am convinced that at least the bottom of the opening in the back of it was flat, so it was square or arched. I remember thinking that 3 buses could easily drive inside at the same time. On the other hand, I've seen jets low to the ground on approach to JFK Airport, and thought that \"my\" cylinder was at least 3 times wider at the same height.  This is the only time I experience apprehension. I worry for a moment that whoever is flying this cylinder might see me.  I ran to a to where I could see the other side of the cylinder. It is exactly as perfect and unremarkable as the other side and the bottom.  I have been struggling with my memories for years as to whether there was a single tiny light, blue or red atop the opening in the back. I add this item, but I am not sure. Inside the opening it is absolutely pitch black.  The cylinder was in the order of 1200 feet long. I did not know this at the time. When I saw the cylinder completely, it was \"crossing\" Stratford Road, and the back of it was at Buckinham Road. The distance between these streets on Caton Avenue according to street maps is about 1200 feet.  I rejoined my mother in the original field, and we watched this thing float over the Prospect Park POLICE STATION, heading west until it faded from sight about half a mile west of the Parade Ground. No newspaper, radio, or TV station mentioned it. For that matter, we didn't even tell my father!  As I first accessed the Internet, I ran a search for \"cylinder ufo,\" and plenty of links came up. Even pictures! I wasn't too surprised, because I know damn well what I saw was real, and other people MUST have seen something as well.  I told some close friends. They gave me the jaundiced eye. I could hardly blame them. I guess its just one of those things one must see to believe.\"  Notes:  The Cylinder crossed over Parade Place, and was equidistant between Woodruff and Crooke Avenues.  The Cylinder was about 1/4 the width of the Parade Ground, and travelling in a straight line over the road that runs nearly the length of the park.  Why these single lane streets are designated Avenues is a mystery to me, especially Crooke Avenue, which runs only two blocks.  Modern street maps have re-named Buckingham Road as East 16th street. The equivalent for Stratford Road would be East 11th Street, so by my point of view the cylinder was at least five blocks in length. I need to remark that some internet-based street maps would put the length of the cylinder at 1500-1700 feet. I really should go back there and take measurements myself.",

      "story": "V-shaped translucent object seen near the moon during the eclipse I'm writing this email to tell you about an interesting occurrence I (and three others) had as we were outside to view the eclipse of the moon in NYC on November 8th, 2003. As I was looking up at the orange-shaded moon waiting for the last sliver of it to be covered, I noticed a strange V-shaped pattern, or triangular shaped pattern of lights moving in the sky. I believe my comments, along with some of the others, were: \"What's that?\" \"..that triangular shaped thing? \"Do you see that?\" We were all mystified.  This V-shaped object was extremely high up in altitude, higher than any plane I've ever seen flying, and moved just under the moon, towards it, then disappeared. It had about 8 round Shapes (probably lights, though it was too high up for me to see the illumination of these lights).  There were about four round shapes on each limb of the 'V' shape, and the whole shape seemed somewhat translucent.  Many planes had passed through the crisp crystal-clear sky as I was viewing the moon for a duration of about 15 minutes. All of the other planes had very bright lights, took routine pathways and were easily identified as planes. This V-shaped, triangular object was quite different from the planes. It had more lights on it than a plane and the lights appeared transparent or translucent. And, it was so high up that it appeared as if it was the same distance as the moon!  Then, it disappeared  as it seemed to fly towards the moon. This triangular, V-shaped object was something else!  I remember thinking that possibly a V-formation of ducks could be traveling (but in the dark at night). Perhaps, we (Earthlings) weren't the only beings sending good vibrations to the Universe during the Harmonic Concordance that night??  Regards, ((name deleted))",

      "story": "Object Produces Vortex of Clouds It was a warm day in the middle of June. My brother and I were working in our backyard, suddenly my brother said: \"Look over there- What is that?\"  To my shock there was a black object in the sky repeatedly doing circular patterns in the direction of the Verrazano Bridge, and hard to determine at what altitude.  As it did this a vortex of gasseous vapor appeared from where the oject was moving, the vapor continued spreading out and the object repeated the maneuvers.  About 10 minutes later a sudden and powerful thunderstorm came, and lasted for about 15-20 minutes.  Afterwards the sky cleared up and there was no sign of the object.  My brother and I are both positive that the vortex of clouds and most likely the thunderstorm originated from this object.

To check if it was a helicopter from the police or the army (it was during the Memorial week) I took a picture and when I looked at it, I was a bit surprised to see something looking like a rose flying donut. I don\u2019t know what is was, probably just an advertising donut balloon ???  5 to 10 seconds later (necessary time to look at the first picture), I decided to take another one but the flying object had disappeared.

I was in the park with my wife and daughter and laying on my back staring up the swallows flying high above. A small white dot caught my attention (a small star bright light) much higher than commercial airline flights seem to be and way higher than the swallows above. At first I thought nothing of it as it could be something reflecting light from the sun, but the object started to move to the left. After it moved it really caught my attention and a few seconds just stopped. After the obeject had stopped moving, two more lights (or star bright dots) appeared directly underneath the original object. It was in perfect vertical straight line underneath the original dot and totaled three lights. The three lights all proceeded to move left again and after a few seconds of following the dots/stars I tried to alert my wife and point out the general direction.  In this time more had appeared sporadically (in no formation or visibly noticeable) formation.  The number grew till around 7 stars could be seen and spaces all over the area of sky.  The whole event lasted around 2 minutes and my wife (to my frustartition) didn\u2019t managed to track or witness it.  I\u2019m actually sad that I alone witnessed it and would have even tried to contact a complete stranger to highlight what I was witnessing!  I would honestly love to know if any sighting (other than mine) happened and up till yesterday would have literally laughed at anyone telling me they had witnessed something extra ordinary or a UFO. This really changed for me yesterday and tried in all ways to rantionalize and explain what it could have been, both civilian and military wise. Hope to hear from you back and all the best.",

      "story": "Three fast moving violently churning out of place red and black clouds The date and time of this occurance is my best guess from memory. I knew what I had taken a close up photo of, but everyone I showed it to back then either laughed, or llooked at me like I was crazy. I put the photos away and for years they just sat in a box. Then I saw the movie Independence Day, and it reminded me of my photos. I had three, but I have lost one which I believe would have been proof positive, since it was traveling away from me and not towards me as they are in the two photos I have and want to send to you.  The location of the photo, was Fox Plaza on Hylan Blvd, near New Dorp Lane in Staten Island. I noticed off in the distance, three very strange looking clouds traveling in a V formation from northeast to southwest. If I were to guess their speed, I would have to say eighty (80) to one hundred (100) miles an hour. As they passed me they were almost directly over Hylan Blvd where the traffice was moving at 45 MPH. They were traveling at least twice as fast as the cars they passed over. As you can see in the photos, the direction from which they came had white and golden clouds, so these three very dark clouds were very out of place. What caught my eye was the violent churning of the clouds. The tops were black, whwile the bottom of each was flaming red. The bottom red part of the cloud was churning up into the middle of the cloud. To best describe it imagine a fuel explosion where a rising cloud of burning vapor is churning up and into itself. From the time I first saw it, and till it disappeared, the violent churning motion was clearly visible.  However, these three clouds never rose but did maintain a constant and steady speed, maintaining their formation.  These clouds did leave a trail which can be seen in the photos as puffy trails of smoke. They made no sound at all as they passed almost directly overhead. As I watched them I had this very erie feeling, and when they passed overhead at about a hundred and fifty feet, the hair on my arms stood up. I am sure that you can determine their speed since there are buildings in the photos. Please look at the puffs left behind, and the white clouds, and then at the UFOs, and how much they changed their shape in a matter of seconds. As I said, the inward churning of these clouds was very violent. I have never had any doubt since I took the photos of what they are. I only wish it were a motion picture camera I had that day so everything would have been recorded in real time instead of snapshots.

I was afraid maybe the gov't or someone would want to question me about it. But now a few yrs after, I want to tell my story. I was working on my computer one night then got a bit tired b/c it was getting late. I lied down, the bed was facing the windown and my toes were pointed right at the window which was about 4 ft away from me. Within secs of me lying down, my eyes were slightly open, I noticed a very bright fluorescent blue light that flashed for 2 secs. outside my window. I had off white curtains that covered most of the window. then right after that 3 small greyish figures flew into my bedroom, heads first one by one, then elongated and stood by my bedside. to on my side and one at teh end. They looked at that point about 5'6-6 ft tall, very slim, long skinny body, almost looks as if they were naked or wearing some sort of greyish suit that clinged tight to them. I couldnt tell if they were male or female, b/c they had no breast and didnt seem to have any male genitals either. They didnt appear to have any ears, a nose that only had the nostrals(little holes)showing, and very big almond shaped eyes and barely a mouth, just a slim line around the mouth area, which I'm assuming is their mouth. they didnt speak one word to me the entire time. I was so scared but I was motionless, I dont think I even tried to move. My first instinct was, okay i should assume they are evil, so i calmed down, but then the one closest to me reached their hand down at my chest area, I then pushed its hand away. i looked at one of the figures in front of me and it seemed scared that I was able to push the other's hand away. then they flew/floated out of my window heads first and were small again to fit through.  then there was the same fluresent blue light that flashed for 1 sec. then I got up from my bed and turned on my light. I was so terrified, i stayed up the entire night, and kept saying to myself, i can't believe that happened to me, This never happens in a well populated place like NYC. I was so scared that I didnt tell anyone until recently and since I didnt write down teh date or my experience anywhere out of fear, I dont recall teh exact time or date, but can only estimate. My encounter has stayed in my memories, that I could not erase. I dont think these beings are friendly though, and I dont think they are harmless either. if someone or something does something to you without your consent or without you knowing their intention, then they are violating us.

The object was stationary.At first I thought it was a satellite in a polar orbit. After maby five minutes two other objects came into view taking up a triangular formation. It was like light reflecting off a metal surface. The light was flickering and then the two other objects were in focus. The objects remained in a stationaty position. A few minutes following this two other objects also appeared to the east of the three objects. The position of the three objects was to the west of the airport and the other two to the east of the airport. Within fifteen minutes the first object left the formation and moved in a southern direction. The speed of the object was slow as if it was taking it's time with, the remaining objects holding their position. After whatching the moving object I looked back at the remaining objects and another object took up the position to form the triangle with the formation now smaller. Following this cloud cover moved in and I lost the oblects above the clouds. At the time of the sightings the sky was clear with unlimited visibility. So, the objects stood out against a clear blue sky. Thinking about it now it seems as if the objects were entering our atmosphere and appeared to be under intelligent control.

One evening, at the age of 4 (summer 1982), my Mom came to visit me at the babysitters' (near 106th and Park Ave, NY). She wanted to go to the store so the two of us walked about 2 blocks over to the local bodega. We were walking back and for some reason, I caught myself looking down at the ground. I remembered being told not to look down, and so I shifted my eyes to the horizon. It did occur to me to not only look at the horizon, but to check out the stars while I was at it. We were crossing the street, and I looked straight up as far as I could see. Suddenly, I tugged at my mother's hand and pulled her further into the street; \"Look, Look!\" I shouted as she pulled back on me. What I saw in that moment was a HUGE metal disk with bright lights all over it. It was suddenly hovering right over us. You could not see the sky it was so close. When she looked up, she yanked me back with the most chilling grasp, close to her waistline. I can still hear the desparate breath she took. Once I shouted look and was yanked back, I noticed everyone in the street stopped and was staring up at the sky. Once I looked back up again, it was gone, and everyone started walking again as if nothing had happened. The next day, when I went outside I heard nothing of the incident from adults. I knew of the news at the time, but was too young to understand what time it came on t.v.  Years had passed and I never forgot what happened, but as I aged I began to question if it was a dream. My mom and I had never discussed it after that night. I approached her one day and asked her if it was true we had seen a UFO. She sounded annoyed and said \"Yes!\" (she is not fond of such topics). I told her I did not beleive her, she was just trying to appease me, and asked her to recount her story. Here is what she said: \"I looked up and saw the UFO and lights, I was scared so I pulled you closer.\" I told her that when she pulled me closer, I looked around at everyone else looking up. I asked her what happened in that moment because when i looked back up the ufo was gone. \"The UFO ascended into the air, and sped off, like a bright white light, it just disappeared. It went up and out.\" ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

Directly across from my vision, in my two story house, hanging soundlessly and dead-center over the hip joint of my neighbor's roof, was a light tan, about 3 feet in height, water-tower (a round top with symmetrical legs) appearing object.  No lights, no sound, no movement.   As I looked, I called my mother in and she also said \"what the hell is that?\"  I had an 8 mm Kodak Brownie movie camera that I always used and ran for it.  No film.   My mother and I watched as this oject as it began to movie slowly, silently and perfectly straigt up about 30 fee and just hang there.  A couple of moments later, it started to move to the right about 30 feet also, stopped a few moments, and then go back to the center line over the house and down to the original position; waited only a few seconds this time and went straight up about 30 feet again and then to the left and slowly, slowly moved above all the 2 story houses on the block where it moved behind the trees and into the sunlight coming fromthe east.   I then lost sight of it.   I must stress that it was perfectly symmetrical and its movements were perfectly aligned with no wobbling, no lights and no sound.  It was absolutely suspended in mid-air.

I was at my apartment complex at Starrett City, located in Brooklyn, New York, on my way home to my apartment. The date was approximately summer 1998. The time was approximately 2pm. As I was walking to my building I glanced up at the sky for no particular reason other then to view the sky. That is when I saw the UFO.  What I saw was what looked like A torroidial  (Donut) shaped glowing plasma. The color of which I would closest describe as molten gold, but not exactly. The object was not a continuous torroidial  shape but was instead waning and waxing in the following manner. The object would start out as a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object and slowly morph into a complete torroidial shaped brightly glowing object. It would then revert from its torroidial shaped glowing golden like brilliance to a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object, again. It continued doing this continuously during the entire time I witnessed this object. I would estimate this object to be approximately 100 yards in diameter and 1 mile directly away from me. The direction of the object from me was approximately dead east. The object was traveling at a relatively slow but steady southern direction, AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF THE CLOUDS.  I would guess I witnessed the object for a total of 20 minutes. After looking at it for 5 minutes I decided to run up to my apartment to get my binoculars to see it closer. By the time I got the binoculars and made it back downstairs, approximately 10 minutes had passed. The object had traveled so far south by that time that by looking in my binoculars the object looked the same size as when I had first saw it. I witnessed the object through binoculars for an additional 5 minutes and then I simply left off looking at it. I would like to express my feelings as to what I feel I was seeing. Although I can not say for a certainty what this anomalous object was, what I can say, and I feel very strongly about this, is the following. This object gave me a very strong i! mpressio n that there was an engine of sorts powering it and that it was either malfunctioning or was experimental in nature and not functioning within expected parameters. Try and try as \"They\" might they could not get this \"Thing\" to stabilize at full power. Not unlike a cars engine that simply will not an maintain idle speed. Start it up, runs rough but idles for a while, and then stalls. I want to tell you that when this object was fully aglow as a complete torroidial shaped object its beauty was aw inspiring!!!

It was SW of where we were walking and it appeared to be huge. It was stunning and I immediately felt emotional looking at it. My friends looked at it after I yelled out. They were reluctant to talk about it then or afterward. There was a blurb on the 11:00 local news that night due to numerous calls about lights in the sky. They said they were told (by whom I'm not sure) that it was a formation of aircraft. The explanation didn't make sense then and it still doesn't. I'm hoping someone else out there saw it.

One of my friends had some girl cousins that came over for the summer.  We really didnt have many girls on my block so we decided to make the best of it and play a game called \"catch & kisses\".  On my block was a school CS 77 and we were all in the school yard chasing each other... well as I was being chased or chasing one of the girls from the small yard where your closed in (the school is a U shape and the small yard is in the U\") into the big yard were it's out in the open... I  saw what appeared to be a huge fire ball.  I remember a few of us kids stopped dead in our tracks.   I was coming out the small yard which was on the Manor Ave side of the school and I was Running into the big yard  which allowed you to look from Manor ave to Ward Ave.  I was facing Ward Ave which was west and saw the fire ball coming from that direction.  It appeared to fly right above us.  It seemed to be flying really low.  You could hear this fire ball.  It sounded.... well like what you would expect a fireball to sound like... i guess..... I've never heard anything like that before.   And you could almost feel this thing as it passed over us.  It flew right over us east bound,  but once it pass over it disappeared from our sights because of a 6 story building on the corner of 172nd St. and Manor ave. We all started running around tripping out and asking each other if we saw the same thing.  Oddly enough we really didnt make a big deal about it.... we all thought it was a meteor or comet.... and every couple of years it would be talked about as a weird unexplainable occurance. It wasnt until I got older that i started thinking UFO. This fire ball was or appeared to be flying really low... so low that a building only 6 stories block our view immediatly after it passed over us.  Also, this thing should have crashed.... exploded or somthing. there is no way somthing that was close enough to hear and feel.... like you feel when a plane is flying low..... didnt impact. and if it was a comet or somthing.... wouldnt the news report such a thing?  This is NYC!  Somthing like that doesn't go unreported!",

I was laying in bed on the 9th floor at 43rd and 10th facing north looking out the window at birds and planes.  I saw something moving very fast in the sky behind two buildings.   I watched the other side of the building to see the object emerge because I wasn't sure I'd seen anything.  I observed a dark dot moving in a straight line going north, north west at incredible speed, like a shooting star but without the trail or the light.   I saw other planes in the sky for reference and they looked like they were standing still compared to this object.  I was so startled that I jumped up and ran to the window and stared hard at the object moving throught the sky thinking it must be a fighter jet.  I am an airplane buff and can ID most things that fly but I had trouble even seeing anything and yet, there was something there.   My impression at the time was that I was seeing through the object and it was distorting the background of clouds behind it.  I could not see any distinguishing features.  I thought it might be a floaty in my eye, but it kept flying in a ruler straight line at preposterous speed.   I could not hear any roar of engines or a sonic boom, though I could hear helicopters that I could see so I know I was hearing the sounds from outside.   The object just flew out of sight at an altitude of about 3000 feet.  I base this on the angle at which I saw it and that it passed in front of the contrails of higher jets and the clouds.   I called my  girlfriend about an hour later and told her about the experience.   The reason I am reporting this so long after the event is because I just found my phone bill from that month and worked out when it had been.

I was at the top of the Empire State Building at around 11 pm with 3 other people standing on the side that faces Central Park but looking to go back to the side where the memorial lights were shining in the place of the World Trade Center when one of the people I was with said \u201cOh, Look up! It\u2019s a shooting star!\u201d  Realizing that when someone spots a shooting star it is usually too late if you don\u2019t happen to be looking in that direction, I was surprised when I followed where she was pointing and actually saw the \u201cstar\u201d. It was still traveling much faster than a plane, high in the sky, coming in from my left (from N-W) in a downward arc leaving a bit of a trail.  But what happened next really freaked us out.   The object then slowed down.  It stopped for a fraction of a second (as in hovering) and changed directions going back to the left for another fraction of a second then shot off to the right, made a very brief hesitation, then continued to the right (south-east)  and was gone\u2026no further sign of it.  In all, the Z like movement lasted about 3 seconds. I have never been a believer in UFO\u2019s but I\u2019ve changed my mind.  There I was with 3 other people and we all saw the same thing.  Then I checked out the internet and found that Channel 5 in Seattle had a news report on a similar sighting around sunset their time and that it was explained away by the FAA as a reflection on a plane.  No way \u2026it wasn\u2019t sunset for me!  Taking into consideration the 3 hour time difference, I\u2019d say if it were the same object, it took this \u201cshooting star\u201d about 1 hour to cross the USA from Seattle to NYC.   I want to be in contact with more people who saw this \u201cshooting star\u201d.  I know I\u2019m late in reporting this but I just finally had to say something.  It happened almost a year ago but I can\u2019t get it out of my mind. I want to be in contact with other people who may have seen this \u201cshooting star\u201d on Sept 11, 2006.",

Upon checking online for a good place to document my sighting, I noticed that another person this month saw something very similar out in California. I drew a picture when I got back upstairs. It's too large to fit on my scanner but I could make a reduced copy on a color copier and then scan it to send in to you guys as a follow-up. Never saw a \"UFO\" before.

Did not pay any attention to it, but began noticing more and more people stopping and looking at it, nudging their friends, asking questions like \"What is it?\"  So we looked again, and then stopped and stared like everyone else. What I had thought was just a blimp was actually a collection of lights or glowing orbs that seemed to be part of one thing - except no body was visible to the object.  It was silent, hovering in the sky just over the street, quite large - like a football field - but without any discernible structure.  It was simply a collection of lights or small glowing orbs.  This was very evident when the thing began slowly moving east, towards the East River, and was silhouetted against the full moon - still, there seemed to be nothing connecting the lights, no body, yet they did appear to be part of a large object. The things then disappeared behind a building on the east side of Manhattan. I will never forget it, and I wonder if anyone ever filed a report because many people saw it.  There was nothing in the paper the next day because the Central park jogger was attacked that night as well, so that was plastered all over the front pages.",

It stayed directly on path over my building, about 150 feet up. It was flat and round, I could see that because as it traveled it seemed to tip over, revealing how thin it was, then back to flat. Then upon passing by my building and a few more, it stopped and hovered, then turned a semi circle to the right. I freaked at this point because it was going against the wind.

I returned downstairs to my deck. Upon return I looked all around and over to the right about 2 blocks down the object was back paralleled with my building and moving east bound again.

I have a clear view of the Manhattan sky over the Hudson River. I noticed a very bright light directly over the Manhattan skyline.  It seemed brighter than a star and closer. A star (far away) was behind it. It was much tinier than the big light.  The light object did not move and remained in one spot, shining very brightly. I could not discern a shape, but it seemed oval like.  It stayed for a long time in the sky. When I checked back at 6.07am it was gone.  I wondered what it could be that would be static and shining so bright, and figure it might be a UFO or a very bright satellite,  but that didn't make sense since it seemed to hover in one place in the sky. I have a photo of the bright light. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))",

      "story": "A square shaped object approached the Verrazano Bridge from the north, turned left, and eventually disappeared. I was listening to the Mets vs Phillies ball game on the radio in my bedroom on 8/14/06. It was still the first inning. Pedro Martinez had hit a batter and forced a run in, the Phillies catcher was up. I believe the time was about 7:40 P.M. I went into the livingroom to close the blinds and I saw a square shaped object moving from north to south. I overlook the Verrazno Bridge supporting towers and the object was somewhat above the height of the supporting towers. The object was square in shape and moved at about the speed of a dirigible. Not seeing an airplane in the area, I went back to the bedroom and got my glasses. I thought that the object might be a box kite but I discounted that because of the height. Back in the living room I saw that the object was now closer to the bridge. It was grey with a black design of some sort along the top and bottom. When it reached the area of the tower closer to Staten Island the object turned to its right, to the west, and continued in that direction until I could no longer see it. When it turned I could see that it was narrow. I thought that it might be an advertising banner being pulled by a plane but, as I indicate above, there was no plane in the area. I then thought that it might be a weather balloon despite its shape but a balloon could not turn as it did. I estimate that I am about 1 1/2 miles from the Brooklyn side of the bridge and the object was another 1/2 mile to 1 mile beyond that. Unfortunately, I own neither a camera nor binoculars. The sky was still light as the sun did not set until about 7:55 PM.",

As we were heading towards the back of the home we both immediately saw a disk like object hoovering above my Grandmother's vegetable garden. It was so close that I went to pick up a rock to throw it but my Dad smacked the rock out of my hand.I was six years old at the time !  It was your classic disk shape, light grey in color, with multi-colored lights I think that were roatating in a clockwise fashion. It was hovering not more than 20 feet from us yet it did have some movement in trying to stay in place but ever so slightly. I don't recall any heat coming off the object. I did hear a buzzing sound. The dimensions weren't very large maybe big enough to fit 4 humans comfortably inside. At a certain point I recall a small panel on the inferior-anterior edge of the saucer slide open and some sort of camera like cone shaped obect come out and pointed it at us, almost like it was observing our actions.  My Dad said to stay put and keep an eye on it while he went into the house to telephone some friends.  Ater a few seconds of finding myself alone with this floating disk I got scared and ran into the house. When we came back out the disk was gone and I was very disappointed. I don't exactly know the exact time and Month when this occured but I born in 1964 and I was six at the time so the year was 1970. I remember wearing a t-shirt so it was either late summer or maybe during a warm spell in Fall. Over the years I would every now and again mention it to my Dad if what we saw was real and he said yes it was. I'm sorry to say that my Dad died last year but I today I have found your website and this is why I am writing to you in order to remind me that it was true what we saw that afternoon. My Father was a very successful M.D. and I too am a M.D. This  experience has stayed with me forever. I did do some research maybe a couple of years after I saw it but I never found anything. I guess at the time I was too young. We never mentioned it to anyone except to family and very close friends for fear of being considered crazy. Thank you very much for the opportunity in giving my eyewittness account that was much overdue ! With regards Frank C.",

      "story": "Small sphere in NYC I forgot about this until a few weeks ago when I saw a ufo-best evidence movie. I was walking north on 8th avenue in Manhattan.  It was about 44th st.  I was walking on the west side of the street. I was walking past a Japanese restaurant. I saw two people standing outside, smoking a cigarette (I assume they worked at the restaurant, but didn\u2019t ask), and looking up. What I saw (and this is from memory so it isn\u2019t great) is a dark grey/black ball, about the size of a basketball.  It was hovering over the building across the street.  The building was about 5-6 stories tall, so my guess is that the object was 70-80 feet above the street.  My first thought was that it was a black plastic bag that had been blown up by wind currents up the side of the building.  But I didn\u2019t see any of the loop type handles or an opening. My second thought was that it was a balloon.  I\u2019m still not sure that it wasn\u2019t that, but either a bag or a balloon would normally move in a thrusting jerky type motion, depending on the wind currents.  This didn\u2019t.  At some point after it was hovering, it moved at a slow, but steady pace across/over the street. It took maybe a minute for it to go over say 4-5 lanes of traffic. After that, I lost sight of it as it drifted above the building I was standing in front of. At the time it didn\u2019t seem like a typical UFO because I would think of those as more of a craft. This didn\u2019t seem like a craft at all because of its small size, but its smooth motion didn\u2019t seem like a balloon or bag either. I now carry a small camcorder with me in case I see something again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Bright  light over Sun Set Park, viewed from Park Slope on Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn   I would walk my dog around 11pm every night. This night I noticed a very bright streetlight in the distance. I thought to my self that the light was going to burn out in moment because it was too bright. But instead it started to rise straight up in the air. At a distance of several hundred feet in the air, the oval object turned from bright white to bluish / green color and then despaired in front of my eyes. Just before it despaired I noticed some detailed lines around the object.  Feeling that I saw something exstordinary, I went home and called Kenny Airport and asked them if they had anything unusual on the radar screens. They told me that they could not give that information out. So I told them I wanted to report a UFO.  They did give me a phone number in Washington, DC to call. The next day I called that number and a Commando answered the phone and told me there usually is no activity in the North East reported, and that most of the activity is in the South West. He made me feel like no one really cares, and my report will not make a difference. He took my number and told me he would check in to it. Well the Commando did call me back and told me that there where no reports made.  Years later, finding out about peoples abductions, I came to mind that the object that I witnessed the night was extremely low to the roof tops, which could of meant that I witnessed an abduction. Wanting closure for myself and maybe someone else who might need to hear my report, I decided to finally make my report.  I heard about your reporting center on a documentary \"UFOs Seeing is Believing.\" ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

In the 70's I had lived in a house in the St George section of Staten Island. It was a lovely old place, on a bluff overlooking New York Harbor. I moved from there in 1975 and the house, along with the rest of the block, was torn down in the late '70's. On my birthday in 1997 I went by myself on a sort of pilgrimage to the site. The block had been turned into a parking lot and by 1997 the lot was not even being used. It was mid afternoon, sunny, I was sitting on a log on the site just looking out over the harbor. I saw a commercial jet coming up the harbor to my right and to my left I caught sight of a flock of seagulls. AND right behind the seagulls was a metallic cylinder, I'd say about 10 feet long and maybe a foot round? ( I'm not sure how to describe the measurements). If I had to guess it was moving at about 100 MPH. The sun was gleaming off the metallic surface. It was moving in a straight line at a steady speed going from Bayonne towards Brooklyn. I just watched it, fascinated. It flew UNDER the commercial jet so it could not have been too high up. Commercial Jets going up the Hudson are in their final descent to LaGuardia, so the jet couldn't have been more than 3000 feet up? And this cylinder thing flew under it. I watched the cylinder continue a on a steady path until it disappeared in the distance as it was heading toward Coney Island. I saw what I think was a UFO 30 years earlier and hadn't seen anything else before this happened, or since for that matter. The thing looked so everyday, so matter of fact that at first I didn't realize it was anything unusual. I've told a few people about it over the years, but I've always wondered what did I see?...If anyone has seen this thing or knows what it is I'd love to find out... For whatever it's worth I just noticed the boxes the boxes about being contacted by an investigator. I have no problem with that, however I don't think I can add anything more than what I've just written. Thanks",

I got very confused and my friend asked me what is wrong.  I said I wasn't sure then looked up towards the South East and saw what looked like a rocket, plane or air craft.  It had a white belly with dark writing on it.  It was on fire and clouds or flames of green and pink smoke surrounded it.  As we watched others waking up and walking dogs also saw this object.  The object continued to streak across the sky until it exploded in what I would say was about seven pieces that started to descend and disappear.

One night whether it was a dream or what....I opened my eyes, and I was not in my room anymore...I was in some room that was so bright sort of like a soft neon white glow, which in that case I could not tell the depth of the room. It had no windows, or doors, and I was lying flat down on some kind of surface. I could not move, whether it was my finger or head...I tried to lift my head, but I felt as if my whole body was numb. At that moment a few beings just appeared, from what door iI dont know, they were already in position, next to each other, but standing a little away from where I was lying. There was this one being that I guess walked up to me, and started to lean over me and looked at my face, what he was looking at, or for I don't know...I was so horrified., but I could not move...He was grayish beige, with huge long eye's that sort of went slant..after a few moments of looking at me, my body started to go down, and this tunnel like fashion was around me and I saw the alien face descend further away, still looking down at me...Then I woke in my bed still horrified......what was this?

      "story": "Bright light appears over NYC I was sitting in the car with my girlfriend outside of her house at approximately 5:00 a.m. early Sunday morning. As I was staring out the windshield into the sky I noticed an  unusually bright light in the sky. The object looked like a star but appeared to be in the sky at or about the same level a plane would be. The object did not appear to be moving, so I immediately ruled out that it was a plane and it was also much to high to be a helicopter. After staring at it for a few minutes I noticed that the object actually had moved slightly in the sky and was no longer in the spot it was just a few minutes ago. The light appeared to be about 5 times in diameter bigger than the north star. When I zoomed in on it with a camera, I noticed that the object actually was not bright white but it was actually blinking other colors of light. Red, green, blue and yellow lights were blinking one at a time. But when you looked at it with the naked eye it appeared to be just bright yellow or white. After driving around for a short while I tried to figure out exactly where in the sky the object was. I estimated that it was somewhere between Brooklyn and Manhattan as I was staring at it from the eastern shores of Staten Island. Staring at it with the naked eye, the object looked like a white flair that was not moving in the sky. Just a very bright and close twinkling white star, but as I said when you zoomed in on it, it appeared to be blinking different colors. When my girlfriend attempted to take pictures of it, it would not appear on camera. For a split second we were able to zoom on it very well and see that it was actually a circular object. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I am wondering if any other people saw this object because it was in the sky for about 2 hours. If I were an alien, I would probably visit NYC at that time because every is sleeping or drunk. I went to sleep and when I woke up the next day the object was obviously gone.

Me and my friend were watching a movie in my room.  My friend went to the window to have a cigarette and noticed a blackish object in the sky. He said it was very still when he first saw it but when I came over to look at it it moved very fast to my left. By the time I got my phone out to take a picture it had already moved half way across my window. It paused for a second a couple of times and seemed to drop down and then come back up into sight almost right away. It was shaped kind of like a triangle and was a dark metallic color. It didn't reflect the sun or glow or anything. The date was 2007, June 30 around 6:30 PM. I think we were pretty close to it but I couldn't hear any sounds like I'd expect a plane to make. I'm not sure how fast it was moving I'd guess that it was definitely faster than any airplane I ever saw. I apologizer for the low quality of the photographs. The only camera we had was my cell phone and it was moving too fast for me to catch it in the frame. After I took these pictures, it disappeared behind the red building you see in the left corner of the pictures so I couldn't get another shot.",

Today I saw a new entry (occurrence 3/25/2006, reported 4/2/2006, shape circle lights, duration 2 minutes)from someone in Almherst NY which describes exactly the same thing I witnessed.  My posting information is as follows: Occurrence date:  5/6/1996 - Reported date  6/18/2005 - shape:  lights - Duration:  2 hours.  I saw these lights, exactly the way described by this person.  The lights followed me all the way to Exit 63 on L.I. Expressway.  At one point they lost me somewhere around Deer Park and they followed a wrong car similar to my car.  I proceeded to exit 63 and then when I came back to get on LIE, I saw them again, waiting for me.  They again followed me all the way to exit 41 N. Oysterbay.  At that point I pulled to service road and stopped.  They stopped toO.  We (me, my husband & 3 children) hangout there for about 15 minutes, they stayed too.  Then I took Rt. 106 going up north.  they came north with me for about couple of miles until the sky ran out of clouds and there is where they stopped.  They waited a while and when the distance became too far (but I still could see them in the sky), then they went back to LIE and proceeded going toward City.  The strange part is that when I saw the lights the first time I was coming from city on LIE, it was around Elmherst area near those gas tanks and they saw me too and started following me.  If you want to read my full report, go by posted date or occurenace date, I am not sure, and look for category light.  Until today, I have been trying to explain this logically to myself(earthwise logically that is) and I could not come up with any answers.  I don't think the lights were coming from any solid objects such a flying spaceship or else, but I believe we are being scanned by other beings in the universe.  They may not be able to come here for distance's sake but they can send their intelligent lights to monitor us and they can control their lights from where ever they are.  It freaks me out to say this but I think they can see us too otherwise how could they find me again.  One thing is for sure,  WE ARE NOT ALONE.",

One sphere was stationary, one was moving in a steady circle, and the third was moving diagonally across the sky. The woman stated that she had been watching them as she walked up the street for a couple of blocks. She said she had seen 20 or more at once and they were disappearing up into the sky. The three I saw seemed to fade up into the sky as well. A few minutes later 2 more appeared and moved across the sky at a steady rate in tandem, before stopping and remaining stationary.

This object appeared at times to glisten in the sun, but would emit a bright light that would change in color from white to red, that gave the appearance of a spot light. At this time, I notice a North bound airliner which had generated four contrails south of the object in question. When the distance between the AC and the object closed several miles the object changed this tract to a southern direction, and appeared to pass the AC on the port side and pass through the contrails.  The object(spot light) would continually change in color from a bright white to red, but the object still reflected the sun. The Aircraft continued on its path, but I would think that they must have observed it also due to its proximity to the AC. I lost tract of the object shortly after it passed through the contrail. The object did not generate any observable contrail which I also found unusual. I have checked Heavens-Above for possible irridum flares, sattilites for that time and found none.",

However I will leave this report in case anyone else in Brooklyn or Northern New Jersey saw something similar early may or late april and have been wondering about it. At around 3 am I saw towards the SW at around 30degree above flat ground a very large stationary moon like object. It was not the moon, and much larger. This was through my living room window. I gawked at this sight for a few seconds, moved a few feet left and right to see if the object was a reflection off my window, It did'nt move. I am certain that this object was real and outside my window.  It was the size of a large Grapefruit held a couple of feet away from my face. I turned to get my Binoculars from a closet for 5 second and then when I reentered my living room it was gone--vanished. The most likely explanation was that someone was shining a huge searchlight towards a new building that was located in same direction  1 1/2 blocks away. This flat concrete surface most likely would light up in a circle to resemble this \" faux moon\". However in examining this sight in daylight I had the impression that the \"faux moon\" was higher on the horizon, but perhaps I misjudged this. Also I find it strange that someone would be shining a huge search light which would have needed to cover the surface of old fashion outdoor movie screen at a new building at 3am in the morning. There was no police acitivity like helicopters in the area at the time, nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. But this is New York and strange human things do occur.

      "story": "Brilliant white orbs, similiar to stars, in the sky over Queens, New York. This sighting happened at 2:30 in the afternoon in a brilliant blue sky.  I was walking along Queens blvd.  and noticed a man walking towards me and staring directly upward toward the sky.  This seemed odd to me because the man was transfixed on what he was looking at.  Ofcourse this peeked my interest, so I looked at what he was staring at too.  At first I did not see what he was looking at, but then the object caught my eye.  There was not a cloud in the sky. Im not sure if it was supposed to be a full moon that night, but the moon , atleast 80% full was out at 2:30 in the afternoon.  I just so happened to be wearing sunglasses.  If I hadn't had them on I wouldn't have been able to see this oval shaped ufo.  It was a brilliant white \"orb\" about as high in the sky as a visible planet or north star. Both of which I thought this to be.  Just as I was about to continue my walk and right this off as a star, it moved.  It moved left to right a very short distance.  I couldn't have been a plane.  It couldn't have been a helicoper. It couldn't have been a balloon.  I stood there and tried to convince myself that this was something that I could explain easily.  And then from the Northwest came from nowhere, three more.  Directly north of the first object came two more.  In total there were six.  All the same size color, shape and brightness.  Now I was freaked.  What the hell was I looking at?  It was such a bright, sunny day that I could't get anyone else to stop and witness what I was looking at.   The man that originally was the reason I stopped in the first place had gone.  The objects that came from the northwest moved slowly towards the first object almost forming a triangle formation.  The two from the north were just slowly downward almost as if they were on strings.  Almost as quickly as they appeared, five of them vanished upward as if pulled straight up on strings.  The original orb never left the sky.  I stood there for about 45 mins and then headed home.  When all six orbs were in ! the sky at the same time, they reminded me of what skydivers falling together to make a formation might look like.  The only problem is that these objects never fell to earth as skydivers must eventually do.   So there you have it, my first ufo sighting.  Its official.  I am the most skeptical person I know.  Im one of those \"see it to believe it\" people.  Now i've seen it.",

I dismissed it as a plane, but suddenly realized it was circular. It was moving slowly, and crossed the sky a little bit. It appeared to move down but then went upward. Then it disappeared up. I live near LaGuardia Airport, and have for a long time. I can tell the difference between a plane and anything else. At the angle in which the object rose, it was opposite the airports, also including JFK. It rose too sharply to be a plane. I am unsure if the object was a UFO or a balloon. Right after I saw it, I went to my computer. I checked to see where balloons pop. It said they pop at 30,000 feet. http://www.balloonhq.com/faq/howpop.html was my reference website. That seemed too low for where my object was flying. The object also seemed far away, so far that I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to it if it was a balloon, due to its sizing.",

The premises are outdoors and are guarded by guard and dogs in strategic positioning.While outside and on top of the small roof overlooking the night and starry sky. I distinctly recall the perfect night and how the stars were out. Then as i positioned to my left and towards lower manhattan side i noticed what seemed to be a shooting star. It was bright and streaking with a blue red into the atmosphere. I was amazed first as i thought it a rare chance to see a shooting star. But as i expected it to fizzle out. It only went distant and stopped seemingly pulsating. I was thinking this is odd. Then the pulsing had in a flash moved east as if by a enormous speed and in a  seeming instant. I was now really getting a bit curious and also uncertain what i was expecting. Then i noticed another pulsing closer and i was now sure this was more than odd. Within a flash i looked up and there directly by some amazing unexplained way i was seeing this enormous craft that was very sophisticated and truly unimaginable. The outer side was running a thousand patterns of seemingly colored lights in some sort of sequence. Yet somehow i looked towards the center directly above me and saw movement as if something was being done within the opening as it seemed to turn. But i didn't know what it was doing.Yet i also knew that if i could see this craft here in a borough of ny city then this may have a cloaking ability or some type of force to disguise or hide itself if necessary for its own advantages.I knew that in a instant just by its presence. That i was just nervous and almost wishing for what happened when it just ascended into the upper heights directly above then did the zipping movement into the distance where i saw a pulsation again and then it zipped out. This i almost never share due to its circumstance and the nature of our being on earth. But i feel this event had shown me there are real di! mensions to other realms of being and a extreme degree of sophistication and who knows what else around . Moreso who knows what was in that craft as i don't think i want to be too sure.Even writing this gives me the butterflies.This is a true event as i experienced.

We looked out and there was this weird looking \"thing\"  didn't really have a shape, it looked like a long line and had three lights on it.  A red light, a green light and a bluish/white light.  It zipped behind a tree and kind of just hovered there, then a round white light came off it and flew back and forth between the trees and it kept flashing, almost like it was taking pictures.  After it flew back and forth, it then went up and down and then returned to the bigger ship (for lack of better words).  Then the big ship slowing flew out of the tree and flew into the next tree and once again just sort of hovered while the white light flew out again and did the same pattern.  Then it flew to the third tree and once again the same thing happened.  I couldn't focus on the big \"ship\" because it was covered by the tree, but I could still see the flashing lights.  The little one that flew back and forth looked like a perfectly round ball of light.  Then after the third trip,  It hovered in the third tree for a bit and then the street lights that were around that tree got very dim, and this ship kind of took off really fast - went across the sky - not up or anything.  And once it drove away, the street lights came back on.",

His sighting appear to be the same as mines being that they saw 3 object heading east with two crafts flying together while the 3rd was a bit apart (in my case 2 ships apart and trailing 10 seconds behind. What I would like to know is if the crafts that Vancouver saw was traveling horizontal to earth or at an angle as most pitures and drawings that we see of triangle crafts. Because I originaly reported it as a cigar shape but what if what I saw was a side profile of the triangle, like seeing the rim of a book.  ****  note **** The skies were still blue at 19:30 about 1/2 hour away from sunset.  Vancouver, WA to Brooklyn, NY is 3000 miles apart. WA reported it at 13:55 (PDT) that's 15:55 (EST). I made my report at 19:30 (EST).  If it is possible that we seen the same 3 craft then it must have travled at the speed of 1000 MPH to reach my area in 3 hours +.  When the object came in from the horizon at 260 deg SW flew at the closest point over my house I ran from the back yard to the front ( 60' ) just to see it come out from over my house and head NE at 80 deg toward Long Island.  As I stated in a previous post, after the sightings, I veiwed a commericial jet plane ( close enough where you know it's a plane but can't tell what airline and about the same size as the crafts) flew over the same path at about the same speed it took the crafts to reach and pass over my house.  So if a plane cruises about the speed of 500 MPH and the craft travels at 1000 MPh and they both took about the same time to cross over my house then is it possible that that crafts were twice the size of a jumbo and were flying twice as high giving the illusion that it was the sze of a jumbo and needed to travel more distace then a plane to cross over my home.",

I work as a a real estate development consultant. I have a masters degree in urban plannning and development. I reside in the Bronx, New York all my life but I travel often. On this afternoon I drove my car to pick up my older brother who was at my mothers house. As I was waiting in front of the building facing a westerly direction I was looking up in the sky before me. It was a beautiful bright sunny day and there were only a few clouds in the sky. As I looked upward I noticed a round object floating high up in the sky. It was far above the the highest planes because where I live Laguardia airport is right over the East River and many planes are taking off and landing. Planes that are just flying through must stay way up there about 30,000 feet. This object must have been as high as 60,000 feet. As I looked at it it appeared as if it had just stopped moving upward. I stared at it. It was light bluish, silverish, whiteish in color. It was two colored in that hew. It seemed to be fading into the background sky. And within a minute it faded away from view. Later that night a friend from the neighborhood told me that he was calling me on the cell phone because he had also spotted it that afternoon. He said it was movuing upward and them stopped. He has seen UFO's twice before.  Go figure. I believe in them myself. It was amazing to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

The light was a bit bigger than a star, thus the abnormality in its apparent speed, if it were an airplane. The light also seemed very bright and consolidated,  with very faint flashing lights.  At first I thought it was some kind of orbiting satellite, but that seems unlikely due to its visibility.  I live near 2 major airports, JFK and La-Guardia, and see all kinds of aircraft flying overhead at all times of the day.  This was different.  A plane flying at its height would be fainter, the blinking would be more articulated, and it would be considerably slower.  Also, there were other planes in the area, which made it easy to compare.  After walking towards my apartment for a minute I turned around and it appeared not to be moving, and seemed to pulsate. Another craft, flying considerably closer than the first one, flew in from the west.  It had 4 lights rapidly blinking in an L shaped pattern: 3 of the lights making up the rod of the L were white, while the tip of the L was red.

I was on 23rd and 6th ave in new york city.  I watched it float for about ten seconds until i lost it behind a building.  There was no chemtrail activity for a week, but then today there was a ton.  And today I had my camera.  I was taking pictures pretty much all day from my apartment living room.  The first out of the ordinary thing I saw was a black plane, flying right to left, along the path of an already laid chemtrail.  This trail then became twisted like a dna strand.  I then moved and went into my bedroom and sat on the window sill with my computer.  About 5 or ten minutes later I saw a bright light hovering in the middle of the 'X' of two trails.  I had to run to my living room to get my camera and then pointed it at the light asap.  I don't know what happened, but my camera didn't pick up the light, but it did get the plane \"appearing\" out of nothing.  I think it was \"cloaked\" because there are very faint geometric distortions, like in the predator movies.  Frame by frame the object moves very oddly.  The camera is shaky becasue i was trying to step out onto the fire escape.  Once i was out the object had already started flying to my right, so i ran inside to my living to get another angle.  I got a few seconds of it. Next sighting was the same sort of thing, but this time the light was MUCH more intense.  I say on camera that it looks like a flashlight.  I couldn't figure out if it was star or not.  It was soo bright though and it looked like it had an aura around it.  And it didn't flicker at all. My camera had trouble focusing on it and at times and it look very much like a disc shaped ufo when it lost focus. It hovered there for about 30 minutes, but it slowly drifted lower and to the right and finally behind a building so i couldnt see it anymore. I had almost decided that it was jsut a star until this same bright light emerged from behind the building and started over my head to the right. It wasnt traveling very fast and it had no blinking lights at all. in fact it was just one light. I could make out all the airplanes, and in fact one flies right by the orb light and you can clearly tell the difference. When it was going over my head it took on sort of a bird like shape but still was just a light... this one didn't turn into an airplane like the fisrt one did. I live on Orchard and Stanton streets in New York City. My living room faces north and my bedroom to the west. Jamie Maussan talks about these and the exact same thing can be found on orbwars.com.",

      "story": "Alien working in a store in a busy neigborhood blending in with us. In the summr of 1989 I had been on my new job for about a year.  I'm in to health food products, and a co-worker told me that there was one near my place of employment. She said that she believed it was a small store.  At 5:00 P.M., I left my job and started looking for the store. I figured that it would be nice to be able to purchase items like vitamins, etc. on my lunch hour. By the time you get off from work and travel to these little stores, they're closed.  I walked down the street slowly, looking on both sides of the avenue, trying to find the store.  Eventually, I came upon a small store that I figured had a good chance of being it.  The building above it was abrownstone that was boarded up.  I steped down the one or two steps and opened the door to the shop.  Almost as soon as I walked in, I had a feeling that this wasn't the best place.  There was a man there.  He was my height 5\"6\", skinny, dark, but otherwise normal.  I have a very clear, loud voice, and because of my previous vocal instructions over time, somewhat loud.  I asked the man, whether he had whatever the herbal remedy was that I wanted.  He became very angry and said in a voice that was almost as loud as mine\"you got some nerve coming in here with all that attitude.\"  I immediately answered him with \"what the hell are you talking about atitude.  Without saying another word, He aimed his finger at my heart and something that I coiuldn't see hit me in the heart.  I have ben know for having a lot ot courage so me being me, I just stood there and stirred at him. Then he said, \"I could have just killed you.\" I then realized that I was in more danger than I realized. I also knew what I had accidentally come upon.  There was a conversation that followed where I sought of asked where he was from, but he only said that it was a long way from here.There was great emphysis on long. Every time he moved around the store, you never saw him move to another location, he just appeared at that spot. Some how, I was asleep and while still standing, I felt my feet being kind of numb.  I had been standing in that same spot for a couple of hours. When I finally got up the nerve to say that I was leaving, he said\" we are leaving tomorrow to. That would have been Wednesday. I walked to the door, and as I looked around he said, \"when you get home tonight I want you to say xxxxxxx.  I didn't say it then and I won't say it now.  As far as I am concerned, that could have been some password the he could have used to take me aboard his space ship.  As I placed my hans on the door, his face blurred and changed to what he really looked like.  He was still my height, very dark, but his eyes were large but that skin around the eyes reminded me of a crocodile.  Ther was a thin yellow line running from one corner of the eye to the other. And he laughed out loud. He surely wasn't pretty. I really wanted to ask more questions, but thought better of it.  On Thursday, the day after he said they were leaving, I walked down to that store, near the curb.  I wanted to see if there was anybody there.  Would you believe, the place looked as though no one had ever been there.   It was empty.  I rode past on the bus ther other day, and the place had been undergoing renovations. It's now a nice looking brownstone with a store.  I'd like to know who rented it before.  The things that I saw him do, couldn't have been done by anyone other than an alien.  I'm now actually glad that I had the experience.  It told me what I suspected all along, that we are living with these people and cannot tell the difference. When I saw how he just changed his appearance within one or two seconds, I was surprized, to say the least.  This really happened in 1989.  I was sought of afraid to mention it because I didn't know whether or not I should.  Don't know who you're speaking to these days.

I woke up at 4:00 AM to get a glass of water when I saw, what I thought was a really bright star out my window.  When I went to lie down, I kept thinking how peculiar it was for the star to be so bright.  I went back to my window and with my glasses and notice that the light looked like it was pulsing.  It would be bright, and then it would not.  So mulling it over I thought, this is really a UFO so I grabbed my camera and zoomed in.  My camera is a Sony Cybershot so picture quality is not as good of professional photographer quality.  When I zoomed into what I thought was a start, I realized I was gazing at a circular ball of light with the colors of fire (red, blue, yellow).  I took note that this light had a pattern which was, after a few minutes, easy to follow.  At the end of the red, blue, and yellow the light expanded.  When I took the picture I would get a disk in the photo, it looks like a disk of energy.  The light would move far away, then it would come back.  I think it had to be several miles away in the sky.  When I started to look around there were 5 others but not as bright, my camera could not even zoom in that far.  I actually when back to bed around 6:30 AM when the light was far away enough that I new it was leaving.  I am 30 yrs old, hispanic, educated with a bachelors in business, I work a full time job, and very credible. This is my 3rd time seeing strange light in the sky, but the first time I got a picture and could verify that it was not just a star. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))",

      "date": "2007-03-08T00:00:00",
      "story": "Photos Taken in New York on a Bright Day of Oval Craft Near Statue of Liberty I am writing to send along a pair of photos which I think you will find interesting.   My mother-in-law, a very successful and down to earth woman was on vacation with her mother in New York in early 2006, and as part of their trip they were taking the tour to the Statue of Liberty. Before boarding the boat to cross the harbor, they were standing on the shoreline, taking in the sights. My mother-in-law is an amateur photographer with a very nice camera (I\u2019m not sure what kind off-hand unfortunately, only that it is a very expensive camera, and has been used many times for family functions and such, so I know that the quality of photos it takes is extremely high, and the camera is in perfect working order). While she was taking photos of the harbor and the island across the way, she captured a metallic object hovering just above the water. Her goal was to take a photo of the statue from the shoreline and then take another photo of where they stood on the shore from the island once they crossed (she was playing with the idea of mirroring her position for fun). Once on the island, she took another set of photos, facing the spot they had stood before. In both photos the object can be seen clearly. It was a bright, almost entirely clear day, sometime in the early afternoon and the object was in nearly the same position as before. It appears to have hovered in place for at least the length of the crossing, and if you examine the photos you can tell that it is the same object. Oddly enough, this appears to be a chance UFO because she states that neither she nor anyone else saw anything the entire time (I don\u2019t know exactly how long the ferry ride is, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s at least twenty minutes or so including the time between photos) In fact, as she was showing us pictures, she started to skip past these as \u201csilly\u201d because she was having fun with the camera, and never noticed anything unusual about them until I bolted upright in my chair and asked her to let me have them. Once I pointed out the object, she said that she thought they were buoys (which she still thinks) My mother-in-law is not very receptive to things outside the norm (like I said, she\u2019s very grounded), so I think she is dismissing these photos for that reason. However, I have enlarged these photos many times, as far as I could without pixelating them all-together, and the object is not in any way connected to the water, much less floating in it. It is clearly metallic, and vaguely oval in shape, and as I said, it either stayed in place unnoticed for the length of the ferry ride, or reappeared, which seems less likely to me (but that is speculative). There seems to be an off-yellow/reddish \"aura\" or sheen around the object as well when the photo is enlarged. There doesn\u2019t appear to be a large disturbance in the water around it, and there are definitely not any disturbances or ripples like those that would show up if it were floating in the water, with the water splashing against it; further indicating that it is just above the surface. Also, if you look at the photos, you can get a sense of scale against the images in the background. I\u2019m not an expert, so I don\u2019t want to hazard a guess, but if you look at the object as one point in a vector, or triangulate, it seems to be fairly small, but certainly not as small as a balloon or anything like that, and again, it remained in place far too long to be debris. As I mentioned the camera is in perfect order, and by the photos you can tell that this is not an imperfection in the lens or anything. Anyhow, those are some of my own observations using limited resources.  I am sending scans of the original photos along for your inspection. The first photo is much clearer, and easier to distinguish details in, but the second provides an interesting view of the object against the city in the background, and if you look you can see the dock where they took the first picture off-center to the right for perspective. These are completely untouched, and uncropped. I would be very interested in knowing your opinion of these pictures. Speaking for myself, as someone who has studied the UFO question for over twenty years, I am convinced that this is some sort of UFO, but I\u2019m curious about it because it is very small, and it\u2019s odd for it to be there for so long in the first place, much less without being noticed on such a clear day. It does look somewhat like other objects I\u2019ve seen captured on film, but those have usually seemed larger. Anyhow, if you have another explanation, please let me know.

A few of my friends and I were walking home from a party about 3 blocks away from my house. We were goofing around and having fun as we walked home. at around 11:40 I looked up at the sky and looked at an object that I had thought was the moon and I thought to myself \"Hmm... The moon is awfully small tonight\" and laughed to myself. So we got to the corner of my block and walked down the hill to my house when I looked up again and I noticed the \"moon\" was kind of following us. I asked my friend to look up and she said the same exact thing I was thinking \"Wow the moon looks awfully small doesnt it?\". It was emitting this sort of yellowish glow, and was really eluminated. I thought I was going crazy, and it really creeped me out. My other friends then looked up as well and were like \"what the hell is that thing in the sky?\" and about 12 seconds after they said that it sped away through the night sky, and as soon as it dissappeared it started to rain. I dont know what that thing was or if it was even the reason for it to start raining but I know it creeped me out, I searched google to see if I could find any sphere shaped objects in the sky and it lead me to UFO'S so I searched UFO's and found this site and thought it was worthy to report my case. This is really uncommon in such an  urban place (or so i thought), I never seen or heard anything like this happening over here, and especially in the Bronx. I thought things like this happened in kentucky or tenessee to backwoods insest-ial cousin families, but when I saw this sphere, this thing move across the sky it creeped me out so much I'm afraid to even set foot outside my door. My mother thinks I've gone crazy and the other friends I was with during this night have gone into denial, with the exception of my one friend who is pretty creeped out as well. I keep looking over my shoulder to see if anything is there, that is how creeped out I am about this. I would leave my information for you guys to contact me but my mother will probably try to admit me into a psychiatric hospital or something along that line. I dont know what you guys do or investigate or whatever but I just thought I'd put in my small report. Thank you for your time I guess and good luck . . .

The birds and all the animals (including my dog and cat ) started going hay wire and then the 3 circles formed a triangle above my home.   I then ran inside to get my camera and wake up my husband who was sleeping.  And even when he saw them he was speechless.  So at that moment I started snapping some pictures..

We were going over the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan and about half way over the bridge we saw a flash in the sky at about the 2 o'clock position in the sky facing east. The closest thing I can think of describing this is a flash of lightning. It was almost like a flash from a camera comming from the middle of the night sky. There were no clouds in te sky, there was no rain or thunder and was'nt hot enough for heat lightning, being that it was alost Thanksgiving. We both saw this and we were both taken back by this. This did'nt happen again on the drive back to Staten Island that night. We kept looking up in the sky to see if we can see it again. The part of the sky we saw this flash in was not obstucted by apartment buildings or any other structures. This was a clear view off the bridge facing south east. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE)) Hi. My name is ((name deleted)).

It happened very fast, and it was even luminous against the very bright bridge lights. It was unmistakable. No one in the area semeed to have seen it, so I forgot about it. That was until I saw that others in NY had seen it too. I think it may have been shooting towards Fort Wadsworth, where there has been UFO sightings before. I feel that whole area under Fort Wadsworth is hollow, going back to the 1700's; and DoD, Army, Coast Guard etc all have bases there. I think these orbs are energy fields, enabling these crafts to cheat normal physics. I wanted others to know what they saw was real.",

Sunday, July 2nd, 2006 around 6:30 - 7:00 pm a storm was coming in, i went to go close my window and i glanced in the sky a few hundred feet over the building across the street and seen what i thought was a hot air balloon and thinking what are they nuts!?!? flying a balloon in Brooklyn? in a storm? then i got a better look as it flowed towards me and realized, holy $h#* what is that?!?!it was triangular in shape, but reminded me of a stingray fish. very aero dynamic, it was porcelain white in color very shiny, had a bright orange glowing border, and a metallic sphere orb attached at the center bottom of the craft. turned on it side slowly hovering back and forth carefully. all of a sudden a bolt of lightning came sideways from a cloud and hit the metallic sphere. in an instant it made a air burst sound, completely turned bright red orange, then gone. at first i thought it exploded so i kinda jumped back. but it just like magic, disappeared. i freaked out because i always imagined if i did see one, it would be at night, all the way up in the sky flying around with lights. never would i have expected it to be this way. i mean broad daylight, just above the buildings. and i seen it if it were the size of a baseball! right in front of my eyes! everyone should have seen it, it was very large and right there!! i can't sleep. i can't stop thinking about it. i can't stop going to the window out of curiosity. i was afraid to tell anyone for the reason of people thinking im on drugs, or am just crazy! that's what i would have thought! thank god my girlfriend heard the sound. later on around 10:00 pm i went to the store, i look up in the same area, and see a white orb floating very slow and straight towards the gowanas. i said this can't be! i shook my head and convinced myself it was a bird or something. then i look again and see a black orb leading 2 more white orbs in a triangle formation and said i must be going crazy!. i walk fast toward the pizza store and the guy asked \"you ok?\" i said no but if told you i would just be a nut so forget it. the guy said i tell you something people think im crazy that last week i saw a ufo in bensonhurst. i almost had a break down and got this feeling of being in like the twilight zone or dreaming. this cant be happening i said. i told him that is exactly why i am freaking out. so he tells me to tell his friends at work the story i just explained and they all look real scared. they say word for word it was the same story except for the lightning  hitting it. and for a week they were all abusing him about it. so we basically felt a huge sigh of relief. says that his brother seen it as well but did not hear the noise he heard which was strange and could tell that confused him the most. so i go home bugging out and just see and search google not expecting anything to come up, but to my surprise i was not the only one. very similar stories and descriptions all over. my gut tells me it is dimensional. like beings from other dimensions or something. i mean the way it just flashed gone!! like a light switch. the craft honestly was beautiful! perfect! floated like a balloon. like it weighed nothing. i think it was searching for the lightning to give it that charge boost or refueling. it was just moving in a way that it seemed to like get the right spot. like fine tuning a radio station. or harpooning a fish. what i saw was surreal. i mean right there!! in front of me and my eyes! in real time! wow i can't stop picturing it! it all happened in like not even 1 minute which seemed like 10 min. i was speechless and in shock at the moment. lost for words. and was shaking like a leaf. never would i think i would be one of those people who had a story like this to tell. now i am one of the so called crazy ones. all i have is my sketch of the craft and in my view is a very good one. i know i will always be lookin in the sky from now on. its not the question anymore if they really exist, but what does earth, or the 3rd dimension do they seek or need.  and is the goverment involved? because now i do reserch and see that there are hundreds of sightings per year!! and we deny them. are they here to help, or destroy? too many questions i now have and definitly wont be sleeping tonight! wow is all i keep saying. for the records i got this impression, or feeling that they or it knew i saw this. for what ever reason. hands down the most shocking thing i ever seen. this exp. made me a skywatcher.",

      "story": "Lengthy observation of low flying, large spacecraft hovering just above Throggs Neck Bridge: September, 1964 I am now a retired attorney, and have been married for 40 years with 2 grown children.  I have held several significant positions since my retirement.  I say this knowing that my pedigree may mean nothing to my credibility once this story has been told. While returning from upstate NY, and heading south along the parkway, we saw a large, lighted object in the distance, hovering over the Throggs Neck Bridge.  We all thought it was a blimp. As we got onto the bridge the object, remaining stationery, was clearly visible as a flying saucer.  It was above the center of the bridge with a span that was much greater than the width of the bridge. Around its center were white lights, revolving in a counter clockwise manner. The ship was silent.  All passengers in EVERY other car, were looking at the craft, even the drivers!  It was amazing that no one caused an accident that night.  We were also motioning to one another to confirm that they saw what we saw, and they did. Then as we were just under the ship, it went from hovering over the bridge to gliding along a path that followed the parkway to the Northern State (I believe) and turned east and followed the lighted road out to Suffolk County where it turned south and flew along the path of the Oyster Bay Expressway and out of sight.  It was as if it was intrigued by the traffic and the lights of the cars and the roadways it was above.  Until it sped off towards the southern portion of Long Island, it was cruising at speeds comparable to our cars' speeds. Then it darted off so fast as to become a blip in a matter of seconds. There were times while we followed it that it darted up and down and east and west but did not deviate from the overall path I described above. As soon as we arrived home we called up the Suffolk County A/F base and Newsday.  Neither confirmed any other contact by others or that they had tracked anything on any Radar. My brother and our 3 other passengers all spoke about what we had witnessed and, to this day, 45 years later, we still know that what we saw was a huge saucer shaped object, capable of unbelievable maneuvering and great speeds.  We are convinced it was other worldly. Were there other accounts in the area during the time I described (actually it was the first weekend of the month of September '64 and we were bringing a friend up to Albany State College to begin college.

      "story": "I was on phone with my sister and looked out kitchen window to view pond in yard. Towards the north I spotted at first what I described to my sister as a plane on fire but one I exited house an viewed it from yard it looked more like a cone/triangle shaped object that shifted forms somewhat as I viewed it. It was sometimes more triangle shaped than cone but the light on bottom remained what looked like a sphere of fire. After about 30 seconds I got off phone and told my sister to call my mom and tell her to look outside. I then called up my neighbor and talked to him for the duration of event. Unfortunatly he was not home at the time but wanted to listen to my descriptions. I was honestly so amazed and scarred at what I was seeing I was glad to have his presense over the phone. I watched the 1st object for 2-3mins move slowly eastwards and hover before it slowly moved upwards and northeast gradually going over horizon. I rememeber telling my neighbor it was ! gone but I couldn't stop watching sky. My skygazing was rewarded about 30-45 seconds later when another similiar object appeared. This one hovered in sky near the location where 1st one did for about 1 minute before moving north and upwards thru the clouds. My feelings during this event were that I was seeing something I wasn't supposed to be seeing. A ufo here? How come theres not hundreds of other people able to see this. I left event deluding myself into writing it off as a flare and maybe it was. I'm no expert in non commercial aircraft. Lately I'm feeling that I was lucky to see it. Glad to share.",

I watched the bridge for another hour to see if I would see it again, but nothing happened.

IT DIDNT MOVE. IT WAS LARGE ABOUT A FOOTBALL FIELD LONG. IT HAD A TOP AND LOWER BOTTOM. THEN IT STARTED TO WOBBLE.THE TOP WENT CLOCKWISE, AS THE BOTTOM SPUN COUNTERCLOCKWISE, FASTER AND FASTER. THERE WERE MANY SMALL WINDOWS AROUND THE BOTTOM HALF. AND LIGHTS UNDERNEATH WERE GREEN, RED,YELLOW BLINKING. THERE WERE NO WRITINGS ON IT. fIRST IT WOBBLED ,SPUN FASTER AND THEN IT TOOK OFF SO FAST MY EYES COYULD NOT FOLLOW IT. IT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR. THEN IT APPREARED IN ANOTHER PART OF THE SKY, AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED. IT DID THE SAME THING AND APPEARED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SKY UNTIL IT WAS GONE. I FORGOT TO MENTION AS IT STARTED UP IN THE MOTIONLESS SKY THE WINDOWS SPINNING ,AND I FELT AS IF THEY WERE WATCHING ME. THERE WERE NO FUZZY LIGHTS ETC. THE OBJECT WAS CLEAR AND I SAW IT LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW IT WAS REAL WITH MANY EYEWITNESSES. I WAS BORN 1953 AND I STILL REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS. I AM 55 YEARS OLD NOW AND REPORTING THIS.THERE IS NO EARTHLY TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN DUPLICATE THE SPEED THIS UFO WENT.HOW COULD IT HANG IN THE SKY WITHOUT FALLING? MY FATHER WAS IN SPECIAL FORCES.

MY FATHER WAS GOING TO TELL ME AL! IENS ARE REAL AND THAT THE USA GOVT IS HIDING EVIDENCE, AND BORROWING ALIEN TECHNOLOGY. HE ALSO SAID A BLUE LIGHT IN THE 1960'S WENT UP IN THE SKY AND THAT IS WHEN I SAW THE UFO, JUST AROUND THAT TIME. I AM WRITING A BOOK ABOUT THIS. I AM TRYING TO FIND SOME EYEWITNESSES. BUT ALL HAVE GROWN UP, MOVED, DIED. I REMEMBER SOME NAMES. I HAVENT LOCATED THEM YET. i AM STILL LOOKING. i BELIEVE IN ALIENS, SHIP, ALIEN TECHNOLOGY, BECAUSE MY FATHER WOULD NOT LIE TO ME. I SAW A UFO AND I KNOW ITS REAL.I CANNOT PROVE IT. BUT IF I HAD THOSE PICS I WOULD HAVE GONE ON TV AND EXPOSED THE TRUTHS.

      "story": "5-6 Star like lights moved single file across the sky 10/20/1973 This was a long time ago but here it is. Myself and a friend were watching the 6th game of the world series. 10/20/1973 (Oakland A's vs Mets) It was about midnight if I remember correctly. The game was over and my friend left to go home.  I minute later he knocked on my door and told me to come outside he wanted to show me something.  We want out and he pointed to the sky.  I looked up and there were 5 or 6 objects moving across the sky very slowly. There was no way to calculate the distance but they looked like stars except they were moving slowly in single file across the sky.  We didn't really think UFO at the time, we just kind of wondered what they were. We said goodnight and went home. The next day at work (we both worked at the same company) I picked up the NY Daily News the read about the game.  There on the back page taking up half the page was an article with numerous reports of UFO's, from the US to Russia. I believe the Russians were reported as sending up jets to intercept. Another was the Governor of I think Ohio reporting a UFO flying over the roof of his car as he and his wife were driving down a highway.  If I was to see the same thing today I would probably think they were satellites and maybe they were.  But I found it very unusual that a major publication would have a story so prominently displayed on it's back cover the day after we witnessed this event. I don't really believe in people from other worlds visiting us, only in the possibility.    My friend still feels that they came to watch the game.  I decided to post this after reading the last post of a sighting on the same day as mine. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "Bright White High Speed Light over Newark New Jersey/New York Harbor/Staten Island Area I witnessed an event in the early part of 1993. I was in Manhattan, NYC, but the UFO(Light) flew over NJ and NY.  It was winter and around late February. I don\u2019t have the exact date, although I called Newark Airport and also left a message at a UFO Reporting 1-800 number, when it happened, and I don\u2019t know if this was NUFORC, but I haven\u2019t seen a similar event on your site. I\u2019ve decided to send my account just for the record although it\u2019s 15.5 years later. I witnessed this from my then 31st story window on West42nd at 10th Ave. Manhattan looking SSW down the Hudson River past what was the World Trade Center.  It was in the early morning hours at about 5AM. I was awake early studying for an exam. The morning light was just beginning to break (pre-sunrise) and the sky was overcast with a very high, thin layer of clouds. Visibility was good as I could see a few planes taking off and landing in the distance (11 miles) at Newark airport as per usual. Although the planes were like dots in the distance I could see their flashing lights and was very used to observing the speed and altitude, at which they flew, which by the way, appears to be very slow and very low from the 42nd St. vantage point. As I was gazing out of the window I noticed a very bright white dash of light moving above the higher thin layer of clouds. It was shining through from above the clouds and came from the West near the area of the NJ/NY Statue of Liberty Harbor. It may have been further south at Newark airport, but was difficult to gauge at that high altitude.  Based on the distance and how quickly it traversed the sky from WEST to EAST (in about 1.5-2 seconds), I estimate it was traveling at the speed of about 10+ miles per second, as it shot EAST across the sky from Jersey, over Staten Island towards the Verrazano Bridge/Atlantic Ocean (an air distance of about 15+ miles) and disappeared out of my range of view. It\u2019s also difficult to accurately estimate the length of this light sliver, because I was far away and I only saw a light and not an object. I\u2019ve taken into account the possibility of window reflections, but since I saw the slight fluctuations in the shape of the light from behind the clouds, as it traveled above and across the thin cloud cover, I\u2019ve eliminated that possibility. I am an artist and do pay close attention to these details. Also there were no light beams or spotlights visible from the ground below either, and as it was still somewhat dark, I think I would have noticed. I saw something out of the ordinary and unidentifiable, at least to my knowledge.  This was definitely not a commercial aircraft above the clouds as it was going way too fast and the light it emitted was so much brighter than anything I\u2019ve ever seen from that distance. Anyway this is my report, given in as much detail as I can recall.  Thanks for the opportunity to share my experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

One would pull ahead and then fall back. It did this a few time until both were again side by side and continued in a southerly direction. There altitude was apx. 1000 ft. and they were apx. 30 ft. in diameter. My second sighting was in late afternoon while on my roof. Due to the earlier sighting I brought my binoculars. I was looking NNE when the same two ojects came into my field of vison. I put down the binoculars to get a better look since they were moving much faster then the first sighting, also they looked to be at apx. 1500 to 2000 ft. They slowly went into a westerly curve and were gone in seconds. These objects were not birds, weather ballons or any other objects I have seen in the sky during my lifetime.

I was watching a movie, when a strong noise, like that of a helicopter, appeared all of a sudden over my building (very close to Washington Square)  I went out to the balcony and saw a big object standing still, flying very close to the last floor (the 17th, I live in the 3rd)  Actualy I would have said it was a helicopter, but my mind was saying to me \"no, it isn't\", as there was a wierd light belt surrounding the structure from the bottom to the top, with white, blue and red colors.  I went downstairs to follow the object, as it was disappearing to my eyes whenever it crossed to the other side of the building or was geting closer to the roof.  As you can imagine, I wouldn't have gone downstairs a regular monday at 4AM for something that wasn't wierd enough.  I have to add also that, as a sciencetist I use to be kind of objective and sceptic.  I took my camera (regular old digital camera) with me, but the only one picture I could make was a very vague light in a dark sky, which equals nothing.  The object finally slowly flew towards the west side, I tried to follow it, but disapeared between the buildings. I went from 3rd street/Laguardia Place  all the way to the 7th avenue, and from there I could just slightly hear the \"helicopter\" noise, but couldn't see anything else. I want to imagine that it was a helicopter that, because was dark and the long shaped structure, I was confusing with something else, and that's all. But could you please let me know if you have been reported from anyone else or you can find anything like this today?

Three minutes passed  and I was walking across the kitchen when I see a flat disk.   I first thought it was a plane but it was staying still floating in the air planes cant stay still they have to move forward so I went to my window and saw it was flat. I instantly thought thought it was a U.F.O (Unidentified Flying Object) , and I was shocked because I always wanted to see one.  Suddenly its lights start flickering and the lights streamed across going from red to green to purple white blue and all sorts of colors.  I was so amazed the first thing that came to my mind was camera.  I went to my room to get a camera and I came back and started to take pictures but there was a tree blocking it and it was fairly 500 yards away.   I then try to zoom in and move around the tree but when I got a good shot my  camera screen turned blue like some sort of static water picture. I tried to take pictures but all it would take is blue images. I then called my friend to see if he can see it.  But then it just  starts to faint away and becomes invisible but when a minute passes it comes back brighter again streaming with colors.  I then heard police sirens because someone had called the police.  It kept disappearing and appearing again and again like about three times for about half a hour then it disappears and doesn\u2019t appear back.",

I put the binoculars down to look at it with my eyes and it flashed (Like a camera flash) and it was gone.  It was a bright sunny day with blue skies and some puffy clouds.

It must have been at a low height because an aeroplane that appeared at the same time was flying at a much geater height. the aeroplane disappeared quickly. the ufo was still moving slowly behind some trees in our neighbourhood (green drive, roslyn, nassau county, ny) and took about two minutes to reappear from behind them. it then dipped downwards and then it became clear that its shape was actually round with a bulging centre as if two shallow bowls had been joined together rim to rim. in a minute or so it disappeared. we did not hear any sound throughout this time.

The color was a mat black and I could not tell if it had any windows. It seemed to be about 100 feet above the tallest of the buildings on that block which is about 20 stories. The weather was clear and it was easy to see a great distance. Since it was moving so slow I really tried to see if there were props like a helicopter and there was nothing. I pointed it out to two people and they said it looked bizarre, they could not tell what it was either. They walked away not seeming too interested in fact, no one seemed to care about it or  notice it. It continued over the buildings and out over the Hudson River and then just slowly ascended upwards. Before it was over the Hudson I watched it's level in relation to the buildings and as far as I could tell it was moving in a straight line until it was out over the river.

Once we got on the bridge, my passenger and I had a clear view of the object.    It appeared to be a few thousand feet in the air, located in the bay between Bayonne and Elizabeth, NJ.  The triangular pattern of its three blinking red lights made me suspicious that it may be a jet liner heading for Newark Airport, but it looked nothing like the many other planes in the sky and was not on the normal approach pattern to the airport.   The object, when first viewed, appeared to be saucer shaped, with a raised flat top.  As we moved further along the bridge, the craft appeared to elongate into a cylindrical shape, however it seemed that the orientation of the craft to my car changed so I assume I was just getting a different view of the craft.   The craft, in addition to the lights, had a strange whitish blue hue to it that illuminated its body and made it stand out against the night sky.  It appeared to be moving slowly eastbound, but it is hard to say if it was really moving at all.   We lost sight of the craft soon after we exited the bridge.",

I was recording all the fireworks with my video camera, that's when I looked up at the sky and I saw 5 glowing lights moving very slow.  When I started recording the objects for some reason my camera stoped working.  They were flying in a pattern.  They were very, very bright. The objects were changing colors.  One time they were yellow and then turned blue all of the objects at the same time.   I had never seen anyhing so bright before.  All of a sudden they broke the pattern and started moving at a very high speed then they disapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report from Excelsior, MN, for the same date.  PD))",

      "story": "Strange lights during storm in staten island I currently live on staten island and have an apartment along the water with a view of brooklyn on my left and the verrazanno bridge front and center and some of the rest of the island on my right. On march 13th the weather was extremely horrible and it seemed as if staten island was in the middle of a hurricane. Heavy objects were being tossed about by the strong winds and it was very dangerous to be traveling as almost all traffic lights were malfunctioning due to the weather. It was about six o'clock in the evening as i started to cook when i heard a great noise out on my balcony.  I walked over and saw my heavy metal and glass furniture being lifted and tossed about like newspaper but i looked over toward my right and saw bright flashes of lights almost like fire over toward a heavily wooded area.  My first thought was a fire must have started over there but the way the bright lights were lighting up only that part of the sky seemed weird to me.  It seemed as if something on the ground over in that direction was projecting a light towards the sky in a cone shape not a natural shape as if it was a fire. Yet the lights kinda flickered like a fire with orange, pink, white and yellow colors.  This lasted for about fifteen minutes. I was stuck in place and suddenly i saw a round object shoot directly up from the spot that the lights were coming from into what seemed like clouds or fog.  At that same moment all the lights sort of sucked into the sky where the object disappeared and then total darkness as if no light were ever over there.  Seconds later a bright blue/green light flashed in the area of the sky where the object and the lights disappeared and the blue/green color lingered for a few seconds and sort of drifted off into the clouds or fog.  I was still standing there trying to understand what i saw or was seeing when about ten minutes later a flash of lightning came pretty close to my apartment and kinda woke me up out of my trance of thinking and made me look up and the same blue/green! color w as now right above me in the sky and in a flash disappeared.  Ive been checking the internet ever since and have yet to find anyone who saw anything from that stormy saturday night.

The noise is what woke us up it sounded like an earthquake and a jet,the house shook, I thought that perhaps my central air condition unit was on the blink, so I went outside to check. This was what I saw.  A large oval object in the dark sky,  almost like a standard blimp but much bigger and had no bottom basket as on a blimp. Color silver grey, metalic. Red lights on right and left side of object, and beams on white lights very powerful from the middle of object.  The white beams of lights were flashing. The flashing lights like those of pictures being taken, flashed in my face and I got scared and went inside and got my husband.  I purposly woke him up because otherwise if I told him what a saw at night he would think that I'm flipping out or something.  My husband looked at it and we both decided to go inside the house.  We could not sleep for the rest of the night.   I was very nervous, I told my co-workers about what we saw,! and they were surprised that I did not take pictures, or call 311.  I guess I should off but I was so nervous at what I was looking at that I froze.   I'm sure someone else must of seen it.  My neighbors assume that perhaps they were making a movie and this was a movie event in the sky.  People are afraid to talk about this event.  Movie makers inform  in advance that a movie will be shot at what time and ask to move all cars. There was no such request,and movies would not make such noise at that time of night.   We watched from the house until it hovered away in what seemed an eternety.  No smoke, no exhaust, just noise and out.    I say it was a UFO.",

The majority of the lights were white but a few were red. The lights were very clear and visible on the objects. I stated to my son that he should look out of the back window of the car and see the lights but at then at that moment I noticed that there was more than one of the objects. Two of the objects were very close together maybe about 100 to 200 ft. and the other three were further away in distance. I keep telling my son to get out the car and look that I was not trying to be funny; he stated that he saw the object earlier and that he thought because it was in the sky that it had to be a blimp. I stated that a blimp is not that bright and that blimps does not hover like that! the light were very clear I could not put a shape to the object but it definitely was not that of a of a blimp. I don't believe that I have every encountered (UFO) the shape before. By the time my son got out the car to look only one of the objects was remaining. We watched the object until my son got across the street visible. I had attempted to take a picture but was unable to because the phone I picked up did not have a media card in it.  I went back to the window shortly after to see if I could see the object again but the objects had disappeared. There was a plane or are craft in the air at the time of the sighting. You could tell the difference because of the movement that the plane had I know a plane when I see one.  I am reporting this because the object was an UFO not to make jokes what you do with the information is up to you. On August 27, 2001 I called (911) and reported the information to my police department that the airplanes were flying very low after obser! ving for a couple of weeks on my own, they informed me that it! was a b limp on Sept 11, 2001 the world trade center went down. I later found out that the direction of the plane was that of the World Trade Center. I still get chills to this day.  I don't know what the objects were but that why it is called UFOs I could not identify the sighting. The feeling that I got from the UFO was soothing and the movement was that of something in observation.",

I soon noticed a very bright star, there weren't any others noticable in the sky.  It was abnormally bright, and it was moving north in the sky.  It felt much too distant to be a plane, and there was no sound.  I asked my friend what he thought of it. He said he wasn't sure, he thought it was probably a satellite and fell asleep.   I've never seen a satellite before, but this 'star' looking object then stopped and stayed in one place, making small seeming motions back and for or up and down.  This object would fade in and out sometimes, other times it would get covered by clouds and it made it difficult for me to understand what it really was. After observing this one object, and noticing others over a matter of a half hour to 45 minut! es, one single, low flying plane, flew through the sky right in the vicinity that I was watching the object. I felt as though someone else saw this and was investigating the situation.  This was the only airplane I saw in the sky from my location that night.  Not long after that, I saw the most facinating thing I have ever seen.   A reddish, hazy, round sphere, less than a quarter of the moon in size came from nowhere from the lower left side of the star moving to the right, and flew at a very fast speed in front of the clouds across below the star looking object, and immediately moved south, in front of the clouds, but still feeling pretty far away.  The experience lasted about ten seconds and then it disappeared.  My friend soon woke up, and we left. I can't really remember much after the red sphere, I know the sky cleared of clouds, and some stars were visible.  It became more difficult to tell what were stars and if the star like object was sitting among them. I was pretty ove! rwhelmed.",

      "story": "VIDEO of orb in Brooklyn, NY 4/26/09 On Sunday 4/26/09 at approximately 5pm, I was videotaping the sky over Brooklyn, NY (Windsor Terrace neighborhood) during and after \"contrail\" or \"chemtrail\" airplane activity. It is critical to note that my curiosity into \"chemtrails\" is somewhat irrelevant here and does NOT represent the conclusions of the NUFORC.  Apart from the observed airplane activity, a genuine UFO sighting occurred and was videotaped, and that is the purpose of this report and video submission.  The NUFORC has made it very clear to me that it views the notion of \"chemtrails\" as a complete hoax.  I fully accept that view, but am determined to report the UFO sighting anyway. In the wake of the airplane activity (whatever its nature), I shot a 26 second clip of the sky, about 14 seconds of which depict what appears to be an orb-like shiny object.  It becomes visible at about 8 seconds into the video and shines or reflects light to varying degrees until the video ends at 26 seconds. MY BACKGROUND:  WITH UFO'S:  My prior UFO sighting reported on this site occurred on 2/6/97 in Mesa, Arizona.  On that occasion I had a spectacular, close-up, detailed sighting of a triangular craft.  A follow up report gave added detail (map) of the location. OTHER:  I am a former advertising executive turned high school teacher and coach.  I hold degrees in education, marketing and political science. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be sincere and serious-minded.  We disagreed with him regarding the issue of \"chemtrails.\"   We have looked at the video he provided, and we cannot determine what the object is, photographed through thin cloud layer.  However, we have no reason, at this time, to conclude that the object was a genuine UFO.  PD))",

      "story": "Small UFO sighting at Yankee Stadium in daylight. I was at the Yankee game yesterday (Yankees vs. Rangers).  I was sitting in the second row of section 420c (upper deck) with a friend.  I took my eye off the batter to look up at an overhead plane, and on the way, I noticed a small object only about 30 feet away over the field. The item was charcoal gray, probably metallic, and in the shape of a toaster.  It was only about one foot in size.  It spun around in circles, but always remained parallel to the ground, and had something similar to a reflector light on a bicycle in the upper right corner, which shined like a dimmed light.  It also had a small amount of haze over it. The item must have came in over the third base side of the stadium, I saw it when it was directly in front of me, and continued its path over the first base side of the stadium, accelerating after leaving the stadium, until out of view. When I first looked at it, I thought it was a garbage bag, floating in the wind, but then realized it couldn\u2019t because a garbage bag would roll over rather than remain parallel.  It couldn\u2019t have been a balloon, because it was not going in the exact same direction in the wind, nor was it rising at a fast pace or going straight up. I did not bother taking a picture of it, because when I saw it, I thought nothing of it, and when I realized this could be something else, it was too small and too far away to get a good shot with my cell phone camera.  However, my friend who I was at the game with saw it, and as many as 1,000 other people sitting in the vicinity could have potentially seen it.",

There were planes over head as well and it looked nothing like them or anything I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

We were looking at the Manhattan skyline right across the river (approx. 38th street) just North of Empire State Building.  The night sky was completely empty of clouds, but I noticed what originally looked like a cloud moving North to South across the NYC skyline. It looked to be only a few hundred feet over the tops of the highest buildings.  It was moving with more speed than I have seen a cloud move but slower than the speed I usually see helicopters move at over the city.  There was very little if any wind. Although it had a greyish/white cloud-like look, it was formed in a somewhat distinct shape...close to what the hokey UFO saucers are depicted as.  I watched as it crossed behind the highest building in my direct line of sight and it seemed to either dissolve or head away from me (toward the EAST) rather than continue along! the same North to South route it had been on.  The entire sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "3 lights form hovering triangle and disappear behind NYC skyline Around 11 pm on Monday, October 25th, a friend and I received an email tip stating that mysterious lights were hovering above the Queensboro bridge in New York City.  Having a great view of the bridge from the roof of the building we were in, we went upstairs to watch. We first saw one bright orb-shaped light floating in the sky fairly low, maybe 100-200 feet above the skyline. It was not moving, so we weren't sure if it was actually floating or a light on top of a building.  As we watched, we started to notice small, bizarre reflections in the sky around it, tiny points of shimmering light (more like reflections of light then actual light itself) slowly moving around the sky, becoming more and less visible. Once, one of these reflection points hovered slowly before shooting off at an extreme velocity straight into the sky. After seeing this, we we're frightened and excited, and ran to get a video camera to film the events that followed. The video of the following events can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQzn0zFG6fk (note that youtube compression makes this much less dramatic, please contact me personally if you desire a higher resolution version of the video)  After we set the camera pointing at the still brightly glowing, low, non-moving light in the sky, we noticed that directly above the light two smaller lights came on, both moving fluidly but unnaturally above the initial light. They seemed to have emerged from the initial light. At first these were smaller, and they appeared approximating an upside-down triangle with the initial light at the base. All three then became equal in brightness for about half a minute. The two upper lights slowly switched positions, as the light at the bottom (which had been on for considerably longer) began to descend, very slowly. It descended completely below the skyline over the course of about 3 minutes, with the upper lights moving to approximate a vertical line. Then, the upper lights, each now as bright as the next, began to also descend, until all three had disappeared behind the skyline. The witnesses are two college graduates who live and work as artists in Brooklyn, NY.",

I was standing facing north by northwest, minimal cloud cover (cumulous clouds). I was watching a plane (737 most likely) traveling west in the sky may have taken off from La Guardia or JFK airport and was making its accent but everything was smooth and the plane was approaching cloud level.  I was noticing the speed the plane appeared to be traveling and the direction as well as the cloud the plane was approaching. From overhead, about the same altitude of the cloud was a ball of fire but no trails as it traveled, just a ball of fire about 4 times the size of the plane, traveling about 5-6 times the speed of the plane.  The ball appeared to be metallic and made no sound.  This ball entered into the cloud about 1 mile ahead of the plane and did not come out the other side.  The plane entered the same cloud and passed through as if nothing happened.  I was amazed at what I had seen because I\u2019ve never seen anything like that but what was truly the greatest part of the experience was when I looked over my left shoulder someone else had been watching the same thing and was shocked also by what they had seen.

There was a dark oval dome near the front, on top, but it was black and stood out because it was a bit shinier, like glass.

      "story": "formation of lights seen overhead At 7:15 pm last night, I walked out of my office building at 55th Street and Broadway in Manhattan.  I\u2019m an amateur astronomer and I often look up at the sky, and I did so as I left my building. Almost directly overhead I saw perhaps 6 to 8 hazy and indistinct lights\u2014 that\u2019s the only way I can describe them. The lights were in a roughly cruciform shape, but just roughly.  The lights at the \u201cends\u201d of the longer axis would brighten occasionally, then dim again, but in all instances the two end lights were brighter than the other lights of the shape. The color of the lights was a grayish white, never varying. The shape was, as I say, almost directly at my zenith, somewhat to the west of an imaginary line drawn between Castor and Pollux at the north end and Betelgeuse at the south. I was confused, because I knew the sky was supposed to be clear lasnight (I\u2019d just checked it on the New York Clear Sky Chart, http://cleardarksky.com//c/NYCNYkey.html, as I often do). And indeed I saw numerous stars in the sky, including just around the light formation, so the sky did seem to be clear. I looked away, to see if anyone was near to verify what I was seeing, but (surprisingly) no one was. When I looked back, the lights were still there. When I looked away again perhaps 30 seconds later, then back, they had disappeared entirely. A few minutes later I noticed two of the lights once more, for perhaps 30 seconds, then they again faded; they had seemed to move slightly to the west in the time since my initial observation. The only thing I can think that could cause this display would be a set of narrow-beamed lights pointing straight up and reflecting off a cloud layer I could not see. However, if there were any clouds there, they did not cover any of the stars in my field of view. I have to say, though, that it did not \"feel\" like lights reflecting off clouds, to my eyes. It looked more like bright lights shining through a cloud, but as stated there was no cloud layer visible. The only logical explanation is lights reflecting off clouds that I could not see, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what it was. Even so, I probably would not have submitted this sighting but for something odd that happened a few years ago and that this event reminded me of. At that time, perhaps five years ago, I was behind my apartment building and I had again looked up; as I recall it was late evening twilight. I saw, again overhead, four bright lights in a square or diamond formation. These were pinpoint sources, and looked like bright stars. As I watched, over the course of perhaps a minute, the lights faded, in unison, and disappeared. I know this may make me sound odd, as if I have a habit of \"seeing things.\"  I do not. As an armchair astronomer, I take an active interest in the sky and tend to look at it often.  Thus I\u2019m not surprised that I should have seen these things, which probably have prosaic explanations, but which for the life of me I can\u2019t figure out. I\u2019m a rationalist, a skeptic, and I have to admit I can\u2019t explain these events.",

It looked slow fluctuations or as jelly fish moves \u2013 I don\u2019t insist that these moves were real \u2013 they may be explained by thermal airflows or small moves of binocular in hands. I was not able to identify this object to any known flying object, so I think it was UFO. The only person who witnessed the event was my brother.  Around 6:50 the object stayed at the same spot , but became smaller, it looked like a regular star, though closer to 7am the sky was light, and no stars could be visible. Through binocular I still could see object structure with less details. At 7:05am the object was covered by clouds. Unfortunately I did not have camera or camcorder with high resolution that would allow to show object structure, so I did not make any pictures.",

      "story": "Strangely moving orange lights appeared briefly over the East Side of Manhattan. I was driving south on 2nd Avenue in Manhattan from 128th Street, when a strange flickering orange light appeared in the southern sky, heading eastbound.  Flickering like the flame of a candle or a star, not like a plane's lights.  My only guess at the time would have been a blimp, but a blimp unlike any I've ever seen.  Also, it was more spherical than blimp-like. Soon other identical lights came into view, passing from behind tall buildings on the west side of 2nd Avenue.  I pulled onto the next street I could, 119th Street, and immediately hopped out and started filming on my cell phone.  Total I would say there were 7 lights that were in the sky, but I was only able to capture 4 on my phone.  Three seemed to fly together in a pyramid formation before the 4th came flying into view.  They didn't fly in consistent patterns either, sometimes changing directions distinctly.  At the end of this experience, which lasted about 4 or 5 minutes, each light seemed to climb higher into the clouds until they were no longer visible. If they were balloons, they were definitely producing light and massive in size.  I didn't see any smoke trails or quick, random movements to make me think they were flairs.  The flight patterns, while they did change directions, didn't alter in velocity, from my point of view. I am 25 years old, from Northeast New Jersey, and have lived my entire life in and around the New York City area.  I have never seen anything even remotely similar to this, and I am always looking at the night sky.

      "story": "My husband and I didn't believe in UFO's until we actually saw one! It was a warm summer evening, around 7:30 P.M.  My husband was home and my babies were in their cribs sleeping.   I went to the bathroom window to remove my clothes off the clothesline.  I had to stand on the edge of the tub to take in my clothes, and in the far off skyline, I noticed a very large orange sun which meant it was going to be very hot the next day.   I stopped what I was doing and looked at the sky, and  admired it.  Often in the daytime, when hanging out my clothes, when it was clear out, I could actually see the top of the Empire State Bldg.   Anyway, as I looked at the skyline, I noticed blinking lights, and the object was zig zagging coming closer and closer.  It was quite far away, so it was small, and the closer it got, the more curious I became.   I went into the hallway of our apartment building and went up to the roof.  As I watched the object get closer and closer, I called out to my husband and he came up to the roof.  As the object came closer, we could see it was silver and it looked like there were lights of different colors going round and round, like the top of a police vehicles light.   I ran down and got my neighbor and she came up and we looked up in the sky.  As the object approached us, it kind of tilted and it then looked like a round shaped disk, and the sound it emitted was a swishing sound.   It cam around and went to the left of  us, and it stopped.  When it stopped, the swishing sound stopped and their was a humming sound like a motor.  I noticed windows in the center of the object, and what we thought were different colored panes, was instead, there was some sort of lights changing colors and it was rotating inside of the craft.   We noticed then two rods, on each end of the craft.  They were facing downwards.  We looked up mesmerized and we asked each other if we could figure out what it was, and we were just dumfounded.   After what seemed like 10 or 15 mins. the rods disappeared and the object which had become an oval shape took off zig zagging and wit! hin seconds it disappeared from sight.  When the object took off, the motor stopped and there was a swishing sound.  We were dumbfounded.   We went down to our apartment, my neighbor who didn't speak English, but Italian, I spoke with her as that is my language and she said she never saw anything like it.   My husband went into one room and I in another and we both drew what we saw.  We drew the identical thing.   We decided to call the Civil Aironautics Bureau, and they kept me on the phone about an hour asking me questions.  They asked me not to call the newspapers or the radio media.  We didn't call anyone else nor did we tell anyone else.   The very next day, we looked in the newspaper to see if there was any article of what we saw the evening before and there was none.   We we eventually moved away to upstate N.Y.  This was in 1963.  After living there awhile, one evening we watched T.V. and saw a program which showed a couple who claimed to be abducted on board a UFO, and they had been hypnotised and they described the object.   We could hardly believe our eyes when we saw the same object we had seen that evening in the Bronx.  We then knew we had seen something that was from outer space, a UFO.   From then on, I know in my heart that there are space vehicles of other planets.  I no longer feel those who  report UFO sightings that they are imagining or not being truthful.   Thank God my husband had been home that evening and saw what I did, for it he wasn't there, he wouldn't have believed me.   This is the truth, and even though it was a very long time ago, it is something I will never forget.   One more thing, when the object took off, it went into the direction of Orchard Beach.

I'm a Superintendant of a Residentual Building across the street from the Bronx Supreme Court and one block away from the Yankee Stadium.   My two nephiews and I were walked up to the roof to watch the amount of Yankee fans that came for the Old Timers Game.  Sure enough, as I last stated here back in July of (I think it was 1999), we witnessed them again, the first one appeared to us like fire directly above our heads it just spun around in a circular motion then just disappeared.  The second seemed like a star but it was too high up to say anything about it and was moving very rappidly also not in a steady motion. The third was astonishing. It was amazing but we were not surprised due to the fact we saw them before plenty of times just spending time up on roof-tops. It was close to the Supreme Court's roof just hovering straight across in a very slow-motion. It was an oval egg-shaped like object, about the size of a full-sized van and an orange or fire like color to it with no shine or light, just creeping across the sky. What got us was that about 3 minutes to the direction it headed towards there appeared to be a crime scene.  All of a sudden a Police helicopter flying in circles around the area and about 20 Police cars. Then we saw a fourth heading towards the same direction but this one appeared to be white.   A fifth was coming behind him, this was to the left of us while the other to the right of us.  This one startled us a little because it was very close, seemed to be coming towards us at head level then it rose up at about 50 feet above our heads, this one was very clear to us.  It was definatley oval, saucer like, with two blue lights going around in circles on the top center of it.  The lights were not bright at all, perhaps they weren't lights.  It then changed shape, seemed like two legs came out the backside of it then it crumbled like liquid metal and again back to it's solid shape and headed to the same direction as the other four. Five minutes had past and the sixth appeared behind us this time above the Yankee Stadium heading straight towards our direction also at head level and slowly towards the last fives' direction.  Then about two minutes later, five in a V shaped formation headed straight across the sky for about ten seconds and just vanished before our eyes, again towards the same direction as the last six before them. I stopped wrighting to the National Ufo Reporting Center because I wasn't getting any answers.  I was going through a lot of great disturbing confusion and wanted to point the finger at all the wrong places.   Instead I decided to ask, what ever I was looking at, for answers.  This is all I wanted to share for now, it makes no sence what-so-ever for me to dwell into this because the life experiences I have had lead me to believe and understand that folks all over the world will always be blinded by the truth and wouldn't believe it if these crafts were pointed out to them.  Yet a large amount of us believe and preach that there is a God but don't have enough faith to understand the huge fact that heaven is directly above our heads, in space, there are millions of angelic and demonic beings, or just normal like you and I, watching over us or just living their lives out there in different worlds.  We don't have all the answers as facts because we all need to find faith in order ! to get the answers we want or wait untill we die.  That's what makes us God's favorite creation, remember that we are a creation from above.  I searched for many answers during my first experiences and I found many answers with nobody's help.  There will be a time when they will reveil themselves to us with or without the approval of our so-called-leaders. If you believe what I am saying and search for aswers using faith from God then they have a special place for you.",

It was when I was walking along Ocean Parkway in the direction of Avenue X from Avenue Z ,heading to the library on Avenue X, that I had my sighting. Off to my left, I noticed a ,seemingly, toy-like object just above the row of houses. Yes, it was that low to the ground. I quickly realized that this was something very unusual. It was a pyramid-shaped metallic object that was rotating as it was ascending into the sky. When I tell people about it, I describe it as being a pyramid-shaped capsule and as being toy-like. I know it was metallic because the sunlight reflected off of it like sunlight would reflect off a shiny piece of metal. It didn't ascend straight up but actually ,maybe, at a 45 degree angle. The rotation or spin seemed to be somewhat slow but at a steady or consistent rate. Maybe less than a minute after first spotting it, it disappeared through the clouds and I could no longer see it. My current thought on it is that it was taking off ,maybe, from someones roof when I was seeing it. I want to point out that this was in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon and in a main area. It was very busy was alot of traffic and people and there were planes in sky too. There were 2 people that were standing just a couple of feet in front of me ,while I had the sighting. Unfortunately, I didn't say anything to them and I did wish ,afterward, that I had said something. But, there had to be other people who saw it too. I always tell people about it even though the reaction is not good. I made sure that I remembered the date which was on April 06, 2004. I tell people about how  this sighting was traumatizing to me because it ,momentarily, took me out of the reality I was in ,so to speak, and made me aware of another kind of existence. This existence being other-worldly. Being a man of scientific thought, I always try to analyze and understand what I saw. I believe that the object was in some kind of anti-gravity space and it was rotating to provide gravity ,inside of it, for its occupants. But, no matter how much I think about it I can't know how it's doing it. I could only watch in amazement. Just this past year, I came to a startling realization. It is quite possible that these pyramid-shaped objects were commonly seen back thousands of years ago and this could be what inspired the Egyptians and others to build the pyramids. This may be what ancient civilizations did to pay worship to these objects.",

      "story": "Upon my rooftop.  Every night. In the Bronx, New York, I have witnessed hundreds of white or beige ufos chasing blue lights.  The blue are of a beautiful blue color hovering slowly about 16 ft. above our heads.   My nephews and I spend a lot of time on the roof of my apartment building (that I am a former superintendent of) about 6 stories high.  We are located just one block away from the Yankee Stadium. I can guarantee anyone who will come and visit me will indeed witness what we have been witnessing for the past ten years.  They appear so very often about 10 or 15 minutes apart from each other. We're up to a point that we point them out and continue on a different conversation as though we haven't just seen a ufo. Many of my guests have left my premises with their mouths dropped in a state of shock. They hover very closely and extremely obvious.  The white oval ones seem to have a light inside of them and the blue ones seem the same, just a lot smaller.  When the white ones chase the blue ones they catch up and carry them out back towards the direction they came from.  For some funny reason we barely notice an attachment between the two of them.  Seems like a string or a stick like object. Very thin.  These objects never look completely oval, they seem to change shape like some type of liquid metal. Like I said before, anyone can come visit me and we are guaranteed to see a whole bunch, sometimes even fleets of about 20 to 100.",

      "story": "Two aircraft wider than jumbo jets, no lights, flying North to South, in the vicinity of LaGuardia Airport. UFOs over Queens!  I want to type this out while it's still fresh in my mind.  I am not joking here, at the same time I don't think it's ET. I was just taking the garbage out, at 11:40pm and looked up at the sky like I always do to see the position of the planets and such--because I'm an amateur Astronomer. And there I saw two identical, ribbon like objects appearing to be light in color, each wider than a jumbo jet, no lights, gliding North to South. If I had to compare them to known aircraft, I would say they were like giant flying wings, or super wide wing span gliders--but they almost appeared to fly and look more like parasails.  They weren't point towards the front at all like a chevron, just one super wide strip of aircraft, more like parenthesis shaped. When they were nearly overhead they were easy to see, and as they passed they became more and more difficult to see due to the NYC haze. Basically, they flew between my location on 35th Street in Astoria and LaGuardia Airport. I listened for engine noise and thought I could hear jets, but I'm near LaGuardia so of course I hear jets all the time.  It would be more remarkable if I didn't hear the faint sound of jet engines. No other aircraft in the sky that I could see from my position, certainly none displaying their lights. I could not tell how high they were flying due to the fact that they were unrecognizable aircraft with no lights, but they were not at high altitude. If I had to guess, I would say they were just high enough to clear the Manhattan skyline if they wanted to. One of them moved straight across North to South, while the one next to it appeared to bank towards the Southeast for a moment before returning to it's position along side the accompanying craft. They were not moving fast or sporadically.  They were obviously being piloted. Very rarely I see military planes flying in twos along this route, but these were not airplanes of any design I've ever seen--even given my overall love for the sky. 15 minutes ago. I'd say it took about five to eight minutes for them to move across my piece of sky. I would have run in to get my camera and take a picture or video, but it was very dark and the objects would be gone before I had a chance to take the video.

      "story": "Black Tetrahedron Pyramid UFO in plain daylight over New York City. Black Tetrahedron Pyramid UFO   This sighting occurred back in August 7, 1999. On that particular Saturday mid-afternoon day.  A friend and I decided to take a walk down to Riverbank State Park on 145th Manhattan, NY.  We've been there a few times before since he lived and worked at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital a few blocks north from there.  It was our favorite place to hang out and just enjoy the scenery.  From that park you could see over to New Jersey,  The George Washington Bridge, and Downtown and basically up the Hudson River valley as well on a clear day.  My friend and I got to the park and walked all the way down to the south corner of the park next to the basketball courts act... We sat down on the benches right next to the rail facing the Hudson River.  We spoke about work, family, daily normal everyday things, act.... At one point during our conversation I stood up and walked next to the rail and leaned against the rail with my back towards the Hudson River.  My friend lay down on the bench and we kept talking until I for some strange reason looked up and noticed 3 or 4 \"star-liked\" objects just hovering motionless to the east of where i was standing.  I asked my friend to stand up and see something strange up in the sky and so he did.  He told me something around, \"Oh what those stars there,\" but then he told me \"it's weird we're not supposed to see stars that bright during the day\". Then I told him that they\u2019re probably satellites or even balloons and we just basically brush it off and kept talking about other stuff. We stood there for a few more hours.  Then around 5:00pm or so we decided to go get something to eat at a nearby McDonalds and basically started walking back north to exit the park.  As we were walking north right beside the river I noticed again for some strange reason what looked like a \"Black\" dot in the sky. It stood out to me because the sky was completely blue no clouds, haze nothing. This object was hovering motionless near the Manhattan side of the G.W.Bridge precisely on top or near 3 tall buildings used by Columbia Presbyterian Hospital as dorms for medical students or something my friend told me.  He knew since like I said he worked at the hospital in the Administration Dept.  I found it very odd so I ask my friend to walk fast to nearby sight-seeing binoculars that they have in that park to see over to New Jersey, G. W. Bridge act\u2026  At the same time that I was walking I was looking in my jeans pocket for 50 cents to paid in order to use the binoculars and happens to be that I had precisely that 2 quarters so I got to the machine put the money and first located the G.W. Bridge since it was the biggest thing, then located the 3 buildings nearby and then moved the binoculars a little up from the buildings and lord behold there was the \u201cBlack! Dot\u201d which wasn\u2019t really a \u201cBlack Dot\u201d but a Black Tetrahedro! n Pyramid Object sitting motionless on an angle right on top of one of the buildings. This object was completely black. It had not markings what so ever, no symbols, letters, windows, and doors I mean nothing. It was just black sort of \"gun metal black.\" The only thing that had in each bottom corners was plasma-like circular lights. These lights emanated some sort of heat. Sort of like the sun, yes they reminded me of the sun. It was like it had 3 suns in each corner.  The object also didn\u2019t rotate or nothing it was just there motionless.   At that point I was just ecstatic in a euphoric state debating whether I was seeing this or if it was all in my mind.  I quickly turn to my friend which was standing right next to me asking me what was what I was seeing.  Why I was reacting the way I was reacting. I told him you have to see this come so I let him used the binoculars and told him where to look so he did but he couldn\u2019t see find it. I looked with my eyes to see if I saw the black dot but it just vanish as quickly as it appeared.  The rest of the day we just spoke about what had happened. I almost forgot to mention that prior to seen the triangle I had seen a black helicopter pass us by when we were walking towards the binoculars to see what the black dot was.  This army type helicopter was really low to the river.  I found that very odd.  This particular sighting is just one of many sightings I have had since childhood.",

Three of the objects flashed kind of slowly, so that it alternated between a white flash and a black sphere.   The one on the South East Corner of the triangle stayed illuminated.

It was around 9 or 10:00 at night when we were in this deserted street, I looked up and saw this object, it was a bit fuzzy because it looked like the moon behind some clouds.  Thing is, there was no clouds in the sky, so after a while of staring at it i point at it for my girlfriend could see.  She immediately said it was a UFO, but i was questioning it.  First, i saw a Blue light (which i thought was the clouds) illiminating all around it.  It had the classic UFO shape, you know, sort of like an oblate spheroid.   This is what i saw:  It had a classic UFO shape A bright blue light illuminating it a smaller red lighting under the center and it was actually relively close for us to judge that it was not a plane.  There were many planes flying around us because there's an airport near by.  But living in New York you can tell what's a plane and what's not.  This definetly wasn't. I started naming things it CAN be. I thought it was a hellicopter. Because of the bright light. But what canceled it out is   1.  If a search helicopter was out, the lights wouldn't have been around it, and the chopper would've been smaller; 2.  If it was a larger chopper, it could possibly be that shape at a distance, but not from this distance; 3.  The object was moving VERY slow, almost still, and kept at the same altitude  We watched and walked for 10 minutes or so and it was actually following us, very slowly.  There was this point where we were walking but keeping an eye where a building go in the way, we speed walked passed it and in that time (about 5 seconds) it was already in front of us.  It amazing us because it was going soo slow, but randomly zooms passed us.   We kept watching and i noticed the red light, it would blink not too often.  Also if it were a plane,  1.  It'll blink repeatedly;  2.  It would definitely not be as bright as that.  We watched more, till it got smaller, like it was moving away, we watched till it fell behind some tree's and it was gone, we then saw it about 5 minutes later for a few seconds then lost it again. What's really got me is the bright blue light around it.  It truthfully looked like a force field or energy wall.  It was truly amazing, i really never believed in aliens but this is getting me to question it. P.S my girlfriend had taken pictures, it's very legit",

      "story": "Glowing, bi-convex, disc-shaped craft cruised up the canyons of Manhattan in daylight for all to see. Ninth Avenue UFO Incident New York City Summer 1974 The Complete Story    I am an accomplished artist (painter) and actor (theatre and film) who has worked with Rod Steiger, Burt Reynolds, Peter Boyle, John Turturro and Dennis Farina among many others.  This is the story behind a UFO event that occurred in New York City during the summer of 1974.  It was totally blacked-out on the TV news and not reported (to the best of my knowledge) in the press at the time.  This event may well be one of the biggest cover-ups in the history of UFO sightings.  This was not just some distant light in the sky, but an actual bi-convex craft, with an insignia on it, that came down and slowly (about 45 miles per hour), with multi-colored lights blinking in what appeared to be programmed sequences, literally cruised up the canyons of Manhattan in daylight for all to see.  I was working at the time for Joe Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theatre.  I was helping to build and decorate sets for various productions.  We were doing &quot;Pericles&quot; and &quot;Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; up in Central Park at the Delacorte Theatre there.  I believe it was toward the end of June or the beginning of July.  I wrote the exact dates down at the time, but I have been unable to find the paper with them on as this happened many years ago and I assume it has been lost or thrown out by accident.  I was asked to take a load of costumes downtown that needed last minute alterations.  We loaded them into the Festival van and I drove out of the park and headed down Columbus Avenue which turns into Ninth Avenue farther down.  As I headed downtown at about 6:30 pm, I noticed what appeared to be very bright lights of some sort, way downtown, perhaps in the 20s or 30s.  I thought it might be a large neon sign or something for a store opening or maybe a movie premiere of some sort.  As I got to the 60s near Lincoln Center I could tell that the lights were moving and coming closer up the avenue.  As it got closer and closer, I couldn't believe what I was then able to see.  It was a craft of some kind, very high tech-looking, heading directly for me.  It was just above the tops of five-story buildings on the avenue and it spanned the width of the entire street  It was circular in shape, but tilted up slightly so it looked like an ellipse.  The convex bottom was glowing a bright, iridescent greenish-yellow, almost like neon, with a Saturn-like rectangular shaped circular band, around the circumference of the craft, of bright green, which had small multi-colored lights (red, yellow, blue, etc.) set in it.  The band protruded from the craft all the way around.  The lights were blinking in what appeared to be programmed sequences.  There were two large, very bright, red, beacon-like lights (one on each side of the craft), oval in shape (horizontally), which extended from the green circular band.  They were flashing on and off somewhat slowly, almost like a pulse.  I kept saying to myself, &quot;What the hell is that?!!&quot;  I just could not believe what I was actually seeing.  I don't remember feeling any fear, though, because it looked so beautiful and non-threatening.  And the blinking lights were moving in such pleasing patterns that they made me feel happy (perhaps that was their intended effect).  I had the distinct feeling that they (whoever &quot;they&quot; were) were having some fun and just saying, &quot;Hi!&quot;  There was an insignia on the bottom of the craft, on the curved part toward the front, not the exact middle of the bottom, which appeared to be recessed in the yellow made of thick black lines.  I believe it was composed of three symbols, almost like a logo.  I had never seen anything like them before.  They looked like a foreign alphabet or symbol system of some kind as the craft passed directly over me as I drove beneath it, nearing the Lincoln Tunnel, in the 50s.  Many other people saw it.  I could see people standing on the sidewalks looking and staring up at it.  The sky was still light at that hour, so I could see it wasn't being held up by a helicopter or something like that.  This was certainly not a blimp or a balloon of some kind.  It looked solid and real.  It was still rush-hour and there was a lot of traffic trying to get out of the city through the tunnel, so I couldn't stop, and I also had only about an hour to get the costumes taken care of and get back up to the theatre in time for the opening.  I didn't think they would take it well if the show was late going up and the reason I gave was that I had seen a UFO on Ninth Avenue!  I figured that this incident would be all-over the news when I got home.  Later that evening, I rushed home thinking that this was big news and that they would probably even be pre-empting the regular shows to cover it.  When I got home I flipped on the TV and channel surfed around the dial, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.  I remember thinking that was very strange and decided to wait for the 11:00 o'clock news.  Again, at 11:00, there was only the usual local news, weather and sports.  Nothing about the UFO, not even a denial, anywhere.  I thought maybe they were trying to figure out how to deal with it and were delaying coverage.  So, I went to bed thinking I'll check the newspapers early in the morning because this has got to be front page headline stuff.  When I awoke, I went down to the corner newsstand and checked the first few pages of several main newspapers -- there was nothing at all about it.  Unless there was a small blurb in the back pages, but I doubt it. This started to instill some fear and paranoia in me, because I then realized that the government could totally censor and block or kill a story.  And I always had believed we had a free press -- but after this I certainly didn't believe that anymore.  A few days later I was eating lunch near the prop department down at the Public Theatre when a gal I knew who worked in the department came in.  She had almost straight, longish, light-blond, slightly reddish hair and freckles, and looked somewhat ethereal -- a very pretty gal.  I said to her, &quot;You're not going to believe what I saw fly up Ninth Avenue the other evening.&quot;  Her face went ashen and she blurted, &quot;I know what you're talking about, I saw it, too!&quot;  She said she had been shopping for props for &quot;Wives&quot; and had just come out of a store on West 57th Street between Eighth and Ninth, and that she and a couple of hundred other people saw it go by as it headed up the avenue.  We discussed it a bit, and she said she had seen exactly the same craft as I had seen.  I asked her if there was anything in the newspapers about it, but she said, no, she didn't see anything.  And then she started to get a bit freaked-out and said, &quot;I can't talk a! bout this anymore.  I don't want to talk about it.  I won't talk about it.  I don't want to continue this discussion.&quot;  She then abruptly rushed out of the room in a somewhat agitated state.  Probably because the reality of it, and what it implied, had just really sunk in. I can't remember her name now, but I think it was Jane something -- but I can't say for sure.  I intend, at some point, to check with the Festival for a list of people that worked in props that summer and see if I can locate her.  I now believe beyond any doubt whatsoever that UFOs are real.  I know that they're here, because I've seen them up-close -- and I know what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It sounded like and felt like a helicopter was coming towards us from north new york headed south towards an international airport just a mile away from our location.  I knew it wasnt a plane because it was way to low.I looked up to see what kind of helicopter was coming,but what i seen was no helicopter.  It was about a hundred feet in the air moving very slowly.  I was right under it.  It was like an octagon shape with lights surronding it.  It must have been over a hundred feet wide.  I compared it to the building it was flying over.  It continued to move slow until it passed us across the street from the corner we were on.  It started to hover over a tree on the other corner across the street.  Then all of a sudden it just beemed straight up into the sky and vanished.I ve never seen anything move so fast it must have been faster than a blink.  I looked at my friend and I knew he seen it too by the paleness and open mouth, because I had that same look.  The other guy is looking at us funny and says whats wrong with you guys, you look like you seen a ghost!  We both shouted at the same time did you not see that?  The tree is now dead I think.

I looked up to the sky in search of the source of this screeching sound and I saw a series of strange somethings.

My friends and I retreated via the lift to our flats where we all most urgently had to use the loo out of stark terror!  We thought we were going to be abducted.  The worst part is that it went on and on, these lights and bangs. When I looked out of my window I saw the fire department there in the park as well.

It was also close or large enough that I think the deflated balloon falling would have been visible.  This was over buildings in Brooklyn or the Brooklyn/Queens border.  I am not sure how long it was visible out my window, as when I looked! up I only observed it for 7-10 seconds before it vanished.

      "story": "Silent V-Shaped Craft seen flying over Brooklyn NY! I live in Brooklyn, New York.  Right across the East River in Williamsburg, giving me a clean shot of the Lower East Side, Manhattan and the surrounding skyline from the roof top of my apartment building.  To the Northeast I can see the Queens-based La Guardia airport and almost directly South is JFK.  I sit outside a few times every night to have a cigarette and pay very close attention to the sky and I know what conventional aircraft look like.  Since it\u2019s NYC I\u2019ve seen plenty of military craft as well, aircraft that the normal Joe-Schmoe doesn\u2019t see every day.  Anything from F16 Fighter Jets, Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopters (when the President is in town), Chinook helicopters and once I even saw an Osprey flying over the East River Harbor.  Long story short, I\u2019m very used to seeing unconventional craft in the sky as well. I stepped outside onto my roof for a cigarette around 12:30am, as I normally do (since I don\u2019t smoke inside my apartment) and when I looked up, I noticed how bright the stars were.  There aren\u2019t many nights in New York City when the stars are visible.  There wasn\u2019t a cloud in the sky and I was enjoying being able to see Orion\u2019s Belt as I puffed away.  Then it came into my line of vision.  A very mysterious craft or UFO that flew directly over my head!  Now I can see planes flying into both Airports nearby and not once has any commercial flight flown directly overhead of my building.  If this craft was the size of a normal commercial flight, then it was flying at a severely low altitude.   It was very hard to comprehend the size, especially because there was no noise.  If it was a large commercial flight then it was way too low for FAA regulations, especially this close to Ground Zero (9/11).  The best explanation from what I directly witnessed, is it was flying at a high alt! itude and was just immensely huge, possibly the length of a football field.  It was in my line of vision for around 7-10 seconds before it disappeared behind the Williamsburg Bridge.  I ran down the fire escape on the side of my building praying that I would catch a glimpse of it again once it passed the bridge, or at least see some FAA lights.  Nothing.  It was gone, as so were my chances to photograph it. The best way to describe it is the typical V-Shape that is pretty common in UFO sightings.  There were 5 lights.  One at the tip, then two down each side, perfectly symmetrical and at a perfect angle.  The lights were very large, circular and the light emitted was diffused, almost as if they were behind a haze.  Remember it was clear enough to see Orion\u2019s Belt directly across from Manhattan, so it was a crystal clear night.  Other planes that were further away by miles had sharper looking lights and were more visible.   I was glad that I was looking at the stars or I would have never seen it because of how muted it was.  There were NO FAA lights on it whatsoever.  No headlights, no beacon lights, no red lights and definitely nothing flashing.  The lights that were present were a very soft white-yellowish color and did NOT flash. The body looked to follow the contours of the lights although it was hard to make out a solid surface.  It was almost like you could see through the! craft while just making out the signatures of its edges but I couldn\u2019t see the stars behind it.  There was no sound what so ever.  It seemed to fly at a high speed very effortlessly. When I had realized what I had seen it took my breath away.  My heart jumped straight up into my throat and I actually had a hard time breathing for a minute and I think I mumbled the \u201cf\u201d word to myself a few times.  I am 100% convinced that what I saw, I was not supposed to have seen.  It was very faint, lasted only for a few seconds, and was unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen in the night sky or in my life for that matter.  I\u2019m not saying that it was extraterrestrial, but if it wasn\u2019t then it was some sort of top-secret aircraft that hasn\u2019t been disclosed by the government.  It is something that I will remember for the rest of my life.",

I was walking down Metropolitan Ave in the Bronx (Parkchester area)by the Macy's Department store.  I happened to look up at the sky and through a clearing in the clouds witnessed what appeared as two bright, orange glowing orbs flying in formation at a steady speed to the North-East. They did not make any sounds as attributed to regular aircraft.  There were no blinking lights as you would most likely see on regular aircraft.  I observed them for approximately 30 seconds moving through the clouds (the clouds would obscure them at times) until they started to move behind the buildings in the area and I lost sight of them.  As I tried to move to the other side of the street, I witnessed the third glowing orb flying the in the same direction, but far behind the other two bright glowing orbs.  At that point I called my brother in the Westchester Square area of the Bronx, and asked him to access the rooftop of his building to see see if he could observe what I was looking at.  He saw all three glowing orbs in the direction of Parchester as they flew in the same northeasterly direction, and continued to observe them until he lost visibility due to the cloud cover.  He also did not notice any blinking lights or sounds. I was a practicing amateur astronomer for several years, and I would not report this if I knew they were ordinary astronomical phenomena.  This was actually very unusual and I have never witnessed anything like this before.  Thank you.",

Approx a week ago, after midnight, my husband was woken up by a tapping sound on his bedroom window but did not pay any attention and continued to sleep.  He woke up the next morning and did not forget that ackward tapping on the window.  At night he'd see through his peripheral vision things that flashed by but would not relate to as being important.  At 3:00AM the tapping and the scratching on the window awoke him, he had his smartphone under the pillow and slowly focused and snap the picture of what appeared to be a \"metal looking alien\" with 6-8 metal antennas.  As he snapped the picture before he ran out of the bedroom he noticed that it was backing away. My husband never returned to that bedroom instead he went to the bathroom and observe the picture that he had taken.  He became very nervous and did not go back to sleep.   We have a very clear picture and I've called and spoken to Mr. Davenport Director of UFO Center and will send the email with the linked picture taken ~ 2 feet away from the window.  He is extremely concerned for his safety.  I'm requesting a returned email @ ((e-address deleted)) at someone's earliest convenience.  Thanking you in advance for your attention to this matter.

      "story": "Two UFO sightings while looking at and from the Statue Of Liberty. Wednesday March 7th.  My 3 year old couldn\u2019t sleep, I was showing him what the Statue of Liberty was.  We were looking at Presidential Dollars and he asked if the picture on the reverse was god, I said no, and tried to explain what it was.  Then it hit me I could show him a picture. After a couple links I stumbled on http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_torch I found it amazing that you can view NY through a live feed from Liberty\u2019s Torch. After I started panning around at aprox 11:15 pm I noticed a floating light above the city.  I had caught it while it was on the left hand side of the panoramic view.  The light was white, solid & rectangular the length of the light iliminated any possibility of an air craft.  I\u2019ve never seen anything in that shape so clear and uniform. I had to capture what I was seeing and remembered that I downloaded a plugin where you can capture screen shots.  I\u2019d yet to use it but thought this would be the perfect time. My first attempt at taking the screen capture got screwed up from lack of use.  And bye the time I made it back to the web site and back to the live feed looking out the torch into NY.  The light had moved a considerable distance, and now was three \u00bc\u2019s across the panoramic screen and much further away.  Now its 11:20pm but this time I was able to capture the light with a screen capture.   You can still make out the odd shape of the light and still have a pretty good view ! when zooming in. But the next thing I saw is really amazing! When looking directly at the Statue of Liberty in full frontal view.  A long object can easily be seen with multiple color lights just off the right side of Lady Liberty and extending all the way out of the shot.  The placement of the object can\u2019t be horizon lights or anything like that.  And I just checked the live cameras during the day to double check, and nothing is visible.  And the great thing is I was able to take two pictures of the object. If I was to guess what I was looking at I\u2019d say it was a large oval but flattened shaped fly saucer and I was seeing the side that  was closest to me, and when you zoom in on the picture it does appear to confirm these thoughts.  I\u2019ve got multiple pictures that allow you to zoom in and can send them to whom ever, I hope they come out right when I post this.",

With a small digital camera, I recorded photos and video.  Samples of photos and video will, as in previous sightings I have reported, be provided via e-mail/links to NUFORC for review. During the sighting two other witnesses joined me for at least a portion of the time:  (1) another resident of the house (the son of the landlord), and (2) a maintenance person who was returning from an errand to complete a sink repair in my home.  I pointed the object out to them.  We were all perplexed. The object was not stationary, but moved around in the sky for about 50 minutes, varying in brightness, altitude and relative visibility. A local UFO reporting / research group (to which I belong) agreed that the object does not appear to be a balloon or star.  I believe the following could also be ruled out:  airplane, helicopter, standard drone, plastic bag, glider, satellite, bird, toy/kite, blimp. NOTE: At the end of the sighting, chemtrail activity was observed to begin.  It is unclear as to whether this could have been related to the observed incident.  A separate 2009 sighting I reported (which included similar activity) resulted in the NUFORC informing me that chemtrail activity appears not to be a real phenomenon.  Again, as in 2009, it is not my intention to debate the topic of chemtrails, but rather to report the details of the crafts / orbs I observe.  These reports sometimes include airplane activity during or after the event that creates visible contrails or \"chemtrails.\"  SAMPLE PHOTOS AND VIDEO LINK WILL BE SENT TO NUFORC. This is my fifth UFO sighting report to NUFORC.  The other four were for sightings that took place on: 1.  2/6/97 (Mesa, AZ)---Original report was updated with map. 2.  4/26/09 (Brooklyn, NY)---Orb 3.  5/14/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Lights 4.  7/10/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Brilliant light / orb (NOTE: this is a resubmission of this report.

She awoke her husband Richard and he saw it also.\"  notice just before the story begins, they drew a diagram of the cross in the sky on the paper. they drew a second diagram at the top of the next page also. the church of the transfiguration is in chinatown nyc on mott street. so mrs. kinder was in nyc on baxter street (1 block west of mott street) looking east. baxter st. at the time was the famous slum called 5 points which is the background for the martin scorscese film \"gangs of ny\". in 1861, there  were no airplanes, no tall buildings but churches, no television, no reality shows to make you famous, and so i believe the woman and her husband saw something sincerely and told a priest thinking it was a vision from god. the light emanating from the head of the cross was obviously a cockpit's light and the cross was a craft. btw, a garrit window is like an attic window in today's cape cod type homes. i researched the newspapers for nyc the following day to see if this could be corraberated. i found a very interesting story that on canal street about 6 blocks away from baxter street  a warehouse, a book bindery and a LABOROATORY went on fire and the entire city block burned to the ground the same evening as the cross in the sky. my theory is this: the cross was a type aircraft. the fire illuminated the belly of this metallic aircraft and so it's fusilage glowed like a cross as the flames from the fire lit it up from below otherwise it never would have beeen noticed. remember according to the witness it was dark and clear with no moon.  i also wonder what was in the laboratory that burned down.",

Then noise stopped suddently after about two minutes and imediately after i heard multiple helicopers in the sky as if they were following what was making the noise.  The helicoper and the unidentified noise were very different.  The unidentified sound was louder and like a pulsing siren, a siren with low bass. Description - At this point i went to look out of my window.  Slightly above the building directly across from me was a line of slowly flashing lights from left to right.  The body of the craft wasnt visible but the lights were in a perfect line like a disk shape.  These lights flashed blue and red.  The lights were steady as stars in the sky until minutes later when it grew in size as if it came closer then drifted off to the right.",

They use a type of L.E.D. spotlight which illuminates the clouds causing an illusion that the light is coming from behind the clouds.  They also put off very little, if any beam.  L.E.D. lights have a very long range, so they can appear to be moving several miles very quickly.  These particular lights can be seen on most Friday and Saturday nights when it is cloudy.  They are visable anywhere from Brooklyn to almost the South Bronx. Sorry!  I was quite perplexed myself at first.  I was a little Bummed when I found out.  They are weird though!",

      "story": "Brooklyn--8/21/13--Moving bright light vanishes. On Wednesday 8/21/13, I saw a moving light in the sky over Windsor Terrace Brooklyn.  Details follow. At approximately 9:30pm, I decided to go for a walk and look at the large bright moon.  I ended up standing in the center of a large blacktop area; the playground just northwest of East 5th Street and Ocean Parkway/Fort Hamilton Parkway (which borders the Prospect Expressway, situated east of the playground and near the Fort Hamilton Parkway subway stop).  I chose this spot partly because the light pollution is a bit lower than in other parts of the neighborhood. From this vantage point, there is a 360 degree panoramic view of a large portion of sky/partially blocked by trees to the west and structures near the ground.  The sky was clear and winds were low, perhaps with some slight breeze.  For a few moments I observed the moon, which was southeast of my position.  I also turned to view other stars (the relative few that can be seen in Brooklyn), including Vega which appears to be visible at night (and was essentially directly overhead according to a sky map application I was using to assist me). Looking slightly northwest towards Greenwood Cemetery, and the house I live in, I noticed a white light (no beam) moving in a curved trajectory southeastward towards my direction.  If the estimated lateral distance from my position to the object (0.4 miles) is accurate, the light itself could have been between 2 \u2013 4 feet in size. The incident took place for about 10 - 15 seconds sometime between 9:40 and 9:43pm.  This time includes the object\u2019s approach (about 5 \u2013 6 seconds) and several seconds of attempting to follow it with my eyes as it dimmed and disappeared (when near to my position). Its altitude seemed to vary slightly.  Though it is difficult to determine an exact average altitude, it was similar to or slightly below nearby commercial airline traffic (typically approaching JFK or LaGuardia Airports), approximately 1,500 \u2013 2,000 feet.  This ruled out the possibility of a very large satellite (though on 8/24, at 9:49pm when revisiting I noticed a high plane or potential satellite, that appeared far, far higher and more dim, traveling northward east of the same position where I was standing).  Given the brightness and size of the light, it did not appear to be a small plane that was situated farther away than one may presume (lateral distance or altitude). This white light varied in brightness and was not accompanied by any blinking FAA or navigation lights.  There was no sound (unlike the helicopters and planes which could be heard in the area at different moments before and after the sighting).  The curved trajectory of the light changed my view from looking northwest to slightly southwest, then almost directly south.  When I attempted to view it through my camera phone, it did not seem to register, though lights from other planes or helicopters around the same time did register (so I attempted no pictures or video).  During the 8/24 revisit, I noticed that lights from planes, etc. do show up more readily on my digital camera.  As such, perhaps the 8/22 light in questions would have been visible had I had my camera (non-phone) with me. I expected to gain a view of FAA lighting or hear noise from an object, or at least see its shape as its path took it near or directly over Public School 130 (situated about 100 meters away from my vantage point, south of Ocean Parkway / Fort Hamilton Parkway and East 5th).  Instead the light increased in intensity, then simply faded out (with no visible clouds in the area to obscure it).  Again, because of the ambient light in the vicinity, the silhouetted shape and possibly some detail of any helicopter, quadcopter, drone, plane, blimp or other flying object would likely have become visible (as with other air traffic I observed around the same time and in nearby airspace from the same vantage point), even if its lights were turned off or away from my view.  However, to my astonishment, once the white light disappeared, no object could be seen in spite of my deliberate effort to follow it with my eyes.  The light appeared to be moving far too slowly, and for too long in a h! orizontal fashion, to be a meteorite.  Note that on the 8/24 revisit to the site, a meteorite / shooting star was observed at 9:46pm, traveling west on a trajectory that was slightly south of my vantage point (it seemed very different from what I saw on 8/22). Again, I estimate the visible length of distance travelled by the object to have been 0.4 miles (about 640 meters or 2,099 feet).  Therefore the speed over the 5 \u2013 6 second approach is estimated at approximately 238 - 286mph. Based on the potential size of the light (2 \u2013 4 feet) and potentially achievable altitude (1,500 \u2013 2,000 feet), the most likely prosaic explanation I could determine was quadcopter.  However, I am not confident that the approximate speed of the observed light (238 \u2013 286 mph), or estimated distance of flight (0.4 miles) are achievable for this type of product.  Note that I did not observe any object fall from the sky or crash, as might be expected if a quadcopter simply flew beyond its maximum lateral range.. Perhaps there is a prosaic explanation for this incident; however, I am not able to determine what it may be at this time.  Perhaps others can shed further insight. NOTE:  In an attempt to determine if others in the area may have witnessed similar phenomenon recently, I spoke with several individuals who live in or near the neighborhood.  One young man reported that on Wednesday 8/21 (same night as the sighting reported here), but at a later hour, he observed two lights in the same airspace (near the playground) move together and apart several times before departing in different/opposite directions!  Another young man reported recently seeing a beam of light near Caton Avenue in broad daylight.  While I cannot vouch for either of these accounts, I submit a summary of them to demonstrate that (a) it seems much easier than expected at this time to locate others nearby who feel they have seen something out of the ordinary and (b) there seems to be a number of incidents occurring over time (as I have observed lights /orbs in this neighborhood for years which cannot be easily explained).  The URL to view the approximate flight path of the light is: http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=6057182  The URL to view the lateral distance from my vantage point to PS130 is: http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=6057188  This is my seventh UFO sighting report to NUFORC.

It was more then one light it was about 10.  They didnt seem to have any pattern shape to them as to show if it was an object like a plane or helicopter. It more looked like individual lights floating on their own.   As I took my phone out to take pictures the lights that looked like dots or stars started moving around in all directions as in scattering.  I finally took a few pictures with and without flash.  Alot of them have disappeared by the time I took the picture.  But I did get to capture! a few and you can notice the lights are not a shape to anything like an airplane or helicopter.  A few moments after I took the picture the remainder dots that was in the sky ended up disappearing little by little.  I was able to view them getting further away until it was small enough it just disappeared.

Then I saw a light high in the sky appear out of nowhere.  And right afterwards, like 2 seconds, another one appeared.  And then I called my Mom and my brother and told them to get their phones and then another one appeared. We didn\u2019t get our phones in time and then as they went into the distance, they vanished \u2013 disappeared.  But they flickered out before completely disappearing. A little while later, from the opposite direction from where the other ones came from, a smaller white one fly over and I didn\u2019t see it vanish but it flew past where we could see (buildings got in the way). The first three were a bright orange, They were circular with a big circle of light on the inside.  The smaller circle in the middle gave off the most light.  (My Mom describes them as bright arcs with a very bright middle circular light in the middle.)  After the first 4 passed, we all went inside thinking no more would come.  But then my Mom reminded me to finish the chore I went out there for, I went and saw that two more appeared out of nowhere as they did before. So, I ran inside and got my phone and took a video of what I saw. This happened around 9:33pm on Saturday, June 23rd, 2013.  Oh, and our upstairs neighbor saw the same lights while coming home from the store earlier than we did.  Then he caught the tail end of what we saw when he went into his apartment upstairs.",

I woke up that mor! ning sun shining, I never spoke of it until I was 38 yrs old.  However I do have the ability to see things and places that I have never been before but can describe them.

      "story": "orb or throgsneck bridge Sometime in the late 1960's probably close to 1966 my family of 6 were traveling north on the throgsneck bridge just prior to sunrise.  We were traveling to PA in the family station wagon and in the car were my parents, my sister, 2 brothers and myself.  I believe I was about 6 to 8 years old, my sister was about 12 years old and my brothers were a year younger and a year older then me.  The traffic was light and the sky was clear and bright enough that the cars did not need to have there headlights on. When we were probably about 2/3 of the way across the bridge, my entire family other than my parents recall seeing an extremely large light green glowing orb hovering above the bridge and so close to it that we all remember my sister screaming because she thought this orb was going to hit the bridge and knock it down.  This entire sighting lasted probably no longer than 10 seconds and no one remembers observing this orb flying away as it just seemed to disappear. An explanation as to why my parents who were in the front seat did not observe this orb is possibly because my sister and I were seated in the far back of the station wagon which were rear facing seats and that orb did not appear until we were 2/3 of the way across the bridge and it was behind when it 1st appeared.  My parents remember everyone screaming and yelling about what we had seen and they clearly remember the incident. This orb had no distinguishing marks and the entire family agrees that it was not the moon or the sun. As for the size of the orb, I would say at least 300 yds in diameter and I might be underestimating it by quite a bit.  The distance that it was from the bridge I would estimate 300yds or maybe even closer. This incident was never discussed again until about 20 years later at a family reunion when someone brought up ufos and for some reason we all remembered the incident like it happened yesterday. Without a doubt there had to be numerous other witnesses to this sighting because of the clear day, the size of the object and how close it was to the bridge.

For orientation, my position would have put the Statue of Liberty to the southwest at approximately my 8:00.  From my perspective (about 15 feet elevated from ground level) the helicopters were at 30-40 degrees off horizon.  I thought the behavior of the helicopters odd, and wanted to video it, but managed only to get a series of photographs them (on a Droid Razr phone).  In reviewing the photos, I found one photo shows what appeared to be a cylindrical object, at a slight cant, reflecting light with a glassy aspect, in the vicinity of the helicopters.

There had been airplanes passing above and near us.  We could HEAR them but not SEE them because that's how cloudy it was. So anyway we were sitting there and we saw a BRIGHT green neon light orb looking about hmm a mile away.  It was hovering and then switched to a bright red/white light and then back to green. It was a constant green light.  It was NOT flashing.  The only time it flashed was when it was red/white for like 4 seconds.  The light was moving really fast towards us. (South) and then it went back really quickly and then it was moving downwards really fast and then to the sides..  THIS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN AIRPLANE or a JET or helicopter.. the angles it was moving in were crazy.  Kinda like zig zags. & then it vanished into thin air. This happen last night.. at about 12:30 am. It only lasted for about 35-40 seconds.  Tried to capture it with my iphone but it was too dark and far to make out..

During the 30 minutes of observation numerous jets crisscrossed the sky, many at extreme altitude, but the points seemed to be higher.

      "story": "3 orange orbs over Brooklyn, NY At 12:10am on June 30th, 2014, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY, my wife and I went out on our patio for a cigarette.  I went out before her, lit my smoke and from the top of the stairs to our patio, my wife asked asked, \u201cWhat are those?  They aren\u2019t planes.\u201d  I looked up to where she was pointing to the SSW.  There were two orangish orbs that were flickering slightly. The first thought I had was that they were Chinese Lanterns.  However, the hair on the back of my neck stood up as I realized that they were moving towards us and, far too fast to be any sort of lantern or balloon.  The objects appeared to be at 2,000 - 3,000 feet in altitude, moving at 200-300 miles per hour.  The two objects traveled silently and in apparent formation, perhaps 2,500 feet apart.  They traveled at a constant rate and did not change bearing. As the objects approached, not quite overhead, but maybe offset by about 15-degrees from directly overhead, I noticed that the glowing, flickering orange nearly disappeared and I was able to observe the underside of the objects, which appeared round in shape with a dark center and a ring of somewhat dim, fuzzy light around it.  The two objects disappeared behind our building.  I considering running through the front of the apartment to see if I could observe the objects on the other side of the building.  My wife ran inside to grab her camera.  She returned just as a third orb appeared and followed a similar vector to the other two objects. Again, as the third object passed nearly overhead, I observed the same structure as the first two objects.  My wife was able to get one very nondescript, streaked image with her camera but honestly, it doesn\u2019t look like much. The entire incident lasted perhaps 30-40 seconds.  After the three objects had passed, my wife and I were somewhat shaken and tried to make any sense of what we had just seen.   They clearly were not any sort of aircraft or drone that I have seen (and I consider myself an aircraft aficionado along with being a drone and R/C aircraft pilot).  The other thought I had were that perhaps they were some sort of debris entering the atmosphere and burning up, but that would not account for what appeared to be a level flight path. About a minute or so after this, a commercial aircraft crossed the flight path of the objects at a perpendicular angle, heading east.  I have no idea if the pilot of that airliner, likely landing at JFK, was able to see what had just occurred, but I suppose we have no way of knowing.  We checked the internet for any other reports of this incident and found nothing, which is astonishing considering it occurred over New York City.  However, we found Nuforc and filed this report in hopes of anyone else coming out and reporting this.",

      "story": "small grey/silver metallic object, mostly circular in shape seen hovering and moving slowly at high altitude over the Hudson River While spending Memorial day weekend in the Long Island/NYC area, I visited the USS Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum.  The day was Sunday, May 25th, 2014.   After touring the top deck and interior I made my way down the stairs to the adjacent dock area.  There were already multiple news and tour helicopters making their way up the Hudson River, while a US Coast Guard MH-65 was performing a Search and Rescue Demo (for NY Fleet Week) over the waterfront so naturally I had my eyes towards the sky, at just after noon (anywhere between 12:00 and 12:30) I noticed a small object at high altitude over the Hudson.   At first I suspected it to be merely a balloon, however after examining the object for a few seconds I noticed it appeared to be considerably larger than a normal balloon and it was hovering in place as if not affected by the present winds which a balloon would be.  Its coloration was also interesting, it appeared to mostly be a metallic grey or silver on the! surface.  I pointed it out to my father who quickly dismissed it as probably being a balloon (although he said he couldn't see it very well).  I began snapping photos of the object with my IPhone 5. I estimated the objects altitude to be around 4,000-5,000 feet because it was a lot higher than the helicopters flying up the Hudson but much lower than the occasional passing commercial airliner out of JFK airport, I had no way of guessing the objects size due to its distance and lack of anything close enough to it to compare it with, though it did appear to be larger than a balloon.   After a few minutes the object began a slow flight path moving diagonally but remaining at the same altitude, I began backing up to keep the object in view while taking pictures but it soon passed over the deck of the Intrepid and out of sight.  Although I didn't run into any other witnesses I think it is unlikely that I was the only one who saw it due to the sheer number of people in the area.   Upon uploading and reviewing the photos on my computer the following day, I noticed several things that I didn't notice while viewing the object,  The first few pictures showed exactly what I saw, a small rounded shiny metallic object hovering.  However, as I looked through the pictures I noticed the object had a darker, shaded edge in some pictures giving it more of a definitive shape (this may have been due to the sun reflecting from the other side of the object) while in other photos the object appeared to be very bright and shiny.  One of the photos the object is completely dark except for a small ring of light in the center that appears to be generated by the object, the rest of the object appears much more like a structured craft here with less of a circular shape and two corners on one side.  The final photos show the object again to be metallic and silver with the upper half being brighter (almost a whitish blue) and the lower half being a darker grey, there are also several dark patches on the edges of the object.  I have always been intrigued by the UFO phenomenon but have mostly remained a skeptic however I am questioning it now.  All I can say is that while knowing a lot about aviation and can easily identify most airplanes or helicopters, this object I witnessed and photographed did not move like or resemble any normal aircraft that I have seen in my life.",

It wasn't going very fast, but I only caught it from the time it took to travel in between two buildings in my field of vision. The best way I can describe the light is that it looked like an orange flare. It would dim from time to time and then flare up again. I thought it might be a helicopter, but I've never seen a helicopter undulate like that (and they generally have running lights, etc, instead of a single orange light). I am not sure at what altitude the clouds were, I don\u2019t think they were particularly high, but this object seemed to be just underneath them. I viewed the object for 30 seconds or less.

We had a few bottles of wine, so we were a little warm, but not incoherent.  It was bright out because of the supermoon, so we had a clear view.   My friend, who pointed in the air, then told us to look.  3 of the 4 of us saw what looked like a thick blackish-gray disc, hovering in the air a few hundred feet out.  It was not a plane, because we had seen many moving around that night.   I thought it was a balloon floating up but my friend and I stood up and approached the edge of the rooftop to get a better view and I quickly ruled that out.  What I personally saw was something that looked large enough to not be a balloon, and it was definitely oscillating.  It made no sound, but I did not expect it to at our distance.   I rationalized at first it was a balloon floating from the light into the atmosphere and thus disappearing, but something was off about that idea.  However, as I approached it went from a darker color to gray, and then disappeared almost as if backing away.   We all 3 were very creeped out and thought it was a drone or definitely a UFO.   Still thinking about it, but it moved so quickly away once I approached it, I couldn\u2019t really process things.   Anyway, definitely saw a UFO last night and first time I have ever posted something like this.",

I noticed it when it was ~30 degrees above the horizon.  At about 40 degrees, it was blocked by clouds.

      "story": "Saw three orange orbs moving steadily, hovering, and then traveling vast distances within seconds, over Brooklyn, NY. On June 22, 2014, I was sitting on my private outdoor rooftop in Brooklyn, NY, (Williamsburg) with a friend of mine.  I watch the sky every night - I can usually find Mars if it is visible, can identify numerous constellations, know the difference between a satellite and an airplane, and just love to stare out into space.   At about 10:17 PM, I was looking at the sky as I always do, but it wasn't a very clear night and very few stars were visible due to the massive light pollution created by the New York City lights.   Out of the corner of my eye I noticed an orange glowing orb of light.  After doing a quick double-take, I saw there were actually three orbs of light moving across the sky in a way I have NEVER seen any craft or airplane or satellite move - ever.  It was completely silent and seemed to float through the air.  I instantly knew I was seeing a UFO; I had absolutely no doubt in my mind. In the midst of my excitement/awe/disbelief, I grabbed my iPhone and tried to record as much as I could (I knew that if I didn't capture this experience no one would ever believe me).  The orbs of light moved across the sky and I took my first video but to the blind eye and without the technology needed to slow down the video, all I could see was the black night sky.  I had a feeling that nothing was on that video and quickly tried to take another one before it was too late.  Fortunately,  I was able to switch the camera on in time and record what I did.  For two weeks I didn't think I had captured anythng, until I decided to watch the videos on my computer.  There is not person who I've showed this to who can come up with any plausible explanation for what I saw and recorded. The three orbs of light were moving Northeast and started very low - pretty close to some of the taller buildings.  As it moved across the sky (in a pretty slow and stable pace) it began to rise in elevation before hovering for about 20 seconds almost directly above the building across the street from me.  As it hovered there the lights remained solid and then out of nowhere the 3 lights moved rapidly throughout that area of the sky - not side to side but in terms of elevation. It was hard to determine at first whether the three orbs were all one object or if they were in fact three seperate crafts.   After watching the orbs move as they did here, both in unison and independant paths, it was clear that this was one entity.  It then descended at an extremely rapid pace and then just vanished.   I immediately fell to the ground with tears streaming out of my eyes.  I knew what I had just witnessed and was overwhlem with shock, happiness, confimation, fear, confusion, etc.  I've always known that other life existed and that UFOs regularly visit the Earth, but I never in a million years thought I would be lucky enough to witness such an encounter, let alone capture it on video.",

They were just red bright looked like a ball of lava.   We opened the windows and did not see any fire or damage.  There wasn't even a sound made when the fireballs landed or appeared to land.   I was hoping someone else outside of us on the street saw it I even yelled to get attention but the streets were vacant.   They were bright red and the funny part is my friend has saw these fireballs land two times prior and I joked about it, until I witnessed it myself.   I've been trying to make sense of it for two years.  After a lot of research, I know what I witness was something of demonic/alien.

Way, and I was looking out from my mother's window looking up in the sky to notice this big bright light of a space craft rotating itself to a different shape.  Then it went in the area of Henry Hudson Pk. Way.  I notice an air plane was passing by this unusual spacecraft that's when the space craft was shooting some kind of light at it that the air plane was struggling in flying a head and it was a stand still in the air as if this object was trying to duck the airplane to get into this object.  Then when another airplane flew near the both of them that's when that airplane was about to disappeared was lucky to break through this force.  I thanked God that the airplane was freed from this unknown object in the air.  I wish for someone to come to where I am and you will get to see what goes on here.  I am not joking and this is not a hoax neither.  I am more convinced that the little air crafts that are shape like Diamonds have landed on my roof.  I heard all kinds of weird sounds as if someone is using an electric saw or something to slice meat.   At 23:00 I notice the many little Diamond shape crafts that surround my home as if I was their prisoner . I hear all kinds of sounds in the Attic.  I hear  singing of some dong as if they were going to Kill someone.  I believe its called a say sons. When I lay down on my bed I feel a burnt pain  on my foot and to notice i see a beam of yellow light hitting my feet. I yelled out loud to stop it that they are hurting me.  Then i dont hear any sounds and dont see any beam of light flashing down on my feet.  About five mins. later they do it again with them using their beam of light on me.  I dont know what they are going to do with me either kill me or have me converted to be like them. I know what I am writing to you may sound that its off the wall but its the Gods Truth.  I have filled out more than one of these forms and no one has made the effort to come out to where I am to investigate this.

I pulled out my phone and took 3 pictures while driving on the Henry Hudson Parkway going northbound [hard to do driving 50mph].   Orbs were approx. 90 ~ 100 ft. above Hudson River at a distance from my vehicle of about 2 city blocks when first spotted.  Orbs were traveling southbound @ perhaps 40mph?  Second glance I saw the second orb trailing behind the first [probably 30 ft. distance] and also descending and getting closer to the River.  This time I tried to figure out their sizes but couldn't really determine it so I guessed that the circumference was about the length of my car [15 ft.?] They continued on their southern path at the same speed. I slowed down my vehicle to try to get a 3rd and a better look [some Brokeback mountain guy in his Lego set Toyota was honking his horn behind me until he saw me pointing out my window and at the object.  I saw his jaw drop and his eyes open via my rear view as he saw the orbs]  I ignored the driver behind me and looked to see that both orbs came to a complete stop in unison for about 5 or 6 seconds, then they continued to move southbound at the same speed I mentioned previously.  I lost sight of them as I continued to travel northbound. Both orbs were a steady bright luminescent orange with a slightly yellow tinted center [took a better look when they stopped].  I couldn\u2019t hear any sounds as the orbs flew by due to a commercial plane flying overhead and there was a good amount of cars on both sides cancelling out all other noises.    At first I may have assumed they were military drones but I couldn\u2019t find any reason to that [if military then why orange orbs?] especially when they completely stopped in mid-flight for more than a few seconds and then both continued their flight at the same time.   As I approached the George Washington Bridge I noticed several helicopters flying around and what seemed like 2 military jets circling the area as if they were searching for something.  This was really strange.   The 2 orbs were definitely UFO's [not saying a spaceship carrying aliens from another planet as many people ALWAYS assume that about UFO's]  I couldn\u2019t stop talking about it at work while people are staring at me listening to the story like I\u2019m crazy.  I quickly lessen their skepticism after showing the photos.   I searched Google Images and YouTube and found that these Orange Orbs are a very common sighting especially around the Hudson River from Manhattan all the way up north as far as Albany.  I guess it was my turn to see them...",

I don't recollect what happened to the second glowing orb, but the second I followed from the ground, darting around in the sky. I then took out my smart phone to take pictures.  This one light first hovered in front of  a 24th story window.  It then shot around to the side of the building and hovered above the building motionless as if it recognized that I was taking a picture of it.  Also at this time the \"glowing cloud\" took on a sphere shape with the sun directly behind it.  It stood out because the sky was clear save for this one \"cloud.\"  As it became spherical, it hovered very close to the roof of this 26 story building; with parts of this cloud obfuscated part of the railing alongside the roof.

It had a disco color shape to it and as I zoomed in with my video camera, it appeared as it was morphing, almost as if it was a disco heart pumping.

So I started watching the the third one as to see if it was following the the first two and as I watched them they started to kind of disapear!  My back facing where they came from I turned around and observed another coming my way from the same direction! I had to take my phone out to record this!!!   Next thing you know, one after another flying in the same direction started popping up!  I couldn't get a good view of them with my phone so I stopped recording to use a app I had on my phone!  It's like a binoculars app.  I took some pretty good pictures and then proceeded to film again!   At that time a young lady with what I guess was her father asked what was going on.  As they looked up they were amazed as well!  The father suggested I call the cops, as by that time, about fifteen passed us all going in the same direction.   So, I proceeded to walk home, while filming as much as I can.  There wasn't many people in the street, and the few that were around weren't paying us attention.

I looked up at the men, since they were at the very top, and saw something that caught my eye.  At first, thinking that this was just an aluminum balloon,  That object was sturdy, still, and in the clear sky.  Light flashing out of the object, but this wasn't an ordinary light.  It very bright, and soon, the light started to pulse.  Following after that, it changed shape. Originally shaped like a triangle, and each light was on its coordinated areas.  Followed up by a square, and lastly a circle.   At this point, I called my daughter, because i feared that I was looking at a hallucination.  Thankfully, I wasn't the only witness.  She saw this object too, and we were freaking out at this point.  Watching, talking, and staring at what possible movements this could have done.   It then, started to move very slowly, stopped, gained speed and disappeared.  My daughter even ran outside to check our backyard, to see if it might've been there.  However, it just completely disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to contact the source of this report via telephone, but were unsuccessful.

      "story": "Oval shaped solid object non illuminated hovering motionless approximately 2000 ft over the East River of Manhattan, NYC. I am 57 years old and a paralegal for an investment advisor firm in New York City.  I live in a studio apt on the top floor of a 4th Floor walk-up in the Kip\u2019s Bay area on the East Side of Manhattan.  There is a balcony in the back of the apt that has a view facing the skyline looking out over the East River towards Queens and Brooklyn.   I often go out to the balcony on warm clear nights to look at the stars and get some fresh air.  I went out 2 nights ago, on June 21st, around midnight, when I spotted a strange object hovering over the East River.  It looked like a roundish, oval shape that was not illuminated except for the city lights shining up on it and the nearly full moon behind it.  It looked to be about  1/5th  the size of a normal full moon from where I was standing which was about 5 blocks from the East River.  The altitude was higher than the Empire State Building which stands west of my vantage point.  It looked to be at least as big as a house in my estimation. \tIt was a clear night with just a few small puffy clouds still hanging in the sky near the object and I thought that maybe the object was just a small portion of a cloud but there was a breeze blowing North and the other clouds soon blew past the object and dissipated while the object remained in the same spot and hovered completely motionless.  At this point I thought I might have something out of the ordinary here so I ran back into my apartment and got my binoculars.  I steadied the binoculars against a balcony railing and managed to capture the object in my sights.  It looked oval shaped and had sort of a greenish, grayish color.  I could not discern any details such as windows or defining structure because it was difficult to keep in focus.  I thought I may have seen a few tiny pinpoint size colored lights but cannot be certain. \tAfter a few moments it began to slowly move north towards upper Manhattan and I could see stars passing behind it as it moved.  I could not hear any sound coming from it.  After moving north for a few hundred yards it changed direction and started heading due East over Long Island City in Queens.  I lost sight of it after a very tall tree in a neighboring yard blocked my view.  I waited for a half an hour to see if it would return but it never did.  The full sighting lasted about 8 mins.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 23, 2016",

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello again, Mr. Davenport!  The precise date was last Saturday, July 16 2016.  I cannot be too precise about the time ... it was between 10:00PM and 11PM. For certain it was not after 11PM (I was on the balcony with my father during the sighting, then he left to watch the 11 local news).  That Saturday, I helped my sister packing (she's moving to her new house), and I was very tired.  I didn't come home from my sister before 9-9:30PM so the time I went out on the balcony must have been between 10:30PM and 11PM.    I forgot to mention that the spheres were quite big (my father was able to see them, his vision isn't too good).  Bigger than, let's say, the lights attached to the wings of an airplane. Their size, color and movement had caught my eye. Since that evening I searched the net to see if other people have had similar sightings (red spheres).  I found a couple of video clips, with different dates and locations, only in them the spheres were blinking.  I didn't know about this kind of spheres before I am familiar with the UFO  phenomenon, actually, I had had another sighting many years ago, not in the States.  Mr. Davenport, if you want the exact location/position of the sighting, I can give you my home address.  With Google Earth you can access my street, which has at one end the highway wall (the sighting was above the wall, the spheres appeared from behind the wall, then disappeared only to reappear again, a couple of times).  I hope this helps.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

I have been using meditative techniques I learned from Dr. Steven Greer's CE5 initiative and applied it to my own practice.  I've been witnessing many orb like UFO sightings during these meditations and have been able to document lots of high strangeness.  There are far too many experiences and incidents to paint the clearest picture of what is happening in just one report, which is why I felt confused about how to report such a long timeline of events.  Despite all these antidotal words, I have documented what I could via my YouTube channel.  It's very basic, no music, no graphics, and all short and to the point.  It's hard to pick out the best video, but I am posting 2 links here, with the first video being the date and time linked to this report.  As I said, my channel is quite simple and you're more than welcomed to see the rest of my videos at your leisure to help understand how frequent it is.  Most sightings, including the one from this report are from my high rise apartment looking out toward midtown Manhattan.  There's telepathy involved in this experience as well as other phenomena that I don't think is productive going into in a format like this. https://youtu.be/rRzSxESV608  https://youtu.be/cRDKX190ZdM",

We were observing everything in the sky as usual.  For some reason this night we noticed more airplane activity than usual.  i kept noticing to the right of me there was a object in the air with red and green lights, but it was just hovering over some buildings.  it had to be at least four blocks away from us.  About ten minutes later the object dropped rapidly and then came back up, the red and green lights were still lit up on the object the whole time hovering over the same location.  my roommate and i were trying to figure out whats going on and what is it.  I thought it was a drone or something.  Around 8:45 pm we noticed a small,white, clear, rectangular shaped object gliding around the corner towards us.  As it came closer i noticed a bright light in side of the object that looked like a light bulb. it was gliding towards us slowly.  The object was actually within our reach.  The object changed its form into a golden sphere, but it looked like a cage that was shaped into a sphere.  It was still gliding towards us, the object still had the golden light inside of it.  The object flew higher and started to travel to the right of us, i caught that part on video.  The object changed its form again into some sort of mechanical ball, it then folded itself and disappeared.  My room mate started to scream dial 911, and I called channel 7 news.  I was told to send in the pictures.  I was terrified because i could not understand what was going on.  I called all my friends and family to tell them what i just witnessed.",

As the first one \"took off\" from Jersey another one was about 2 seconds behind it, and so on, until 12 lights were flying through the air. That night the moon was directly over Williamsburg and the lights were heading directly towards it, as they got there they disappeared. I was trying to figure out if it was a bunch of planes but they seemed to fly way too close together and they were disappearing - not exactly a plane behavior.

(This all happened in about 2 seconds) (Also I saw the red light but I can't remember seeing the green light at this time.)  (The red light remained level and did not teeter toter when it accelerated and decelerated.)  It then hovered for about 5 seconds (showing both red and green lights) and then slowly traveled west behind a building until I couldn't see it anymore. The whole time, this thing made no noise. I can't remember how high it hovered but I know it was close enough that if it were a drone or something, it would have made a slight noise. Besides the red and green lights and also with the darkness of the night's sky,  I couldn't make out a structure behind the lights.

I was looking further across where the cloud came from and then I saw another cloud coming that was similar to the one we had initially seen.  This cloud, however, seemed to grow in size significantly as it left our view.   At this time, I noticed a small black dot which I had first nearly disregarded as being a bird.  Upon closer inspection of it, I noticed that it had a light that blinked, which then made me think it must be a plane, but I noticed that there were no wings whatsoever, and then I saw the glint of the sun off of the right side of it revealing it as a perfect sphere.   I tried to point it out to my girlfriend, but before I could get her eyes on it it had moved behind a tree out of sight.  I have never reported nor SEEN what I believe to be a UFO and I am a Marine Corps veteran, fully aware of most aircraft that should be flying in the sky.   I hope this report can be useful to anyone else who may have seen what I saw over Brooklyn near Avenue M and Ocean Avenue is my general vantage point of the sighting. The best description of the object I can give is that it appeared dark, as it first appeared to me to be a black dot.  It was metallic in nature because I saw that it had a metallic type reflection, once the sun glinted off of it.  It was perfectly spherical and had a white blinking light that went off periodically with absolutely zero sound accompanying it.  It was not very flashy at all very basic seeming.   The most bizarre thing to me was that I think it may have been generating its own form of cloud cover, as the clouds that were very nearby it seemed to be growing in size in a very unnatural seeming way that I had never witnessed before.  I was unfortunately unable to grab my camera in the timeframe of the sighting due to it only being visible from where I was for a very short period of time, I didn't even have enough time to get my girlfriend's eyes on it before it moved out of sight.",

As it flew over us, we didn't hear anything, which is unusual.  I often hear planes flying over my house, but it was quiet.  It wasn't in the shape of any plane I've ever seen--it was a V, like a flying triangle.  Both objects slowly passed over us, and slowly flew on. I don't know what it was, but it was creepy.

      "story": "Possible NYC UFO Upper West Side, two sightings separated by four hours At around 14:30 I saw a silver object that looked like a balloon.  It floated West, across Amsterdam Avenue and about 65th Street in NYC.  It floated in the West/North West direction, out towards the Hudson River. At around 18:31 pm I was walking South on Riverside Drive, at around 71st Street, when I noticed a group of these same \u201cballoons\u201d floating West towards the Hudson River.  They looked like balloons, but they also looked like UFOs.  They were coming from a completely different direction and time than the one I had previously seen. There were approximately four UFOs in this small group.  As they ascended, they all moved at the same speed towards the sun, making it hard to see them.  One of the objects didn\u2019t float in formation.  It proceeded to move swiftly, heading North, before banking and heading South, now above the Hudson River.  It did this a few times, changing direction smoothly.  At the same time, it seemed to move in the general direction of the other objects. If they were a lot closer, I imagine they would have been relatively large balloons. The objects were silver, and, if they WERE aircraft, I imagine they were small\u2026smaller than a car.  If they were balloons, they were large balloons. The part that REALLY drew my attention was the time difference between the two sightings.  There is no way that the one balloon I saw, descended to the earth, found three more balloons like it, then proceeded to ascend back on its course, four hours after the first sighting. Maybe there was an event in NYC, where a lot of silver balloons were let off\u2026it was strange.  I have some video of the two events. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.  PD))",

      "story": "Red light hovering and flashing. This morning, around 1:30AM, I was laying my bed and playing on my phone.  Every night I hear an airplane like turbulence noise.  Usually I think nothing of it, but this morning the noise sounded so close that it caused my bed and walls to move and my ears feel like they would pop.  The sound zooms over my house, so I get up to look out the window.  I see a red light (shown in the video I Emailed).  It moves slowly toward East and stays there for a good 30 min.  Then moves back North and stays.  It starts to flash a light towards the ground. It does that twice, almost like in a circle.  Then the third time it flashes at my window.  I freak out and decide to go back to bed (my cat in my bed also was scared. She started to meow weirdly, like she does when begging for water, but she didn\u2019t move to drink). I\u2019m not sure when the light stopped shining because I fell asleep.  I didn't want to tell anyone, because I thought maybe it was a helicopter possibly looking for someo! ne.  Then in the morning my four year old sister, getting ready for school, tells my mom that someone was knocking on the window last night and she was scared to leave her bed to wake my mom.  My mom thinks nothing of it.  I show my mom the video and she tells me what my little sister told her.   At first I thought maybe it was me she heard because I was by the window to film.  When my sister leaves school, I ask her a few questions (I Obviously didnt tell her that it may be aliens because she would never sleep again).  We ask if it was a bang or a knock.  She said it was a Continuous knock that caused her to wake up.  We asked what window and she said the one by her bed, NOT the one I was recording out of.  My mom then asked if she saw anything, and she said she saw a person with no hair.  I asked if it was fat and she said no, that he was very skinny.  I don\u2019t know how reliable a four year olds word is, but I got chills.",

On the 19th of October at around 4.08 pm, we were at the 9/11 memorial taking photos of the new tower.  A couple of weeks earlier, whilst watching the pictures that I took on my phone during my holiday, I noticed an odd shaped blue object sitting next to the One World Trade Center tower.  I first thought that it was just an optical effect due to the reflection of the sunlight on my camera lens.  Then I remembered that my girlfriend was also taking photos with her phone of the same tower at the same time. I took her phone and looked closely at her pictures and unsurprisingly, the same object is on 2 other photos taken with her phone.  However, it seems having a slightly different shape on the pictures that she took compared to mine. I'm not sure how long this object was sitting there for as we did not see it on the spot but it is likely to have appeared/disappeared very quickly.  We have several pi! ctures of the same tower but the object only appears on 3 of them.  So we estimate that it was present for a very short time (no more than a few seconds).",

The dog had not made a sound the entire evening.  There was no barking, no ruffling of the bushes, or anything of the sort.   Immediately after the flash and ruffle of the trees, the dog barked once. I looked out of the window to see if I would see a shadow in the little lighting in my backyard.  But I saw nothing in the 5 minutes I waited to see something move.  But the dog never made a peep the time I was looking down from the 5th floor.  I was, periodically, whistling for the dog to make a noise.  But it never happened.  It just seeemed very strange to me.  That flash has never happened in my backyard.  Plus, the ruffling of the tree was eerie.

It was trailing the plane at the same distance (which was very close to begin with) for approximately 20 seconds.   It then began getting closer to the airplane, until it looked like it was within several feet of the tail section, and it remained there for the remainder of the sighting, which lasted only a couple of minutes.   The direction of flight was Northwest and it would have flown right over JFK airport before we witnessed it.  This was a very clear and bright morning.  How is it that nobody else saw this?  I have never seen anything like this.  I just can\u2019t get it out of my head.   This object had no wings.  It was a grey metallic object  (same color as the plane).

      "story": "Group of about 7 UFO's, with a leader to the side, and a cluster to its north. I went to take a rest from the flea market, and was shaded by a large bush.  I laid flat on the grass and had amber driving glasses on, in addition to my myopia lenses.  I was looking straight up to the zenith, watching airplanes from LGA airport, etc..  The sun was almost but not quite overhead, and shaded by a leafy branch, so I was able to gaze into the blue without the sun against me.  The clouds were minimal and there was a slight haze and I had a little coffee to drink and was relaxing.   Slowly, but suddenly, like a ghost appearing, there was a distant craft proceeding westward and slightly northward at an angle, slowly creeping.  It had a distinct boxy appearance almost like it had \"solar panels\" on both sides, and there was a faint blinking sidelight hard to make out because of the bright conditions.  It was at the limits of my visual acuity to make out any detail, but it was optical in nature as I was able to play with the image using my fingers in a triangle pinhole lens and saw it refract.   Soon after this, to my right (north), a group of approximately 5 (or more) of the same \"craft\" appeared in a rough and slowly jiggling polygon along with an extra slightly off to one side (\"apple\").  This cluster slowly appeared out of nothing, and they too had faint blinking lights.  There was no entry direction, and were ghostly in appearing.  It stayed like this for about 2 minutes and then as if on cue, all of them slowly faded back into nothingness without any abrupt motions.  The lone craft from the beginning was proceeding in its same linear direction and still visible, and then that, too, slowly disappeared in a ghostly fashion.   At the end of this, I checked the sky without the amber lenses and saw that the area where there was the cluster of the craft was blue without clouds and only some haze as it was a hot day.   The lone craft was in an area of very thin cloud.  They did not act like drones and there were too many of them, and they just appeared and disappeared.  They did not get bigger or smaller; there was no noise and they all looked the same.   I had thoughts of some kind of refraction from a remote area, but the behavior and the coincidences of this happening don't seem to fit as being manmade, which is why I make this report to you.",

Night fishing out of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and the boat goes out to the Breezy Point, Atlantic side of the beach.  2 hours out and I happen to look up and see a rectangular light facing north.  It caught my attention because this light was very long and bright.  Airliners have small round beams of light this was huge.   The strangest thing is that it was a clear night and the stars were visible behind, through and around the object.  Visible to the point that an object emitting this kind of light would have been seen, blocked out some of the stars, made some sort of noise but you could not see or hear anything.   All I saw was the light facing away from the boat towards shore or north and the stars shining through it, whatever it was.  I cannot state in detail the size of this object or compare it to anything I have ever seen.  A cloud of smoke started to cover the light completely and in seconds it was gone.  No noise, no sound, nothing obscuring the stars.   I will wait for your response and do not patronize what I saw.  This was not ours.

My husband saw a glowing orange sphere travel east to west outside our large factory window.  He told me to come see what he thought was a \u201chelicopter on fire.\u201d  The object was large, at least the size of a helicopter.  Planes coming and leaving La Guardia airport continued to fly in their usual paths.  They were distinguishable as planes. This object was indistinguishable.  It did not sparkle, but its colors shined with a twinkling quality, and its colors of orange and red rotated or mixed like lava.  It hovered as I approached the window and stayed completely stationary for about three minutes above buildings at about half a mile away.  It was soundless.  My husband said the sphere appeared to be dropping debris.  He saw glowing, orange debris drop four or five times.  I saw it drop debris the last instance.  The debris appeared to be liquid, like molten lava.  It dropped about 20-30 feet and disappeared. The orange and red sphere was only a sphere.  No tail, blade, or landing skids could be seen, which would have been illuminated had it been some kind of aircraft on fire.  At this point, my husband began taking a video with his iPhone. I became very alarmed, thinking, if it were a helicopter, it would be going down, without question, because for that much debris to fall, the interior of the helicopter would have to be completely aflame.  But there was no smoke and no actual flames.  Just the look of something hot and burning, which grew slightly in intensity.  The sphere seemed more to be emitting light than on fire.  Finally, the sphere started flying upwards.  We watched it ascend at a slight angle east another two minutes before it disappeared into far up into space traveling about as fast as a plane, but at an altitude much higher than we have seen planes fly.",

      "story": "Unknown object over Upper West Side NYC Sunday the 16th of September, 2018, around 6:05 PM, with a clear blue sky and no clouds around in New York City, my wife and kids were walking North on Broadway on our way home.  She was a few yards ahead of me with our youngest and I was walking behind with our 15 year old.   Around 89th St. and Broadway I noticed a reflection high in the sky, maybe a circular shape but not sure.  I\u2019m not sure if it was a light or if it was a reflection from the sun on the object because the view was coming in and out as it was moving north the same way we were walking.  My 15 year old also took notice and he grabbed my phone and took a short video. The video captures a bright object but it was too high to tell what it was.  It wasn\u2019t an airplane because we saw airplanes flying around and we see them all the time.  They always fly at a low level because they follow the same pattern into LaGuardia.  We also see the pattern of airplanes flying into Newark Airport.   It wasn\u2019t a helicopter because it was way too high.  It wasn\u2019t a balloon because the movement wasn\u2019t scattered the way a balloon moves with the wind and the wind at that time \u201cI checked\u201d was blowing SE at 8.1mph.  This unknown object was moving slowly north then it slowly tuned towards the west heading towards the Hudson River that separates New Jersey and New York.  Eventually we lost sight of the object because of the buildings.  I\u2019m writing here just in case someone also saw something, same date and time.   If you want to ask me questions you may call me but what I wrote here is pretty much what I saw.  I will see how I can send the video.",

      "story": "Bright Red Lights Over Manhattan. June 22, 2018, my wife and I had an after-dinner stroll along the promenade in Long Island City, New York.  We took a seat somewhere between Long Island City and Hunter\u2019s Point Ferry landings to rest and enjoy the view of Manhattan on the other side of the East River.  At 8:30, or so, we spotted an object with a pair of red lights hovering above the skyline.  The lights were a little too bright for me not to think it was odd.  I joked that it was a UFO, without really putting too much stock in it.  Still, there was something so strange about its brightness and its steadiness, like a snapshot in the sky, that I could not take my eyes off of it. The object made a vertical jump, held for a second, and then shot across the sky 3 to 5 miles toward the southern part of Manhattan in about 2 seconds, and that was when my jaw hit the ground.  From where we sat, neither of us could determine the exact height of the object but it appeared higher than the Chrysler Building - a lot higher.  My wife argues that it was probably a trick of the eye and that whatever we saw was in reality closer to us.  She believes it flew lower and above the river\u2019s edge.  I disagree.  I trust my sense of perspective.  I can compare structural sizes and their spacial relationships as good as anyone.  I can tell the difference between far and near, high and low, and I am convinced that what I saw was way up in the sky and away from the river\u2019s edge!  My wife said it was a helicopter. But after a real helicopter flew by, she clearly saw the difference.  The helicopter\u2019s lights were not as bright as the UFO\u2019s.  The helicopter was noisy.  The UFO was silent.  The helicopter wavered as it hovered.  The UFO was as still as a statue.  She said then it was probably a drone. I countered with the following: a drone has height restrictions. Again, the height and distance of what we saw could be argued, but you\u2019ll never change my opinion. The UFO was at least a few thousand feet over the skyline and further west of the East River. After YouTubing videos of drone in flight at night, I can say that the behavior of a drone compared to that of the UFO is much different too. Like helicopters, drones are subject to air buffeting. They\u2019re not perfectly steady. Their movements are not clean, sharp, symmetrically perfect like what I saw in the UFO. Describing the UFO\u2019s movement was like someone using a right-angle straight edge on a laser pointer. It moved in two perfect straight lines, cutting over abruptly in a 90 degree angle. Also, like anything else in movement, drones display acceleration. The thing my wife and I saw did not show this. One moment it was there, the next it\u2019s shooting across the sky. No acceleratio! n! It was amazing. One more thing: I don\u2019t think the NYPD would allow anyone to fly a drone in an area crowded with helicopter traffic. Just saying.  I wish I had recorded it, but I didn't really expect anything odd to happen. When it did, it happened too fast.",

I was sitting on my apartment patio in Riverdale section of the Bronx  when two joined red lights appeared. They sometimes flashed.  At times they seemed to merge into one red light. The light/craft sometimes hovered, sometimes flew without sound in and out of my sight.   I called my wife out to see.  We sat and watched it soundlessly zoom, without sound, then stop.  Sometimes a green light flashed as well. The light/craft (I couldn't make out a shape) seemed to be having fun in the skies.  Very fast.  Finally, it quickly descended in a fast, straight drop, our view blocked by nearby trees.   We thought it might be drone, but we don't know if drones are capable of such far-ranging manouvers or coming to an abrupt stop and hovering.",
