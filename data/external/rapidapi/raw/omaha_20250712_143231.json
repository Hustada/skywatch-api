I wa the only witness as far as i know I was in labor with my youngest child he was bor at 4:20 the following morning there were tornado warnings and a large thunderstorm in the area at the time I was looking out the window to try and relax and i saw it .  I didnt say anything at the time because i thought it was the drugs I was on but I found out later that they had given me drugs at least 3 times and. after the event it was as if my body was rejecting them I could feel all the pain of my labor and the hospital still doesnt know why .  the nurse said they had given me enough drugs to put me to sleep or enough so that i wouldnt be able to walk for at least a week. I asked my boyfriend at the time if he could see it to and he didnt even look they just closed the blinds. but before they could i saw a lighting strick just bounce off it and hit a light pole.",

I could see people standing outside and other people slowing down, almost to a complete stop just to look at it.  It had 3 lights on it, and all were at the front of the aircraft. The colors were red and a bright floressant white color.  The aircraft it self was probably about 35-45 ft. in width, and to be honest, I really can't tell what color it was. The color of it was almost midnight or camoflauge.",

      "story": "Troubles With Unexplained Laser Beams My wife and I have been seeing during the day a few strange oval shaped type craft above our home, they appear to be using the Sun as a form of absorption if that makes any sense whatsoever.  We have called numerous individuals as well as several agencies without any help in return. During the day they appear on film and we have them recorded, yet to the plain ordinary eye they are not visible. When my wife and I first seen them we were filming our 6 year old son flying his kite when we first noticed them.  The same evening when this first occurred we had an experience that is still ongoing. At first we assumed that a child had a laser pointer, we seen a red laser enter into our master bedroom and literally bounced off our walls, our 6 year old son yelled at the same time and had the same red beam of light in his bedroom and that evening needless to say he slept with us.  We cannot explain this without coming across as insane, yet we are getting no help in regards to whom we have currently contacted. We now see these red beams during the day in our home and after trying to record them on film they disappear. Our son is petrified due to he stated that these red beams were talking to him and after we asked him what he meant he stated they were spelling out words as well as language to him.  I will not go into any detail as to what these beams have spelled out, we are in fear that it will get worse if even possible at this point in time. They claim to not be from Earth, furthermore they claim to do us harm.  We are at a dead end and ready to move and we are searching for anyone else in or around the Omaha area who has witnessed anything similar. These beams have been everywhere in our home and the troubling thing is what they spell out.  Again, in closing,  we only hope someone here might have had any similar problems with these types of beams and what have you done to stop them? We are one step away from moving. The language they have expressed through writing for a better word has been anything but friendly.  When these beams enter our home our 6 year old son knows right away, directly above our home we hear a very loud humming, almost a whirling sound.",

      "story": "U.F.O hovering over trees in Nebraska I was 13 years old when I had my one and only true U.F.O sighting/experience. It was around 10:30pm when my mother, brother and I had just gotten home from an event. We lived on a horse shoe street which was somewhat surrounded by tall trees (50 feet plus). We had just pulled in the drive way and as we were getting out of the car my mother says \"What is that?\" and as plain as day hovering about these tall trees was a U.F.O. My brother says that\u2019s a flying saucer. There is no doubt to what we are seeing. This is visible no more than 200 feet away. This saucer length had to be at least 6-8 maybe more diesels long all lined up together. I was amazed at what I was seeing. I just could not believe my own eyes. This saucer hovered over these trees for 5-10min. It had several white lights around the outer part. After 5-10min it began to rise slowly and I mean slowly and with in a few seconds it took off at an angle leaving just a tracer of its path and it was gone. I can close my eyes today and see it all over. I will NEVER forget. I look to the sky all the time hoping to see one again.  Also, I myself have experience what I believe was an alien encounter. I believe this occurred after the sighting not sure of the date/time but there was light outside. I was sitting in my bed reading a book and my back is to the bed room entrance. So, I\u2019m reading and I feel 3 taps on my left shoulder and mentally I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s my brother and as I turn and look over my shoulder I see a white figure with an oval shaped head and black oval eyes and I freaked out . I jumped up and ran out of my house. I\u2019ve seen this figure described on television by other people whom have claimed of seeing aliens but some people say its grey or some color but what I saw was white. It freaks me out to even think about it. I believe there are chosen people to see the things we see and I feel bad for the people that will never truly believe and know that we are not alone.

This object had no tail or contrail and was moving way to quickly to be an aircraft in a tower controlled airspace (TCA). I saw none of the red or green lights associated with conventional aircraft either. The object appeared to fly over the interstate then pitched up a bit before it went completely dark. I raced home and checked the Heavens-above website for any satellite or ISS overflights of the area at that time. I could find nothing flying over Omaha for that time period. I was able to see the ISS flying overhead at about 7:40pm on Saturday night October 6th. It was not anywhere near as bright nor was it moving as fast as the object I had seen the night before. I reported the friday night sighting to a friend who is a MUFON investigator and he suggested I also send a report to this website.",

      "story": "White light flies over Omaha Monday (9/04/06) evening I had stepped into my brothers backyard with his 18 month old daughter in my arms.  It was dark and the moon was high and to the left as I faced south.   As soon as I stepped out of the house, the first thing I saw was not the moon, but a very bright, fast moving, white light in the sky.  It was as bright as the moon and at first I thought it was the police helicopter with it's searchlight on.   It took only seconds for me to realize that was not what I was seeing.  My niece, whom I do not count as a witness due to her age, could not stop pointing at it.   Once I realized this was no ordinary craft, I yelled in the house for my brother to come out and see it.  In doing so, I alerted the entire house.  In all, 4 adults, an eleven year old, and my 18 month old niece all saw the phenomena.   The light moved across the sky from west to east.  It moved in a fairly quick, yet consistent speed.  It only varied course slightly when it appeared to be manuevering to it's left and right.   In all, the light was visible for about 1 minute.  At it's end, it disolved into the distance.   We then stayed outside for about half an hour to \"star gaze\".  In that half an hour we saw several commercial flights at various elevations, a satellite in orbit, and the police helicopter did fly over (without searchlight)and was obvious to us that if the helicopter did fly over we would have definately heard it.   Ruling those things out, we came to two possibile conclussions; 1 )it was an outer worldly craft, 2) being that we live in Omaha, we are accustomed to seeing craft from the S.A.C. airforce base (B-2 Steaths, fighter jets, etc...).  However, this craft made no banking turn to where the base would be located and seemed to dissapear once it passed the moon.   We are fairly certain that this was no government aircraft and are just curious to see if you have heard of any similar reportings in this area.   This was my second personal encounter, the first took place in 1990 and was no where near as i! mpressive.   Thank you for your time.",

      "story": "white flashes and red laser beams We were at the time a new family to Sarpy county, my job had brought my family to Sarpy County and following what now has occurred, needless to say we are heading back to Missouri.  One evening my wife witnessed something of what appeared to be at the time white flashes in our bedroom that was coming through our window. These bright white flashes were continual and only appeared in the early hours of morning.  After the third day of this going on we had contacted our neighbor and asked him if he had seen any unusual white flashes in the early morning hours and he looked at us like we were insane.  My wife including our three children ended up sleeping together until we found out what these white flashes were, only problem is other things started happening. Around two and three in the early morning hours we started hearing a low hum similar to a vibration, so I took my ladder out and climbed up on our roof and seen no cable interruption. In my line of work I work for an electrical company but I will not mention which one out of the fear of possible retaliation.  My wife as well as my eldest child felt our home was haunted but something kept telling me differently, for example one evening we heard such a loud noise like a jet blast but throughout the entire sky and to this day I have never heard such a loud noise and hopefully we never will again.  These white flashes seemed to subside to only then be replaced by what appeared to be a red laser type of beam. This beam for a better word would spell out threats on our bedroom wall as well as through our house, again emphasizing that my wife said our home was haunted.  Then it happened, one evening the threats started getting worse and we started to see a few circular objects in the Southern sky and after contacting more than just a few local officials, for the most part each one felt we had lost our minds.  They and by they I am referring to whoever or whatever was using these red beams started writing on our walls information that no one had any access to and it started to cause a very prominent divide in our family.  Some of the words that to this day still standout were such words as die, filthy, leave,  you cannot make us leave, Norma [my wife felt maybe a correlation to Marilyn Monroe?], they whoever they are mentioned they still are visiting others who they have talked to before and they wanted me to go public which I refused and that seemed to anger them worse.  This red beam went as far as naming each member of our family and each evening it grown worse. The writing started lasting later into the morning and longer, personally I started losing more sleep as each day passed until finally we had enough and we now are staying with friends until we move back to Missouri where my wife has family.  When this red beam was writing, it would also make direct contact to my wife on her body including myself and we could feel heat from it. After it started leaving marks on my wife in the form of small burns around her head, neck, ears, and along her legs. That is when we moved to a friends home that I met after moving to Sarpy county.  I want to tell anyone who may be reading this that I am an electrician by trade and in no way shape or form have I in my entire life ever have dealt with anything like this and to those others who these things refer to, my family who are dealing with this, our heart goes out to you.  To all the officials we contacted I would like to end this by saying thank you for nothing.",

The object was a small silver ball about the size of a mini basket ball.  It appeared to be hovering about 1 to 2 feet off the ground from the angle I was looking at it.  The first thing that came to mind was that I was seeing stuff. As I had just woke up for work about 45 min ago. I just sat there looking at it for about 30-40 seconds or so trying to refocus on it thinking that my eyes were playing tricks on me.  Soon I thought what the hell is that, and started walking up the street.  As I was walking up the street I thought that it could be a small Mylar balloon.  But then I thought that a balloon would be moving and this thing was sitting still.  As I got about 30 or so feet from it.  It shot strait up so fast that it looked like it was fired out of a gun. It went out of sight with in 1-2 seconds.   It never made any noise, and had no lights; it was just a metallic ball. It really kind a freaked me out.  This is the first time that I have ever seen something that I could not explain.  I am still kind of confused.  I am dead set that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.   I was telling one of my employees about this morning and he said that I should report it.  I had no idea who I should report it to.  So after a Google search I found this site.

When we (2 adults) turned to look at where they were pointing (to the east) we saw a fairly large, brightly lit \u201cflying craft\u201d in the sky just above the treetops and houses moving towards us.  I first assumed it was a prop plane flying low, but immediately realized it was not the shape of an airplane (or firework or comet or military plane, etc). It was a boxy-circular shape (somewhat trapezoidal at first), very brightly lit with an orange-yellow light.  The entire craft was covered with a haze that seemed to diffuse the perimeter edges, which is why I can\u2019t put a name to the shape.    There was a brighter spot of light in the center of the object. It was moving towards the park clearing, but when the kids started shouting and pointing the craft stopped moving forward and began to hover.  It hovered for several seconds, and then began moving back \u2013 to the east \u2013 in the direction that it was originally coming from.  As it got smaller it seemed to change into an elongated oval, then in an instant it was just gone!  Two of the children said it was as if when they started pointing and shouting, the craft \u201cnoticed them\u201d and stopped moving towards us.    It was pretty close to us, but there was no noise.  It was totally silent.  In all, we watched it for approximately 20 seconds.  The children saw it for about 5 seconds longer because they saw it first.",

The sky was very clear, almost cloudless, and I distinctly saw a white shape, which I first believed to be a normal commercial airplane, traveling west. After further inspection I realized that the object did not resemble any airplane I had seen before, as it had no markings on it. It also didn't have any distinct shading, by that I mean to say that I could not concretely identify any appendages that would normally be visible, such as the wings. It was also traveling at a higher speed than a plane like that normally seems to move. It was quite far away, and I do not have the best eyesight. I could not hear the roar of any engine, but that is most likely due to the distance. Also, there was no cloudy trail left behind in the craft's wake. While I was still inspecting the object, keeping it in my line of sight, it vanished. I got off the loading dock so I could have a better view of sky above me and searched for the object, but I could not find it.",

My estimation is that it would have been approximately 22:00.  At the time, my family was living in the Millard community in Sarpy County, just outside of Omaha, Nebraska. On the evening of the event, my brother and I had been allowed to stay up late, as we were waiting for our mother to return from a shopping trip.  Our house had a large picture window in the living room (facing west), and our couch was situated with its back against the window.  My brother and I had been kneeling on the couch facing backwards, allowing us to look out the picture window. After several minutes, I noticed what appeared to be a bright object in the western sky, and that it was moving east at a high rate of speed.  As the object became closer, I noticed that it was triangular shaped and silver in color.  I also noticed that there were several similar objects, traveling in single file, all flying at the same speed and in the same direction.  Each object was flipping end-over-end, at a rate of approximately 1 flip every 2 seconds. As I previously mentioned, there was cloud cover on the evening in question.  The objects were all flying below the cloud cover.  They also appeared to be maintaining a very constant altitude, despite the fact that they were flipping.  I\u2019d have estimated that the objects were flying at an altitude of approximately 2,500 feet and that they were roughly 150 feet in length. The objects were silver in color and were clearly visible, yet did not appear to have any lights.  Rather, their surfaces were simply illuminated, as if the skin of each craft was its own light source.  Their flight path took them directly over our house, so I was able to get a good look at them as they flew over.  They made no sound at all, had no obvious vapor trails or exhaust and did not flash, blink or pulse any light.  The skin, however, did appear to \"shimmer.\"  The best description I could offer for this \"shimmering\" would be to take a very reflective piece of foil, crumple it into a ball, unfold and flatten the foil, then shine a flashlight at the foil, moving the light quickly across the foil\u2019s surface. In total, 4 of the objects passed overhead, at the rate of 1 every 15 seconds or so.  The total duration of the event, from our first noticing the objects to them passing over our house and out of view, was about 2 minutes.  That was the first and only time that we saw the objects.

At this point, I ran to the window and could see nothing.  The craft was across the street from my house, to the left of a small storage shed at a playground.

      "story": "Football shaped glowing orange light drifts straight across sky, west to east,  to the top of a very tall TV tower and then disappears Orange \"football\" shaped light drifts west to east across the night sky towards a TV tower. The orange light goes out when it appears to touch the top of the TV tower  Date: February or March 1969 (approximate; certainly between Feb 1 and May 1 of 1969)  Time: Near Midnight. Location; West suburbs of Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska, USA  Visibility: Very Good, crystal clear atmosphere on the ground and up to the cloud base. Overcast sky with very high ceiling providing an opaque, starless, moonless background. Situation: Omaha, Nebraska has three very tall TV transmission towers on a hill on North 72nd Street and Crown Point Drive. These towers are about 1200 feet in height from base to the top. They are situated on one of the highest hills in the Omaha area, between Military Ave. ( a north-west to south-east diagonal street) on the south,  and Crown Point Drive (an east-west running street) on the north, with North 72nd Street (a north-south running street) immediately to the east.  The towers are arranged in a more or less North - South line. They are each about 600 feet apart, so the south tower is a total of about 1200 feet from the north tower. The middle tower is offset to the east about 200 feet, though most people think the  three towers look to be in a straight north - south line with each other. Line of sight: Clear, unobstructed view. My line of sight with the towers was almost exactly 45 degrees south-west to the north-south running line up of the towers. I was almost exactly six miles due south-west from the towers. Distance: I was almost exactly six miles due south-west from the TV Towers. Size of \u201cUFO\u201d , my guess, explained below, is that the UFO was somewhere between 50 to 100 feet long. Shapw: It was shaped like an American football; strongly pointed at both ends and completely symmetrical. As it traveled the pointed ends were front and rear. It traveled in a very flat, straight horizontal line. Appearance: The UFO was shaped like an American football. It was a bright, glowing, uniform orange color; much the color of true neon light (not \u201cflorescent\u201d neon colors). It glowed steadily with no pulsation or variation in brightness or color. I was driving North on 132nd Street (a north-south running street), just north of Pacific Street (an east-west running street) traveling slightly up hill. That hill on 132nd St. crests just a few hundred yards north of the Pacific Street intersection. As I crested the rise I could clearly see the three towers as outlined by their red blinking warning lights. I was intimately familiar with this stretch of road as I grew up very near there. Again; I was driving and looking due north. I had to look to the right to see the towers as I crested the hill. I saw something I\u2019d never seen before. A small orange light the shape of an American football was slowly drifting from west to east towards the towers. The \u201cfootball\u201d was moving in a perfectly flat horizontal line and the long axis of the \u201cfootball\u201d was horizontal, like a football would be if being thrown. To me it looked just like an orange neon light in both color and the way it glowed; very fascinating and pleasant to look at, neither too bright nor too dim. I laughed as reminded me of a florescent orange Nerf Football, though it truly was illuminated. This orange glowing \u201cfootball\u201d was traveling in a perfectly flat horizontal line, and apparently from my position,  headed directly towards the top-most tip of the northern most TV tower. As there were no other cars on the road, I stopped the car and turned off the headlights leaving only the parking lights on, so as to minimize any extraneous light. I sat there watching this \u201cfootball\u201d for probably no more than 30 seconds (certainly less than a minute.) until it, apparently from my view point, drifted right up to where the leading tip of the \u201cfootball\u201d touched the top tip of the north TV tower and then it (the \u201cfootball\u201d) blinked out, went dark, never to reappear. This left no visible outline. It was as if the \u201cfootball\u201d just disappeared. I sat there for probably an additional five minutes waiting to see if the \u201cfootball\u201d would reappear, but it did not. There was NO effect to the TV towers. The red safety lights on all three towers continued to blink normally the whole time. There was NO flash when the \"football\" touched the tower. The orange glow of the \"football\" never varied, never pulsed; it simply went out when it touched the tower. I was absolutely fascinated by this and not the least bid frightened or disturbed, but then again, it appeared to be a fairly long way off from me. Now, granting that I was six miles from the TV towers and it was night, so all I could see were the blinking red safety lights on the towers and the constant orange glow of the \u201cfootball\u201d, I cannot say for certain how the \u201cfootball\u201d actually lined up with the TV towers or where it actually was physically with relation to the towers; BUT, from my vantage point it appeared that the \u201cfootball\u201d was at the very same altitude as the top of the north tower and that the \u201cfootball\u201d drifted right up to the top tip of the north tower and then went dark when it \u201ctouched\u201d the tip of the tower. Having said the above; if the \u201cfootball\u201d actually did touch the top of the tower, and then gauging its size in proportion to the tower, I would say that the horizontal length of the \u201cfootball\u201d would have been between 50 (fifty) to 100 (one hundred) feet in length.",

Since then I have constantly watched the sky with binoculars or naked eye and have seen numerous objects over the years. I dont have the best camera but decided to try and take zoomed in photos now and then of objects I have seen. The camera that took the photos in regards to this report is a Digital with zoom that uses a floppy disk for storage. I have debated wheather or not to file this report and submit the photos since I want to be absoultly sure that what is reported is accurate and not a waste of anybodys time.  The only manipulation that I have done on the photos submitted is to invert color & or zoom in & or sharpen in order to try and get the best view possible of the objects. I would love if Mufon or someone could enhance them better. This was a clear sunny day late afternoon. Sitting on my deck looking up at approximately a 60 - 80 degree angle - approximately 5 or 10 degre! es to the west of South. Offutt AFB is 10 - 15 miles to the SE. Millard Airport is 1 mile straight south. Omaha Eppley is 15 miles to the North East.  I was a jet mechanic in the Navy and am quit familiar with military and commericial aircraft. I have learned the incoming and outgoing flight paths for the above facilities.  I am guessing that the objects I observed and took photos of are approximately up around 30 - 40 thousand feet as they were hard to see with the naked eye but able to watch with binoculars and they still appeared to be distant. When I took the photos - I didnt know if the pictures would turn out or not let alone capture anything since the objects seemed so far distance.  The most common factor in the photos is the small green circular light. I first noticed the triangular object (which was hard to distinguish its shape at the time) and took its picture which I was supprised to see the triangular shape and more important to see a cicular area on the bottom o! f the craft which appears to be some sort of propulsion emissi! on. The two object photo - was one object then two, were there and then were gone. I know what I saw, I know what I took pictures of and I know what the pictures are showing; I know that the objects are not any type of commericial or military aircraft that I have ever seen before. No matter if you are a skeptic of UFO's or a believer in UFO's as I am - here are the pictures for you to view and decide for yourself what the objects are. Mufon or NuForc are encouraged by me to analyize these photos in depth because I would like to know what they decide the objects in the pictures might be.

I could not see any details on what it actually looked like as far as color because it was dark, but it had about 5-6 little white/yellow lights and one red light.  Besides the overall shape and complete lack of sound, it was the size of a large airplane and when I noticed it, it was too close not to make a sound.   The lights did not blink but did seem to turn off for a couple seconds and come back on which was also strange.  The most strange thing I noticed was the way it flew, it seemed to go side to side and up in down almost like a kite but still flew am! azingly fast.

As I was pulling in I looked up at the sky and noticed a strange light appearing out of the northwest and moving towards the south. It was quite bright and seemed to move very smoothly across the sky.  I first thought it was a plane but it seemed to have too much red and orange colors on it.  As it continued to move south , I grabbed my cell and called my neighbor and told her to come out into her front yard.  When I hung up I saw another light appear out of the Northwest and start moving in the same path as the first.  As the first moved further to the south, I was able to get a better look and it seemed it had fire coming from the bottom of it which caused the orange-ish-redish  color \u2013 above the orange it was a bright white but I couldn\u2019t really distinguish a particular shape. Then there was another light appearing out of the northwest (now 3 in total) that started following the same path as the first two \u2013 they seemed to all gather in the south hanging suspended.  I tried taking a picture with my cell phone but no luck.  My neighbor was looking as well and trying to take a picture with her cell phone.  I think there were 2 more lights appearing and moving the same direction. I then ran into the house to get my camera and by the time I got back out there, my neighbor said they were \u201call gone\u201d.  She then asked me if I had seen them form a triangle in the south but I didn\u2019t as I had run into get my camera.",

It was exactly 6:30 am on the clock in my car.   I noticed a very, very bright night kind of hovering over the sky above the house.   In perspective, it looked like it was right over the point in the attic of the house.   So I back up and as I back up, this light goes straight up vertically right over the house, moving higher into the sky.   I noticed\u2026.and stopped... When I stopped, it stopped.   Then I put the car back in drive and moved back into the driveway, the light followed and dropped back down, moving closer.   I did it again and the light followed each time. Then I started thinking, maybe it is a police helicopter of something.  So I back out again and pulled out as I normally do, still seeing this light moving with me.   I went to the end of the drive and began to pull out on to the street.  Curiousity had a hold of me at this point so I put the car in park and got out again.   The light had moved over horizontally again as if it was following me. I noticed the time was now 6:50 am, which seemed was crazy,  time just flew, I did not realize I had spent so much time watching this bright light. So I get back in the car, and drive away.    I drove 2 blocks over and 4 blocks up which took me to the stop sign at 23rd and F street.   I  put the car in park again and got out to see if I could see the light.   It was there, right above the street ,  definitely following me.   I wasn\u2019t afraid or anything, I just kept thinking, what the heck is this. So I was getting back in the car and I saw a man going to his car\u2026.I kind of waved to him and I asked him if he could see this light\u2026he kept saying no, but there is no way anyone could miss this light.   I told him to  follow the tree  line and look again.  He said no and got in his car. So I got back in my car and proceeded to work.   I work off of 120th and Maple.   When I got to work, I glanced up quickly to see if I see anything and I did not. So a few minutes later, a coworker arrived, she had picked up breakfast and her hands were full, so I went to the door to help her gather her things.   The light was there. I asked her if she could see it and she did.  She said she thought it was a black hawk helicopter  and did not seem too impressed, but by now, it was lighter outside and it did not look as spectacular  and of course she did not see it move across the sky as I did. I have no clue what this was but I asked it to make us treat each other well and the take care of the world better\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..oh and I also asked it to make me rich and skinny\u2026.just in case it was something out of the ordinary and could hear me.",

      "story": "Omaha,Nebraska eye witness sighting orange and red light that flashed white light small red lights flew over and two red lights flew I went outside my apartment building at 4 am on 6-12-2012.  I live in Omaha Nebraska.  I looked into the northwest sky and had noticed an orange and red light high in the sky. I could not tell how high in the sky it was.  It looked like it was the size of Venus when it was viewable in May 2012,  But it was too low in the sky to be Venus.  To gauge the distance I would have to say it was, at least from my perspective, least five miles northwest of my corner of 19th and Douglas st. As I looked at it it would pulse orange and red. Sometimes it would flash a bright white light.  It just hovered in the sky motionless.  After walking three blocks west on Douglas which took about 10 minutes in a casual walk, I had noticed a bright red light, a much smaller light, had flew from the south and flew in an arch over the orange and red light and I had lost track of it.  After that happened about 15 minutes later I saw two red lights flying side by side heading east.  I could hear a helicopter flying around behind me but I could not see it.  I saw the red lights that flew together as they passed over my head.  They did not blink or flash they were at a constant glow.  The red was like the color of crimson. I looked back at the red orange light in the sky still motionless.  I watched it for about 15 more minutes and there was no movement, I could still hear helicopters, but they were not close to the object as I could tell.  I walked back to my apartment, which took about 10 minutes and went to the roof of my building. There are eleven floors on my building and I went to the roof, which opens at 5am.  I went to the roof to see if I could still see this light.  It was still there.  From higher up I could see that it was far too low in the sky to be celestial.  The sun was starting to come up and it was harder to see but it was still there.  I cant quite gauge the distance from me it was, but if I may submit a photo showing the building and where it was in the sky in relation to the building it would be easier for me to explain. It slowly moved northwest and slowly disappeared from sight. Sighting ended about 5:15am on 6-12-2012",

The light then resembled a small star and did not appear to be moving. A second bright light light showed up 10 minutes later, but located more directly overhead and was constantly bright(not flashing). The second light appeared to be moving slightly in circular motions. About 10 minutes after the second light appeared, the first light that resembled a small start suddenly flew across the sky and the two lights began to move around eachother very noticeably. The two lights were far too distant to be any type of aircraft.  They resembled stars. They also changed directly rapidly and moved in circular motions.  I have not seen air planes or other flying objects move like this.  Also, the smaller light that moved across the sky, moved very quickly within a second or two. I can't imagine any object that is capable of moving this fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

He ran upstairs and we watched it together.  The red light started to dim and then slowly faded completely.We could still see the darkness of the craft,i threw open the window and could hear no motor or any type of small engine sounds coming from that area in the sky.It then slowly moved out of my line of sight and disappeared.I then ran downstairs and outside the backdoor,down on the lawn so we could! see better.  It was around 5 minutes standing outside waiting when almost ready to go inside because of biting misquitoes when another red light very similar to the first light appeared in the same area as when i saw the first one. This object looked brighter and moved very similar but the light stayed consistant this rime never fading,it was almost cigar shaped like a torch but then became smaller and more cylyndrical like a circle.We watched until it slowly and methodically disappeared westward towards the horizon.It was less than 5 minutes again when appeared in the same vacinity as the first two,a massive bright torchlike shaped cigar which was 10 times brighter than the first two.Following very close near that location was an immense bright &quot;white&quot; light from a mid-sized what appeared to be a military plane headed towards my direction,toward the military base-Offutt/Space-Strat Com. Bellevue,Nebraska.The red object then floated slowly and traveled in a similar ! pattern as the first two,it traveled this slow pattern again h! eading w estward toward the horizon.These lights seemed to be individual separate lights.Never blinking or flashing just the first mentioned which faded then re-appeared.I think it was probably a military test craft or drone,just my opinion but I wanted to make sure i wrote this report as quickly as I saw it asap.Thank you.",

I stopped on the side of the interstate threw ny hands up like what, i felt like it was a movie because there were 2 ufo's following me I sped off called my friend he said he couldn't hear me for a minute or so sped around area's with lots of trees so they couldn't follow an they disappeared by the time i went around neighborhoods. but it seemed to follow me off the interstate an when I existed it stopped following. I was in a black car. the object has never followed me in the red car, also I have seen the same thing just flying about 10,000 following firework smoke an after the boston terror thing I noticed there was a golden ball that day flashing ! from gold to red it was going up ames street west bound.If u watch the sky you see them all the time I have seen them going in every direction alot of the time they don't even stop they just fly right over my head one time we were walking an a ufo flew right over head from west to east. I can say Ive seen them go every direction. I think they watch or mess with the people who don't believe because now that I believe there's something else out there they don't bother me any more.  Oh an I was the one that said I say a ufo above the tree in the back yard I forgot to say mark that the reason I noticed the ufo was mainly because I think my dogs were barking at it or at least they were barking towards the ufo I belive the ufo's are portals that aliens can enter our world threw an or they are camera's so they can see where to block the sun but they obvious like to mess with people some times if i think about them I will see a real bright gold right on top of my neighbors house then! when I look it disapaers. I also noticed that the day all of ! the star s were falling, there were the 2 that are always there an all of the sudden both of the balls of light went the opposite direction an diapered. that same day I went out west an saw a silver ball not far off the ground flashing from silver the dark or so you couldn't see it. It was flying around then disapered. I am always watching for activity. I think I would have seen alot more but I never knew about ufo's untill 4 years ago.",

I couldn\u2019t see it with my naked eye, I had to take a picture of it to show up in the sky.   The craft looked like two spheres on top, and a figure eight design on the bottom.  The top two spheres looked like the front of a bra would and white, the bottom looked like metal.  There was a pink miasma that surrounded it but only in the picture as well.   The craft was very small, and I had to zoom in on the picture to see it clearly, but most definitely not a normal craft to see flying about.

Once we got close and I meen literally 40 to 50 feet under it I saw that the lights were attached to a black silhouette of a craft that when it passed by stars they would disappear behind the darkness of this craft, it was bigger than anything I've ever seen in the sky, once it reached crown point on 72nd all the lights disappeared at once and I could no longer see the silhouette either, but the thing is I'm surprised that it wasn't on the news or anything, there were so many people out that night, we couldn't have been the only ones who saw this.",

I am 59 years old, and a 36 year veteran Police officer in the Dallas TX. area.  In the Military in the 1970's I was in search radar, both air and surface, and am trained in aircraft recognition and performance. I work in the Dallas metro area, but live about 140 miles NE of Dallas near the small town of Omaha Tx.  My house is 8 miles from any town, and its very dark at night, the sky is alive with stars, and the Milky Way blazes across the sky at night. On the listed date and time, I walked out of my house to get something out of my car,  which was parked in front of my barn about 150 feet from my house.  As is my usual habit, I looked up at the sky.  As soon as I looked towards Polaris, I saw 3 lights traveling in a straight line formation, or follow the leader formation.  Since they were only lights, I could not tell the altitude.  From my perspective they were about half the size of a pencil eraser, and again from my perspective, they were approximately 1 foot apart from each other.  The lights were brighter than the stars and were brilliant white.  It is very quiet at my place , and I often hear airliners flying at 30+ thousand feet as they pass over my house as a low roar.  These lights produced no sound at all that I could hear. I cannot estimate the speed at which the lights were traveling since I don't have an altitude to base it on.  However they traversed the sky from North to South till out of sight in about 15 seconds. I don't believe these were satellites.  I know what objects in orbit look like as they pass overhead.  These lights were traveling too fast. 3",

I was watching the traffic when I noticed that the traffic was slowing down.  I was asking my mom if she could see the reason for the traffic slowing down?   Now I can't really remember who said, \"Look at that flying over the mountain!\"  We were just in \"awe\" of what we were seeing.  Now, the traffic coming and going from the state line had come to a complete stop!  An airship, dark gray in color, shape like a triangle, was flying over the mountain with a white light from the center as if it was scanning the country side, searching for something.  It was like 3 football fields wide as well as long.   As it was flying above us very slowly, there was NO noise coming from it.  We were amazed as we were looking at it thru th! e sunroof.  My mom was commenting on how low it was flying.  It was solid!  It looked too amazing to be true.   The light that was searching the mountain & field turned off right before the light got to the highway.  We sat there just watching it.  There was NO noise at all when it flew over us!   Everybody just sat there & watched it until it flew out of sight!   That night will forever be ingrained in us!  We believe!:)",

I was actually coming from Council Bluffs, Iowa.  Everything was very foggy and I seen lights from no where.  I was with someone and they said, \"That's a UFO.\"   I originally thought a building was on fire or that an aircraft had exploded.   Shortly after, I begin thinking about the possibilities and explanations of the sighting, the object begin hovering around and more lights begin to turn on.  I would say the sighting lasted about 45 seconds to a min.   After the lights begin to cut off and on it slowly begin to drift east towards Iowa.  The speed of the object begin to pick up, and after I blinked, it was gone.   It wasn't until about 5 minutes after the event did I realize this could have been something that was extraterrestrial.  It was shaped like a diamond though, not the circular traditional shape.   Unfortunately, I don't have pics or video.

Once again it repeated the cycle as the one before it: bright, dim, then disappeared.  By the time I got to my exit at 30th and Dodge, a third \"star\" was starting what appeared to be the same cycle, but I lost it after the horizon went behind the tree line by Boystown/Creighton hospital.

Yes I was ending a date that night about 1:22am and I was scraping her windows while she was in her car.  All of a sudden I seen a reflection like the police helicopter just shined their lights on me I turned around and nothing.  She asked \"what was that light?\"  I said, \"I don't know\".  I did not hear a boom, but some other did from what the news said.  All I know is that-that light was bright!!!  Like I said, I thought the police helicopter shined their light on me, and not even two seconds later, it was gone.   In the morning they were talking about it on the news and did say some people heard a boom. I personally didn't and I was outside.

It was mid summer in the Early 90's and my father, brother and I were playing catch in our backyard in northwest Omaha.  I was around 9 or 10 at the time.  We all spotted a silver disk flying very slowly to the north or northeast at a low altitude.  It was still daylight out but it was nearing night time, and it was a perfectly clear summer day. We lived close to Interstate 680 and Fort street, and the disk appeared to be floating, maybe 2 to 3 miles beyond the interstate.  I did not see any lights on the craft, but my father thought he saw some.  I simply remember the shape of the craft.  It appeared to have a distinct upper section and a smaller lower section.  Depending on the distance, the craft did not look very large I would have to say it was no larger than 60 feet across and 15 to 20 feet top to bottom.  The disk traveled perfectly level for a long time and made no sound whatsoever.  It then began to speed up and it then passed beyond our vision after about 6 minutes. I remember not knowing what the craft was but thinking it was unique and cool.  I had spent much time at epply airfield because my dad worked there for a long time and I had not only flown on commercial airplanes but I had been near them and seen them close up on the ground many times.  I have never in my 30 plus years seen anything fly where this disk flew. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

As soon as you blinked, the light was an immense distance higher than it had been a second previously.   We could see it ascending through the clouds so quickly that it could've climbed out of our sight in probably two seconds.  It then turned back to a static red light (stopped flashing) and darted to the right across the entire sky.  It was moving so quickly that we had to sprint to keep up with it.  It covered the whole horizon.   It then paused on a dime, shifted slightly to the left, and began a fast descent until it disappeared from sight into storm clouds.  Only one light was observed.  It was so high in the sky, and so erratically moving, that we could not place it as any normal object.  We have never seen a normal object move so quickly and at such a high height.

Out of the northern horizon I caught movement.  I caught direct visual and watched a boomerang shaped craft fly from a N-NW to south path.  What I found to be unsettling: dark smoke color, no navigational lights, no sound at all - mid-low altitude, no more than 10,000 feet in altitude.  Speed was alarming as it took 5-7 seconds to cover the direct route.  The shape was nothing I have seen.  It was not a flying wing.  Chevron is close, boomerang is in my opinion the best way to describe.  Thin but congruent, rounded wingtips, no fuselage.",

      "story": "A large bright object that was low on the horizon was pulsating in a stationary position steadily changing color. On January 3rd, 2019, at approximately 22:30 to 23:00, I observed a large, stationary object low in the southeast sky.  My girlfriend, a person on YouTube and I all observed it.  At first glance the object could have been mistaken for Venus but it was too large.  As a process of elimination, I verified that there were no planets or major stars at that location with Google night sky and manual observations of celestial bodies.  I also eliminated the possibility of aircraft easily as there were several commercial aircraft flying at different altitudes and directions.  All the aircraft were very small in comparison. The object appeared to be round but pulsed brightly in a fashion that made it look like it was flaring the light in a sort of diamond shape.  The object cycled through multiple colors at a steady rate and exhibited a range of color beyond what is seen on commercial and private aircraft. There was no sound but I can't say for sure it was silent as it seemed to be several miles away across the city.  I assumed that this object had to have been seen by more people than myself due to its size, color shifting and duration that it was visible.  I scanned the local news the following day and none of them mentored it.  I did find a video on YouTube of someone else that did see it, and they shot a video of it with their phone.  I didn't stay out to see the object disappear but the person shooting the video did.  They filmed it until it just vanished from sight.  It didn't fly away.  It faded from view while never moving during the entire episode. I will attempt to upload the video or link it for you to review.  I didn't try recording it myself because my phone camera doesn't zoom out to distances that far well and the video from the other person I found does not properly show exactly how large and brilliant the object actually was.

There was an oval/rectangle shaped craft in the sky, with two lights on the sides of it, but that was it for lights.  I thought at first it was an airplane, but after a few moments of staring at it I realized it couldn't have been.  It was hovering around the tops of the buildings, and was staying pretty still.  I watched it for a few moments, before we passed by a treeline, and I lost sight of it.  When we re-emerged, the craft was gone.

The ISS track was from the northwest to the southeast.  As the ISS came to a point high in the sky, I observed another object overtake the ISS, and nearly on the same path as the ISS.  The object was moving across the sky much faster (perhaps 5 times faster, or even more) than the ISS.  It passed the ISS within a degree or two about when the ISS was overhead, and continued on to the southeast.  The object did not maintain a constant brightness, rather it became visible for perhaps 3 or 4 seconds and then faded out for several seconds, but on a repeating and consistent basis, as if it were tumbling.  It appeared to be a point source and did not have lights (strobes, rotating beacon, navigation lights, etc.)  that would be representative of an aircraft.",
