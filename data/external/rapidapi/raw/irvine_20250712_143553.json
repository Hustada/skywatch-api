      "story": "Circluar shaped object outlined with blue lights flying over Irvine, CA I know John Wayne Airport is really close by but it has a curfew, and it's not that close enough to make the planes look that big when they take off. This thing was a perfect disc shape. It was a saucer, it had very bright blue lights that outlined the sides, it varied in speed from practically hovering to way too fast for any helicopter to ever catch up, and it even flew on it's side and while changing it's angles. And it was either really big, or really really close. And it just stayed flying around in the same general area for a long time, five or ten minutes. I know helicopters don't do that and if they did, they would have a searchlight looking for something. This thing looked like it was just having fun flying around as if it was joyriding. And if it were a helicopter it would make that continuous droning helicopter sound. I think this thing was actually really close because I did hear it make some noise every now and then, depending on if it was flying towards me or away or if it was flying flat or on its side. And it definitely did not sound like a helicopter. It made this sort of high pitched buzzing sound. Sort of like those toy planes, but a little different. When I first saw it, I was actually walking back to my dorm hall on the UC Irvine campus. Judging by the area where it stayed flying for the ten minutes or so that I saw it, I know I couldn\u2019t have been the only one to have seen it. It was only around 10 o\u2019clock at night and I would guess that it was flying somewhere in the direction of the 405 Freeway or the Irvine Spectrum Mall; somewhere anyone could get a good, unobstructed view of it. But I went up to my room, and the window of my room faces the same area where it had been flying when I had initially seen it outside, and it was still flying around for another few minutes. And when it went away, it didn't fly off into space, it looked like it was flying downwards to earth and it disappeared from my view behind the other dorm halls and trees.",

My girlfriend asked me what was wrong, and I told her to turn around at the next street after we had passed it.  As we drove up the hill, I got a closer look and saw that there was blue and red lights spinning around the outer rim at about 1 revolution every 5 seconds.  I told my girlfriend to make a right into the \"Strawberry Farms Golf Course\" to take a closer look, but she refused and we had to drive another mile before we could take another glimpse at it.  When we returned, the object had flown about 1/2 a mile away on top of a hill, and was very hard to spot.  I was going to take a picture, but could not get a clear shot from a moving vehicle, especially with a camera phone.",

Last night, the moon was a bloody red and the sky was blue and black and purple. it appeared very ominous but still nothing to flip out. While I was driving, everyone in the car claimed to smell the sweet sweet aroma of vanilla cupcakes. We were out in the middle of nowhere, not knowing where we were apart from the fact that it was en route to irvine. They thought it was rather strange that the smell would be so prominent in the middle of the night, when we're surrounded by nothing but hills. Soon after, everyone in the car started exclaiming, 'omg, wth is that?! look at that!?\" from the corner of my eyes, all I could see were lights. It looked like a car was coming from a merging lane. When I actually looked over, i saw this triangular shaped aircraft. It had two lights, and was tilted at a 45 degree angle. It was flying at the same level as us, as if it were a car. And then, for some incomprehensible reason, this unidentified aircraft flew right in front of us, cutting us off. I was driving at 80 miles per hour, and was forced to brake. It might sound bizarre and a little egotistical, but it really, really, really, seemed like it was out to get us. It pretty much intercepted us. changed directions right when it came in front of us. And when it was ahead of us, it took off, and decided to head towards the sky. It made no noise. You know how airplanes and things like that make an insane amount of noise even if you're about a mile way? well, it was close as hell to us and we heard nothing from it.",

      "story": "Blue/White Circular UFO near UC Irvine's Mesa Court at 9:30 p.m. on 5/19/08 I am a student at UC Irvine living in the Mesa Court Undergraduate Housing near the intersection of Campus and University Ave. I reported about a similar, if not the same UFO that I had witnessed 11 days ago flying in the exact same place as tonight. I was in my dorm room on the third floor which faces Parking Lot 5, when I heard the same sound that I had heard a week and a half prior coming from the UFO. Again it sounded similar to that of a toy plane, but I think it\u2019s buzz is a little bit higher pitched than a toy plane. I looked out of my window and there it was, the UFO outlined with blue lights, flying closer to my housing community. I ran outside, this time determined to get a video of it, but when I went outside, I realized that I wasn\u2019t wearing my glasses so it just looked like a small thin line of blurry blue lights. So I ran back up to my room, grabbed my glasses, and ran back outside. I could see it clearly now, flying overhead like last time, in what seemed like the direction of the 405 freeway. I ran towards the parking lot so that I could get a better video of it, but unfortunately, all that my video camera was able to pick up was a spot of blue light. There were other students in the parking lot also. There were a couple of guys by their car, one of them I heard saying to his friend, \u201cIt\u2019s a UFO, it has to be.\u201d After all, it was in plain sight, flying fairly low to the ground, probably no higher than one of those privately owned propeller planes that I see a lot of flying around Irvine. I\u2019ve read other UFO reports from people who have seen them near the UC Irvine campus and it seems like there are two common sightings: one has blue lights and the other has white lights. From my dorm room, as well as when I saw it without my glasses, it looked like it had blue lights. But when I got a closer look in the parking lot, it seemed to have white lights. Maybe the lights look different depending on how close you are. But the lights themselves looked slightly different this time; t! hey didn \u2019t necessarily look like clean rectangles that outlined the sides like last time, instead they seemed to have an edge, sort of like a cross between circles and triangles, that outlined the edge. And there seemed to be some sort of a flickering light underneath, within its circular shape that flickered every now and then. It stayed flying in the same place for about ten minutes, flying at different angles as well as hovering in place for a few seconds at one point. I also saw a helicopter that seemed to be flying towards its direction. After a few minutes, I ran to another spot near the parking lot to hopefully get a better quality video of it but a few seconds after I got there, it slowly started flying away behind the trees and apartments and disappeared from my sight. There were another couple of guys in the parking lot who obviously saw it. One of them was waiting in the parking lot while his friend ran across the street when there were no cars coming and tried to run up the hill where the apartments are located to see where it was going. I doubt he was able to locate where it had gone because he came back a couple minutes later looking a little disappointed; so was I that I couldn\u2019t get a better video of it.",

Our building is at the end of a street named Goddard and right behind us are hills and some wilderness. I was out back talking on my cellphone and having a cigarette, just as I finished my phone call I happened to look up at a passing jet airliner. John Wayne Airport isn't too far away, so we see alot of air traffic. Well, as I was observing the jet, another object moved into view. What caught my eye was the sun reflecting off it's surface. At first I thought it was a weather balloon, as it was translucent in nature. It was a solid shape at first, like an aspirin. Then it lost it's shape and became unstable and undulated along. It did this for a moment, and then became a sphere, then going back to undulating. I watched it sharply and then it just disappeared. I'm not sure if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but I know what I saw. Also, I should mention a few other details such as it's size. While at first appearing small, the jet passed right underneath it. The jet was pretty high up there, so this thing must have been about 1/6 the size of the aircraft. Even though it was translucent, I did notice that whenever the sunlight reflected off it's surface, the material briefly became dark and metallic. Also, the object was coming from the direction of the hills behind us (west) and was heading east towards Santiago Mountain.",

I am very skeptical about UFO's however both the group I was with and a large number of people (about 50) were staring into the sky wondering what the object was. We did not hear the sound of a helicopter and do not believe it was an airplane due to its ability to hover and the tight circles it was doing in the sky.

Then all of the sudden she said \"Hey do you see that?! That thing in the sky!\"  I thought nothing of it until I looked up again toward the sky and saw two bright blue circle of lights flying around the sky. We turned into the Mesa Court dorms' parking lot to catch a better look at it but as we turned around back, our view was obstructed by the buildings themselves. By the time we came around the corner and into an open area the lights were gone already. To be honest, I was really doubtful of what we saw because I do not believe in those type of things- UFO and all, but I searched on Google and came across this site that reported two other reports of seeing circle lights in the sky. She said that she saw two flying circles one above the other circling the buildings high above. I was driving at around 50MPH, passing by the wild life reservation area toward the university campus when we witnessed this. Did anyone else see it?  You can e-mail me if you saw it also.",

I was in the industrious part of Irvine where there are many buildings, so the horizon line was out of sight to me.  These two dots appeared to be disks.  One was more aggresive than the other and they would glow a very bright blue/white(similar to those new headlights cars have nowadays) and a few times turned very red(just like a brake light).  Four other of my co-workers witnessed this as well.  About one hour later, another co-worker who moves our trucks for us(we work in a warehouse) saw the objects as well. I work nights and our shift takes lunch from 9:30 to 10pm.  When I saw these objects I waved a co-worker over to see them.  I also work near an airport, John Wayne, and remember thinking that those dots were planes.  But they were far to high in the sky and they seemed to be rising and hovering in the same area.  As stated before, they would glow extremely bright.  The \"dots\" looked more like a disk from time to time, mainly when the would glow brighter.  Seriously, I have no explanation what they could be.",

When I exited the fwy I pulled to the side of the road and watched it hover close to the fwy.  It looked as though it was spinning because it was wobblig.  It moved up, then down, then started to move North towards the Irvine Spectrum.  All of a sudden, the object dropped down like it fell from the sky then shot up into the air and disappeared.  I started to freak out becuase I knew what I saw so I stayed a minute to see if it would come back.

      "story": "Circle of blue lights On the evening of April 17, 2007 I went out onto my front yard for a smoke before bed.  It was about 9.55 p.m. PST.  My house faces NNE.  The planes approaching Orange County Airport approach my house from the NNE and go past North to my left to the NW to land at OC approximately 8-9 miles away.  Normally I can see the planes unaided and hear them as they descend. This night was overcast so I could hear some but not see them as they broke cloud cover once they had passed my house.  As I was standing on my driveway, I saw some blue light aloft to the North moving back and forth, almost flittering like a moth.  I initally thought it was a police helicopter.  This is a well populated suburb community and it's not unusual to see one of those things circling around.  What I thought was unusual was that it was moving more in a quick back and forth movement instead of what is usually seen as a slow circle.  Also, I could not see a strong search light or hear an engine sound.  It appeared that the object was 1-2 miles away.  I thought this was odd so I retrieved a pair of quality 20x binoculars that I keep hanging on a coat rack inside the front door.  What I saw raised the hair on the back of my neck.  These lights seemed to consist of a row of individual blue lights that first were traveling to the left.  As the object reversed direction, the object appeared to be first an ellipse and then a full circle that had maybe 24-30 individual blue lights around the perimeter.  It then traveled to the right and reversed the process again forming a circle at the end of its travel when reversing direction.  Its travel in each direction was maybe 3-5 seconds.  There were definitely no red/green port/starboard lights, only the blue perimeter lights and no strobe lights.  I watched this object for 2-3 minutes and I believe it was out there longer than that since I noticed it there soon after I initially stepped outside.  It finally disappeared into the cloud cover.  I waited a few minutes to see if it would come back but it was gone.  I don't have a working video camera and probably would not have had time to get it if I had.  I don't really want my name associated with this.  I'm a 55 year old engineer and I've never really believed that something like this could not be identified, but I have never seen anything like this.  I used to fly small aircraft so I have some experience with the shapes and types of various small planes.  BTW, the only thing I drank that night was a cup of tea and a glass of Metamucil so I was completely aware of what was happening.  If you would like to contact me, please respond to my e-mail address.  If you would like to speak to me, let me know and I'll call you, or respond to you with a phone number to reach me.  What I would find crazy about this is if no one else saw it.  As said, although the community is quiet and most people are in bed or in home at that hour, there are enough people around here that someone else should have seen this to collaborate.  If you would to contact be, do so at the e-mail listed in witness information. ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from others who may have been witness to this object.  PD))",

As soon as the thought occurred about the shooting star, the light seemed to hesitate for a split second and wobble slightly.  It suddenly and I mean SUDDENLY changed course about 30 degrees and headed due west toward Los Angeles at an astonishing high rate of speed. I tried to follow it and dropped my soda can in the process but it I lost it behind a palm tree. It was just going too fast to follow.  Of course I do not know what it was, but I do know that it wasn't a shooting star because it changed direction. It wasn't an airplane or helicopter because there was no flashing beacon. It was not a satellite because it was going too fast and changed direction.  Commercial airlines fly over my house on a regular basis.  They fly over at about 10,000 feet altitude.

Disc appeared reasonably large - maybe 40 feet in length, but viewing perspective made it appear very thin. The disc appeared to be very 'real' and solid in nature; I did not see any form of glowing or radiation of bright color. Object was gray/brown - I believe. It was hovering and completely/effortlessly static. Notably, it was tilting distinctly to its southernmost side. I viewed the object from the freeway, but could not alert my wife's attention to it quickly enough before a freeway bridge and trees obscured it from my view. I pulled off the Culver exit and drove west over the freeway to attempt a better view, feeling sure that we would be able to view something explainable, but the object was no longer visible. I often question if I had actually seen the object, but cannot account for how I could imagine the length, flatness and angular titling of the disc if I had indeed been confused or subject to some kind of illusion.

I immediately noticed 3 diamond shaped light configurations in the northwest corner of the sky towards Newport Beach, CA.  I of course stopped and just stared.  They were moving very fluidly, counter clockwise and then clock wise, back forth with no apparent set pattern- like kites would do.  The lights were a very bright light blue. They would go completely off and them come back on.   I couldn't make out exactly what type of craft they were on.  I watched for about a minute and then two of them disappeared and just one remained.  I saw it go behind a cloud and then reappear...so they had to be at least at cloud level.  They were quite high in the sky because I was seeing them way over trees and building tops.  I knew immediately that what I was seeing just by the shear movement of them was not an airplane, helicopter or military craft.  I was already running quite late so I got in the car and headed to meet my friend, while I was driving I tried to hang my head out the window to see the remaining object.  I wound up right under it when I got to the intersection and could make out a faint outline of some sort of a craft that looked grayish.  I was a little worried at that point, realizing I was right under it.  Then the traffic light turned and it was above my car so I could no longer see it.  I called two friends and tried to get them to go outside and se if they could see it as well, but didn't reach them in time.  Southern California is a big place with a huge population and I'm quite sure lots of other people had to see this as well.  The whole experience left me in awe and made me feel quite small\u2026.there\u2019s a big \u201cworld\u201d out there obviously and I doubt we here on earth are much more than a speck.",

Please see below.  PD)) From 9:46PM until 10:22PM, 2 unidentified objects were witness by myself seemingly \"dancing\" in the cloud covered night skies.  These 2 objects were circular, with lights ringing the outside perimeter of their circumference.  Their movement was eratic, ranging from hovering, to then quickly darting about while flipping and rotating. As the objects flipped in abrupt directional changes, the top of the disk appeared to be a dark metallic.  The lights surrounding the craft would ocassionally flash brightly.  It appeared as if the objects were ringed with 8 white lights, and 1 larger red one; which by watching the movements of the objects, would indicate being the 'front'. The objects were visible this entire time just barely under the low slung clouds.  They would dart in and out of the cloud cover, and then stay for extended periods below the clouds.  It appeared that their relative distance from the observers did not change that much, only altitude. Photos will be forthcoming. Observers were:  Myself:  Corporate President My Girlfriend:  Mathematics Teacher  (Irvine High School) Neighbor:  Custom Home Developer Neighbors Wife 2 Visiting Relatives of Neigbors 1 Other new neighbor, apprx 25 yrs of age, name and occupation unknown ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Apparently, this report is in all likelihood a false alarm.  I called the Irvine Police Dept and they stated that there is a local resident that conducts experiments from time to time that have in the past generated similar reports of UFO's.  They continued to state that he normally reports in first, before conducting these experiments, but that tonight he did not.  However, the are reasonably certain that this is probably the source of our observations. Given the late hour, I will not press my neighbors to compile the photos and video tonight, however, will retain the information awaiting you verification of this mundane event.  If for any reason this was not what actually happened, all materials will be available for you. Thanks!",

But as I got closer it became clear this was no plane nor was it a blimp due to its shape which was honestly dark and was only viewable due to some overcast skies reflecting the city lights behind it.  To me it looked like a soccer ball shape with 4 courners that seemed to flare  By this time im now very close to it and can see 3 more new lights that were red and staggerd between the first lights I seen from the front.

It was just yards away on the oppisite side of the freeway so im lo! oking out my driver window stumped and somewhat suprised it was just sitting there.  I would argue til the end of time that it was not a blimp. Ive seen plenty of them to know this was much smaller and not elongated.and it was not a helicopter as it made no sound and was definately not equipped with rotors.

We were having a lovely evening and playing cards and had not decided to go watch fireworks.  When the fireworks began, we decided to take a break and hustled so we would be able to see them. I was in the back seat of the car and looking out what I believe to be toward the northwest.  I saw a golden globe hovering in the sky, not very high but not low either, like the height of fireworks.  I asked if the fireworks were over that way.  They were not in that direction but in the opposite direction. I looked and saw it again.  I mentioned to them that I think I was seeing a UFO but since it was 4th of July, I chalked it up to possible fireworks.  I did mention it again on the way home it had left an impression. It was gold, not bright gold but pale yet had a definite brightness that seemed to be contained in some way.  I had some sense that it may have been spinning.  I felt it had some purpose and that it was doing something. It continued to be on the back of my mind throughout the evening.",

      "story": "6 extremely bright lights, surrounding a dark bodied craft, moving very slowly September 3rd, 2012. Irvine, California. (about 40 miles south of Los Angeles)  Approximately 4:45 pm, warm clear day, bright sunlight, sun was a bit off to the west, and there was no clouds. It is the afternoon, the sun is arcing towards the west, but still quite high in the summer afternoon. I\u2019ll try to present the experience without interpretation first, just as you would experience it, then save my interpretations for the end. While doing the backstroke in my pool, I was looking up at the clear, bright blue sky. There were a few birds, and occasional passing airplanes in the sky. Nearly directly overhead, (just very slightly to the east, but still very substantially overhead), I saw a VERY bright light, fairly large, (compared to the apparent size of commercial aircraft at cruising altitude) or possibly a tight group of lights. It looked very, very bright, like the brightest of stars, only this was visible in the daytime. It also looked quite a bit bigger than any star you see at night. I only mention the word \u201cstar\u201d here, to give at least some idea to the reader, as to what caught my eye. It looked stationary. That seemed odd to me, because all aircraft I know of have some motion. I wasn\u2019t quite sure if it was moving or not, so I swam over to the edge of the pool, stood stationary myself, and placed the edge of the roof of my house in my sightline to the object, so as to better determine if it wa! s moving. Comparing it to the tiles of my roof, I could see that it was moving, but VERY slowly. There was no trail, and the lights stayed a brilliant white color. After a couple of minutes, I was so curious about it\u2019s apparent odd size, extreme brightness, and lack of velocity, that I went inside (dripping wet!), and got my Tasco 10x-40x63 zoom binoculars. I tried to look at the object freehand without steadying the binoculars, but the image was too jerky. I tried using a table first, then a chair, but it was still too shaky. I found that the best way was to lie on the pool deck, and look almost straight up. Once I got situated, I again used the \u201czip focus\u201d center wheel, and focused on the object first without any zoom at all, (no zoom gives a wider field of view, and makes it easier to initially locate an object in the sky). I could clearly see that it was not a single point of light, but rather, a dark tubular craft of some sort, with several extremely bright lights clos! e around it. It looked to be about 6 lights. I initially thoug! ht I was looking at a satellite, with solar panels reflecting the bright sunshine, and I wasn\u2019t alarmed at all. If I tried zooming in all the way, it would get blurry, so I couldn\u2019t zoom all the way. I could only zoom in about 2/3rd of maximum zoom, without it going out of focus. Even though my arms were fairly supported, the image was still somewhat shaky. I kept trying to brace myself better, to get a clear, more stationary image. At times, when I could hold steady, I was able to see the object fairly clearly, or as clear as possible. The lights were so extremely bright, that it made it hard to see the dark body of the craft. As best as I could make out, the body was a long, dark, and seemed to connect to the lights around it.  It looked as if a parking lot light standard had drifted up into the sky, with about 6 lights, connected by a dark body. During this time, the object was slowly but steadily moving across the sky, towards the east.  I got my wife and daughter to come outside and check it out. My wife tried looking through the binoculars, but was unable to locate it through the eyepieces. She\u2019s unfamiliar with using them, and hard to teach. By this time, it had traversed from being directly overhead, (\u201c0\u201d degrees) to about 75 degrees, down towards the neighboring houses\u2019 roofline. It was getting smaller, and farther away as time went by. I had already seen the best view of it that I was ever going to get, so I gave up following it across the sky, and went inside and searched the internet for coo-berating sightings. There are no coo-berating sightings so far. I called the Irvine Police Department, but they had no reports at all, even in a city of over 250,000. Nasa\u2019s website did have a projected orbit path of the International Space Station, that showed it crossing southern California about 5 pm.  Interpretations-  At first, I thought it was a commercial jet aircraft, maybe at 35,000 to 40,000 feet. As we know, even though they may be doing over 500 mph, they appear to move very slowly across the sky, because their great height makes it hard to gauge their velocity. But this object wasn\u2019t even moving fast enough to fit that model. It was either moving much slower than that, or it was \u201corbiting\u201d at a much greater altitude. From the time I first sighted the object directly overhead, until the time I quit tracking it, it made about a 75 degree arc across the sky. A commercial jet aircraft, at typical altitude and cruising speed, would not take the 9 minutes or so that this object took to traverse that arc, and was visible for. A commercial jet does not fit this model for that, and others reasons, below. Sometimes, a shiny aluminum jet, especially like those used by American Airlines, can turn just right, and if the surfaces are angled right, you can catch a glint of the sun, making the aircraft appear very bright in the sky, even on a bright, sunny day. Only this craft had no typical wings, like you can see on 747s and the like, even at their typical cruising altitudes.  And, this craft was much, much brighter than that. I thought the lights were possibly solar panels, which may reflect the sunlight much better than shiny aluminum.  This object was VERY bright. Just like a star, but you don\u2019t see stars on bright sunny days. And there were several points of light around the dark bodied craft, so a star doesn\u2019t fit the model.  Living close to several airports, I am familiar with what a commercial aircraft looks like, flying at typical 35k-40k feet, 500+ mph. The observed velocity, brightness, apparent altitude, did not fit this model.  The International Space Station was actually my first guess. There are some aspects of the sighting that are congruous with the ISS. These are- A central body, and solar panels surrounding, that may reflect sunlight, and this object seemed to be following an orbit of sorts. And there are aspects of this sighting that are not congruous with the ISS, (and space junk, + dying satellites, for that matter) First off, in my internet investigation, I learned that satellites need to orbit at 17,500 miles per hour to fight gravity, and stay in orbit. This speed generates centrifugal force that combats gravity. If they slow down, their orbit decays. They also orbit at least 60 miles up, above most of the artmosphere. Some orbit at 100 miles up, or 400, or 1200 miles altitude. No satellites orbit within ten miles of the earth, because the atmosphere would burn them up at 17,500 mph, and the atmosphere would slow them down. As a decaying satellite orbit hits the atmosphere at 17,500 mph! , they get hot, and burn up on re-entry. In contrast, this sighting of mine was of an object moving excruciatingly slowly. This fact is completely inconsistent with space junk, the ISS, falling satellites, communications satellites, spy satellites, and it is also inconsistent with geo-synchronous satellites, that are in geo-synchronous orbit.  In fact, all satellites, regardless of whether they are geo-synchronous, or orbiting at 17,500 mph, are completely inconsistent with this sighting. This is because satellites orbit above the atmosphere, and are not visible in the daytime. When the sun lights up the atmosphere, you can\u2019t see the light of stars, nor man-made orbiting satellites. The atmosphere is too bright to allow any viewing of objects like satellites, that orbit 60 miles up, or 400 miles up, and more. The first 10 miles of atmosphere are the thickest, and if you are going to see anything flying with the naked eye, or binoculars, it isn\u2019t going to be outside the first ten miles of atmosphere. The only reason you can see the moon sometimes in the daytime, is because it is so extremely huge, that it allows your eye to perceive its\u2019 presence. It is true, that if you know exactly where to look, you may see an \u201ciridium flare\u201d even in the daytime, where the light of the sun is briefly reflected towards your location, from a passing satellite. This is an extremely brief flash, (and a rather dim one at that), as it is moving at 17,500 mph. This fact is totally inconsistent with my sighting, that lasted about 9 minutes, and was extremely bright. An iridium flare is only visible for the time that the solar panels are angled so as to reflect the sun back to your eye. Because they are moving so fast, and because they don\u2019t rotate to keep the sun focused on you, they only make a very brief, small, dim dash of light. Check \u2018em out on YouTube. They aren\u2019t much to look at, and are completely inconsistent with what I saw, which was an extremely bright, and continuous  cluster of lights, that moved extremely slowly, had a dark body, and took about 9 minutes to traverse a 75 degree arc across the sky.  On YouTube, you can see videos of the ISS passing overhead at nighttime. It streaks across the sky very rapidly. Not as fast as a \u201cshooting star\u201d, but much much faster than what I saw. The ISS also appears fairly dim. Somewhat like a small star. Even through my binoculars, the ISS would still look like a dot of light, and you wouldn\u2019t be able to see the degree of detail that I saw, not at all. What else could have a dark body, be surrounded with about 6 lights so bright, they rivaled the sun, make absolutely no noise, stay at the same brightness for 9 minutes, and take 9 minutes to traverse 75 degrees across the sky? Helicopters could arc across the sky like that, but they make a ton of noise, and this didn\u2019t look anything like a helicopter at all, (nor a Harrier jump-jet, or even a group of weather balloons, nor a blimp) Even if you could attach lights as bright as stars on any of those crafts, they still wouldn\u2019t look like what I saw. A group of balloons would not reflect the sun like what I saw. This object had lights so bright, they were like small suns in themselves. The reflection of the sun off of satellite solar panels is the closest earth-borne analogy to the brightness of light that I witnessed. But as stated earlier, satellites are completely incongruous because of altitude and speed, and the fact that you can\u2019t see them in the daytime. But the sun/sola! r panel possibility is closest to explaining the brightness and sheer quantity of light emanating from this craft.  Like I said, it looked like (closest analogy possible coming up right here), a parking lot light standard, (minus the pole, just the light cluster), that floats within the visible atmosphere, with no apparent means of motion, and a dark, central body.  So to wrap up, my sighting is inconsistent with the ISS, space junk, any known satellites, balloons, Harriers, commercial aircraft\u2026I can\u2019t think of anything made by mankind that fits all the criteria. It is definitely an unidentified flying object. Any ideas?",

I have recounted the event to several people in casual setting without any sufficient explanation. I was unaware of such a place that I could record what I saw, that\u2019s why I have never formally submitted what I saw. In 2007 I lived in Southern California in a town called Irvine. It\u2019s a crowded city with lots of modern city development and is a \u201cwell off\u201d expensive place to live. I was separated from my significant other and spent a lot of time waiting to pick up my daughter from her mother\u2019s house so I would hang around different places until we could meet for me to pick her up. It was while waiting for my daughter one evening at a local park that I saw this UFO. Irvine has a park called \u201cColonel Bill Barber\u201d park that is very well kept and has beautiful walking paths, tennis courts, and softball fields and playgrounds. I was walking between 9:00 and 10: PM at night in the summer time at a location on the walking path that was elevated 30 feet above the rest of the park. The walking path comes to a memorial on a hill where commemorative placards and a U.S. flag are displayed. From this point you can look out over the north side of the park with tennis courts to the right. The hill was not so high as to be able to see over the privacy netting of the tennis courts. While standing on this hill and facing north my attention was drawn to something out of the corner of my right eye. This area is well lit with amber colored lights on the parking lot and bright lights on the tennis courts. Some distance south of the tennis courts but within the boundary of the park two yellow orbs rotating in a counter clock wise rotation (as on the face of a clock) caught my eye. I stared at them in amazement and disbelief. They rotated keeping seemingly equal spacing from each other and constant rotational speed as these two yellow orbs moved from my right to left across in front and just above where I was standing. They gradually accelerated from the point where I first noticed them to the point just in front and to the left of me where they began to climb in altitude and vanish. The total distance the orbs traveled while I could see them was around 300ft and less than 100ft off the ground. I was feeling like I had just witnessed two spirits at play maybe! fascinated with the movements of the tennis ball at night? The orbs were moving with machine like precision so I also wondered if I had witnessed some type of energy from an engine source on some type of space craft. I also tried to reason if I was hallucinating?  There was no sound that I could remember other than the sound of tennis racquets striking tennis balls and the noise of cars and traffic on the nearby roads. I believe in extra terrestrial life. What I saw was unlike anything I have ever heard anyone describe except for sightings of colored orbs that have random movements.",

It was so loud that the instant I was awakened, I covered my ears.  I had a hard time even moving because it was so loud.  I did not open my eyes.   This loud noise continued for about 1-2 minutes straight.  I feel like I saw a flash of bright light, maybe white or yellow in color right as the noise began; however I cannot confirm the color as I did not open my eyes.   Then it sounded like whatever was creating the noise drove/flew/etc away but still making the continuous shrieking sound but it got fainter and fainter as it went further and further away.   My bedroom is on the 3rd floor of my condo and my bed is positioned exactly the same height as the window.  My head is right in front of the window.  I always keep my window opened.  The sound that I heard felt like it was literally right outside of my window.   I have a house ! and fire alarm; however this sound was not either of those.  It was a sound I have never heard before and still have not heard since then.  I don\u2019t remember anything past this point but woke up the next morning with a very strange almost nauseating feeling.   The next morning, I asked my sisters if they heard that loud shrieking noise and they both said \u201cno\u201d.

      "story": "UFO sighting, 2 objects, May 11, 2013, approximately 10:30pm, Irvine, CA I spotted two very distinct objects in the night sky over Irvine, CA while looking eastward from my northeast-facing bedroom window. Unfortunately, I did not have any camera equipment or binoculars available.  I could not see the shape of the craft, but the lights appeared to be large (but different sizes), different colors of red, white, and yellow. There were approximately 5 to 8 different lights on each object.  The red light appeared to be the largest, but there were more of the yellow lights surrounding it.  I could not say for certain if the lights were flickering, but they did not appear to blink or pulse.   The lights formed an oval shape.  Both of the objects appeared identical to me.  They appeared at first to be very small objects, at least a few miles to the East, traveling steadily West (towards my location).  I can only estimate speed to be somewhat faster than a helicopter, but slower than a commercial jet.   The entire sighting was probably a full 15 minutes as the obj! ects approached my location before their ascent and disappearance.  There seemed to be a noticeable increase in speed as the objects ascended, but I can't really say for sure.  I did not hear any noise from the objects.  Everything was very quiet.  The objects followed a very similar (perhaps identical) westward flight path just a little beyond my location (about 8 miles from the Orange County airport) at an estimated altitude between 20,000 to 25,000 feet, and then ascending so high that the bright colored lights completely disappeared into the night sky. I feel confident that the objects ascended because they were getting smaller and smaller until I could no longer see them.  And I also feel confident that the objects would have needed to be higher than 35,000 feet to completely disappear because commercial aviation lights are still visible with my own eyes (at night while traveling at typical, long distance cruising altitudes).",

It looked like it was about 5 to 10 miles away.  The object was moving in place in small movements side to side and up and down. The lights were brighter than a small star.  The object was moving in place, but moving in a downward trajectory.  When it was at about 20 degrees I lost track.  It was up for more than 30 minutes.",

      "story": "Like nothing I have ever saw before.  I can\u2019t explain what I saw. I work for the Fire Department in my hometown.  I had just got off work and had pulled into my driveway at home.  As I exited my car, I noticed a very bright white light in the sky. I stopped and began looking at this light, thinking it may be a medical helicopter taking off from a nearby helipad.   As I looked at this light it didn\u2019t take long for me to rule out it being a helicopter.  What I was looking at was actually at least 3 very bright, white balls of light.  These balls of light looked to possibly be connected.  And directly above and below these balls of lights was either a long, thin stream of light or possibly some sort of lit up structure.  Sort of reminded me of a jack, like you would find in a children\u2019s game.  Only it was a brilliant white color.  As I began to study this object, I began to notice that the balls of white light were actually rotating around fairly slow.  There was definitely no sound whatsoever.  I live out in a more rural area of the co! unty.  There was not a cloud in the sky when I observed this object.  I had a very clear, unobstructed, view of this object.  It was fairly high up in the sky, but not nearly as high as other objects such as stars or possible satellites.  Things such as that can definately be ruled out.   I continued to watch this object for 30 minutes or so.  During this time period the object never appeared to move up or down, or left or right.  It only sat in one spot and rotated.   After 30 minutes, I began to get cold, as well as needed to get some sleep.  So I went on in my home and went to bed.   Oh, one last thing... I did take a couple of pictures of this object with my cellphone.  But unfortunately you can\u2019t make out any of the details of it.  All you can see is one bright white light in the photo.",
