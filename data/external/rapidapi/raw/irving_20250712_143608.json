I was travelling south on hwy.360 just before post and paddock exit when a large triangular shaped aircraft flew right over me. My sunroof was open and I had the radio up, so I didn't hear it, I glanced up and seen the bottom of it about 10 foot higher than the budget suites motel. The U.F.O. then became stationary (hovering) above Ave.k. exit. I watched and my friend as a witness (she was in the truck with me)all the way, going south to Lamar exit, we went almost directly under it. The U.F.O. seemed to have a circular suction cup underneath it with three bright rectaingular lights on bottom that went off and on randomly. As we passed and it was behind us it all the sudden dissapeared. I don't know wich way it headed or where it may have gone. I myself have seen this U.F.O. twice since that night.",

      "story": "UFO Alien Encounters  Two incidents on UFO alien encounters:  The first incident was several years ago; the second one was recently on May 6, 2008.  I don\u2019t know if the whole thing was a dream or if it was real but I can assure you that they communicated to me mentally and not verbally, as we do.  My first encounter with the aliens took placed several years ago.  They took me to their galaxy that had 5 suns and several planets, which I was able to see from their spaceship.  Since our galaxy only has one sun, I was astonished to see so many suns in just one galaxy.  I don\u2019t recall ever getting out of the spaceship; the whole trip was just like a \u201ctour\u201d through the universe.  They were green aliens, very short, not with the usual configuration depicted in Roswell, NM.  Their heads were wide, mostly by the cheeks area and they were very nice to me.  My most recent encounter was with just one alien.  This one had pink skin and came-up in a small gray color spaceship.  His head had a light bulb shape and he was skinny.  He told me via mind communication that it was time for me to go with them for good.  Some sort of force started taking me towards his spaceship (I started floating in the air) but then, suddenly, I decided I did not want to go yet, and saw myself back into my home.  The next day, May 7, 2008, I received a call from one of my doctor\u2019s office, in which I was told they found pre-cancerous cells in a yearly routine exam I recently had.  Every year this exam comes-out normal and, all the sudden, right after the encounter I had with the alien, it happened to come-up abnormal.  Now I am going to have to get a biopsy done on June 2nd to check on the stage level of the cancer findings.",

I cannot think of any craft that can move in one direction, stop and simply reverse its direction without  turning.   Also the other craft, the green bright light was static for most of this time, at the end of the fireworks, it moved very rapidly from the static position and disappeared.   I am sure it was a U. S.

One of which is the producer of a network locally in Fort Worth, Texas, that produces programming for Children's hospitals nationwide.  We know camera lens malfunctions, we know how to debunk lens flare, dust, exposure issues, et al.  We went outside to take photographs of the super moon.  We missed the largest expression of the moon but hurried out to capture what we could.   Standing in the parking lot facing east, I began taking photos.  I noticed an anomaly in the photos which seemed to be a smaller sphere to the lower right of the bright moon.  I looked with my physical eyes at the moon and saw something darker than the moon and sky in the same area.  I took more photos and each one contained the sphere.  It looked very solid.   I decided to clean the lens and take the case off the phone and use an additional lens that hooks on the back of the iPhone 6 Plus.  I saw the object even clearer at this point.  I zoomed in without losing resolution and took a few more.  I examined those with my partner and he was very intrigued and we zoomed in and were awe struck.  It was a sphere but it was a moon.  It looked exactly like our moon only smaller. In the photos, there is a visible lens flare/glare that is bouncing off of the overhead lot lights.  This sphere/additional moon was not a lens anomaly.  To further debunk the oddity, we walked to the park in the middle of our condos.  We saw the bright big moon through the tree tops. I took out the camera and began shooting more pictures.  We figured if it was a lens or camera issue, it would project this second moon overlapping the tree branches, thus copying the image of the actual moon.  Much to our surprise, this secondary moon was shadowed by the branches in the actual placement of where it corresponds and the actual moon/supermoon was not shrouded by branches in real visual observation nor in the photograph.  This blew our minds.! We took several photos and then went inside to grab the very ! large te lephoto lens for the SLR camera and came back out.  We took more photos from the original device, my partners device, and the SLR and there was no second moon present in these photos.  So this phenomenon was present for roughly 5-7 minutes then gone.",

As I sat on the highway, I figured there must be an accident ahead, and then I saw this magnificent light in the sky.  I knew it was not a star, a planet nor tthe moon and I immediately ruled them out.   Tired of sitting on the highway, I got off on the next ramp only to find myself stuck waiting to catch a traffic light.  I was compelled to look at the light because there was something \"off about it\".  It wasn't a helicopter.  It was so quiet outside it really surprised me.   Took a couple of pics then decided to turn on my video.  I witnessed this light shining brighter still, glowing and it appeared to be two circles of light.

It was somewhat similar to a plane however the wings were bent down and forward into a horseshoe like shape.  I was only able to see it for a few quick seconds.

      "story": "Plane with 1 or 2 round white balls flying around. I was about 10 years old with my brother.  This occurred on a Sunday morning around 8 AM in late 1940's or early 50's. The sky was clear. I said a twin engine plane, maybe have been a DC3, with a round white ball coming out of the nose and going into the tail, now I know it was going around the plane.  Not sure if this was 1 or 2 balls.  Not sure how long it lasted.  But I remember seeing it.  This may have never been reported do to the time.

At 5:10 PM, with bright blue skies, I observed to small orange/white light that looked like a bright star overhead at about 80-degrees NNE of my location in Irving Texas.  I could not make out any shape.  It was slowly pulsating and was not moving.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend, and she saw it too.  After about 20 \u2013 30 seconds, I went to my car, a few feet away, to get my binoculars. After retrieving my binoculars, my girlfriend told me that it faded away, and we could no longer see it.",

We were working in the yard, and at 6:20 PM, I observed an object that was bright white at about 60 \u2013 70-degrees elevation to the east of our location.  I could tell it had a shape and was not an airplane. It appeared to be hovering.  I looked through my binoculars and could see it, still very small. It appeared to be at a very high altitude.  It appeared to be a long bright loop, small and nearly closed about 2/3\u2019s of the length and an open loop at the other end.  It slowly changed shapes to an \u201cV\u201d shape.  About a minute or so later, it changed to a \u201c)\u201d shape. A minute or so later, it changed to a straight tube or cigar shape.  I took five pictures with my cell phone. You can see the object as a small white dot in the blue sky, but no details. Enlarging the photo, you can see the shape changes. One picture, you can see the \u201cV\u201d shape. I called the Irving Police department to report what I was seeing and to see if anyone else was reporting it.  I was on the phone with the police department for about 5 minutes, describing what I was still looking at.  They took down my information and said they would check it out. The object was visible for about 10 minutes, slowing moving to the east. Then, at about 45-degree elevation due east, it just disappeared. I called the Irving Police Department back and told them it was no longer visible.",
