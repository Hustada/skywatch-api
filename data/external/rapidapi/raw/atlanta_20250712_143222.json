      "story": "6 lights seen in East Texas Moving strangely It was 22:28 Thursday the 14th this March.  I was waiting outside for my girlfriend to show up, and I looked up to take in the night sky.  I\u2019m used to aircraft flying over the area, it\u2019s semi remote, and off towards the Bivins area (south and slightly west of where I was) was a grouping of six lights.  000 000  At first I thought it was a drone, or some sort of aircraft, because Barksdale AFB isn\u2019t super far, and they have a lot of aircraft down there.  I watch it kind of slowly make it way south west, still not sure what to make out of it yet, and then it suddenly turns a sharp west, and slightly increased speed.  That was when I figured out that this wasn\u2019t some formation of craft, but a single, seemingly large craft, because the way it turned was like a zero turn mower if you improved their turning radius even more.

What really made me report it though was the distance it was covering.  Like 15ish miles a second and when I did some calculations that would be close to 60000 mph.

Don't remember the exact time but it was early twilight so probably between 6 and 6:30 PM(?),  the sun was below the horizon, no glare remaining, just a gradated deepening evening blue.  We were heading west on Ponce De Leon toward Midtown and I was a passenger in the car, front seat.  I was not on any medication, nor had I had any alcohol.   A bright white light appearing to hover near a Midtown skyscraper eventually caught my attention, about a mile distant.  Don't remember the light's  approximate elevation as far as stories go but it was to the right (north) of the skyscraper, several stories lower than the skyscraper's height but above any other buildings in the vicinity.  We were on a hill going toward Midtown and I was looking pretty much straight ahead at the light, not having to peer up into the sky.  I watched the light without thinking anything about it, then began to think about it and imagined it was the bright beam of a helicopter.  As I watched it struck me that it wasn't appearing to move.  By now I was curious because you expect the beam of a helicopter to waver as the vehicle moves and to grow brighter as it progresses, and imagining it a helicopter I had begun to watch for this as it hadn't happened yet.  I was still expecting it to be a helicopter, and so had  mentioned nothing to the driver  about it, when suddenly the light ascended at an incredible rate of speed into the sky, to the north, at about a 45 to 55 degree angle. Before you could snap your fingers it was gone, that fast, from what seemed an absolutely stationary position in the sky.  No trail.  No sound. There appeared to be no acceleration.    The amount of time I spent watching the light before it zipped off may have been as little as 30 seconds, probably no longer than a minute.

      "story": "Sighting during Atlanta morning rush hour Driving to Atlanta, the morning after my wife\u2019s brother died, for my wife\u2019s brother\u2019s funeral with 3 children in the car, it was about 6:30-7am. We were at a standstill in morning traffic on the main interstate coming from Florida. It was a clear morning with no clouds in the sky.  Not moving in the traffic, I glanced up in the sky to my left and saw, very clearly, a shiny silver, object about the height and size as if a helicopter was hovering over the morning traffic.  This object had no propellers though and no wings. It hovered in that position. I turned my head to watch the slowly moving traffic. Then I quickly turned back to the object. It didn\u2019t occur to me what I was seeing.  The shape was that of a blimp, but smooth, shiny and reflective like polished chrome.  I turned to watch traffic again and move as needed. When I turned back to see the object it was gone. I looked around and didn\u2019t see it near by.  If this had been a plane flying into Atlanta\u2019s airport it would still be visible making its way as would a helicopter.  This object disappeared from sight altogether.  My wife\u2019s son also said later that he believes he saw the same object.  With thousands of cars stuck in morning traffic, I can\u2019t believe that I was the only one to see this.

I am a sixty year old Marine corps veteran who has watched the skies since I was a teenage Civilian Observation Corps volunteer.  I do not drink nor take drugs which would interfere with my vision. I hesitated for several weeks to report this anamolous phenomenon because sky conditions have not been ideal -- thunderstorms and clouds, not to mention the urban light scatter that makes observations in Atlanta difficult.  However this sighting has repeated itself a dozen times in the last few weeks and I felt compelled to report it.  In each occurance several hovering lights have been observed out of my bedroom window which faces almost due east.  This view looks out on a main air traffic corridor in and out of ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson International) and PDK (Peachtree Dekalb).  On these evenings I would observe the normal comings and goings of the aircraft, with their landing lights, wing lights, strobes, etc. and what I observed was obviously not an aircraft.  I would see one perhaps two lights hovering in position from just above the horizon, perhaps ten degrees, up to almost directly above.  On one or two occasions the light would appear just after a flash like a strobe,  On others the strobe flash was diffused by a high overcast.  The lights, which varied from a reddish white to a bluish white, would remain stationary for thirty seconds to five minutes, then would fade and in their place a line of lights would appear, usually canted from the horizontal, like a wing making a turn, or sometimes three red lights would appear in the same spot in the shape of a triangle, equilateral or isocoles, then would morph back into a light and move quickly, probably too quickly for an aircraft, to the northwest or southwest, DIRECTLY ACROSS the flight patterns of two airports.  It is extremely difficult to estimate altitude but would not be surprised if they were manuvering over fifty thousand feet.  As I mentioned the cloud cover made it difficult to track them completely across the sky but the consistency of the pattern is remarkable.   It did not seem to exhibit the flight characteristics of an airplane (unless a Harrier jumpjet which is highly inprobable) or a helicopter or a satellite.",

It was very hard to tell how high it was, but it was moving in a general southerly direction. I looked a little further ahead in the path it was headed and noticed a second dot.  This one was not pulsing and was moving much more slowly.  All of a sudden, this appeared to be something spectacular.  The first pulsing dot was moving right toward the second dot!  I watched as it approached, and as the 1st dot got closer, it circled 3/4 of the way around the 2nd dot, then they became one dot.  I don't remember if they pulsed after they merged or not, but they continued at the slower speed of the 2nd dot until I could no longer see them.  The dot moved too far south and I had to get out of the shade of the house, then the sun was too bright to see. At the time I didn't know who to tell.  I wasn't too good on the web at the time.",

We were all standing on a street corner right next to the downtown Atlanta post office and I looked up into the beautiful sky to take in all its glory and as I panned across the top of the Westin Peachtree Plaza hotel something caught my eye.  I saw what appeared to be a \"fleet\" of UFO's noiselessly drifting across the sky in a Northwest to Southeasterly direction.  It was an incredible sight to see at least forty or more objects floating at the same speed, silvery white in appearance contrasted against this crisp, beautiful deep blue fall day.   One of the most amazing views of what appeared to be inexplicable objects that I never would imagine I would see, ever.  There is one detail I have left out till now.

This was a very unusual sight.  From the distance I stood from these craft, estimated at approximately 5,000 feet, the \u201ctether\u201d appeared at arm\u2019s length to be the size in diameter of thread used in sewing.  The objects themselves appeared to be the size of a very heavy \u201cperiod\u201d one would produce with a pencil on paper, held at arm\u2019s length.  When I called attention of this remarkable sight to a local street vendor I was surprised at his reaction.  There was relatively none.  He could care less.  I thought this to be very odd behavior.  He looked up and as quickly as he looked up he went back to his business of selling handbags and sunglasses without uttering a single word.   Our friends from Denmark saw this and remarked that it looked like someone holding \u201cparachute exercises\u201d.  The parachutes of forty plus sky divers over Atlanta at 5,000 feet up, without a single hint of descendi! ng?   Highly unlikely!   This was a curiosity that has stayed wi! th me to -date and I just wanted to report it here and now.  I listen to you on the Jeff Rense show every single time you are on.  I didn\u2019t want to be one of those 99% you talk about that does not report their sightings.  I always wanted to see the typical saucer shape craft with a dome on top.   Little did I think I would see an entire \u201cfleet\u201d of UFOs.   I\u2019ll keep my eyes peeled over-head in hopes that I will someday catch a glimpse of my ideal saucer.  Until then, thank you for letting me share my experience of some 8 years ago.",

As a mechanical engineer, and a long-term skeptic, I promptly rushed to her aide, understanding that she was entranced by satellites or mesmerized by underlit bats. Much to my surprise, at my arrival at SunTrust plaza, located at Peachtree & Baker, I watched as what appeared to be stars swirled and danced, diving into one another, playing in my indigo southern sky. The lights that differed from stars only in their locomotion and lack of twinkling, were clearly above the cloud level, as they frequently would dim or disappear behind the occasional lazily passing cumulus. I can find no rational explanation for these playful sources of lumination.  From aircraft to projections, from critters to carefully-mounted LEDs, my scientific mind boggles at the concept.  They would rush from one end of the sky to the other in seconds, turn back, swirl curved paths, and even hover on the spot.",

We were on our way for dinner, and while on the 10th street near Piedmont Park my sister-in-law pointed out what we are quite sure was a UFO.  We could see it clearly through the left-back-seat-window, as it wasn't very high.  It was moving around quite fast, though smooth and steady enough for us to see that it was circular in shape, and had numerous blue lights on the bottom.  Furthermore it seemed to be of greyish/silverish color.  It was headed for the opposite direction, so we couldn't see it for long and make a video or even attempt to follow it. It is quite unbelievable to us that we may have seen a real UFO.  We have considered many \"normal\" explanations including: fancy spot lights, though if that were the case, we should have seen a beam of light under it, which we didn't; Likewise even a UFO remote control toy:  I have seen a remote control UFO toy, though I am sure it couldn't move around as fast, or over such a long distance in such straight strokes, besides be able to fly over buildings!  Plus it wouldn't be able to support the extra weight of the blue lights. We tried looking around on the net if anyone else had seen it, because there were many people in cars around, and some even on foot. Who knows maybe some security camera around there filmed it, hopefully!",

It was an overcast day, with intermittent showers.   As I was opening my umbrella, I noticed something in the air.  Looking carefully, I see a boxy, rectangular, dark gray shape tumbling through the air.  There was no sound coming from it, and it appeared to be a long way away.  It, for all intents and purposes, looked like a bag inflated with some lighter than air gas that had been released, and yet it did retain its shape rather well.  I reached for my digital camera in my pocket, and took three pictures (I will include these as attachments).  I also took a short video clip (about 1:01), but nothing was obvious when I watched it later.  Approximately 3-4 minutes after I first sighted the object, it disappeared into the cloud cover. I must say that I may not be the ideal witness for such an event.  I am a science fiction fan, as well as an amateur digital artist.  I have also been described as, \" slightly out of touch\" with reality.   However,  I do not make up stories like this.  I am not a glory hound, nor do I believe that aliens visit our planet.  Based on our present understanding of physical law, visiting even a relatively near star (like, say Alpha Centauri, 4.3 LY away) would be a tremendous undertaking.  So, my personal beliefs belie an extraterrestrial origin.  However, It was definitely something that was flying, and I have no idea what it really was, therefore it meets the requirement of being a UFO, in my book.",

I was only 10 years old at the time, and my Father, Mother, aunt and uncle and cousin went to an old drive-in movie theatre just outside of Atlanta.  This drive-in had bleachers at it similar to what you would see on a small sports field. My cousin and i were watching the movie from the bleachers while our parents were still in my uncle's car when a boy on the top row of the bleachers yelled out, '' look, there goes a flying saucer!'' we all looked in the direction he was looking in and there was this brightly lit white object that looked like the lid to a round candy dish with a dome like thing on top. This thing was moving very rapidly just above the tree line and disappeared below the horizon. I didn't think about it after it disappeared and turned around and turned my attention to the movie again until the same kid that first saw it yelled, '' here it comes again!!! but this time this thing was coming directly toward us!  Every child on those bleachers including me and my cousin ran for cover.  We searched frantically for our parents but could not find the car as it was quite dark, so we ran into the building that housed the projector booth and the snack bar.  I told my cousin to look out and see if it was gone, and he said he didn't see it, so we stepped back outside and to our horror, this thing was directly overhead!   We ran again trying to find our parents in the car, and to my great relief i heard my Mom yelling, '' we are over here!'' and we ran to the safety of our parents and the car. This thing looked quite different from the way it did the first time we saw it. It had slowly rotating white lights on it like rectangles stood on end.  Nothing else could be seen but the lights in that circular pattern.  It was about 1,000 ft. AGL and looked to be about 30 ft. in diameter. This thing was dark in the center.  It moved slowly and came from the northwest and moved on toward a southeasterly direction until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance.   My Father was in the U.S. Air Force for 6 years and i asked him what that thing was, his reply, '' I don't have the faintest idea.''   I was horrified by this incident. I have never seen another UFO. I would very much like to know if anyone else has saw a UFO that looked like what we saw that night back in June 1964.  As frightning as this was, i would love to see that thing again now that i am a trained observer. If anyone could let me know what this thing was, i would sincerely appreciate it. My witness count is just an estimate, it is possible that over 50 people could have seen this UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD))",

To the west of I-75 I would say a couple of miles or so away \u2013 difficult to judge distance when the object is in the air \u2013 I saw a large illuminated craft hovering in the sky.  At first I thought I was seeing an airplane coming in for a landing; I was driving and trying to look at the same time.  It was evident that the object was NOT an airplane although it could have been the size of a small plane.  The object was disk shaped and looked to have a bubble top.  There was an orange colored light on the underneath side that pulsed maybe every 10-15 seconds.  I was intent on getting to my destination in Atlanta so I did not pull over or exit the Interstate to investigate \u2013 wish I had.  I look for a logical explanation \u2013 have never seen an object in the air that I could not identify and thought that this object should be a! blimp or an advertising attention getter.  I was told that there has been a blimp in that area for around a week, but I saw that blimp and it is the wrong shape, not illuminated from within, and the light it has is on top of the craft and pulsates more frequently \u2013 and the blimp is on the move, not hovering.  I never saw this other aircraft move.  I was only able to observe it for probably 2 \u2013 3 minutes as I was driving, but it was unusual to the extent that I thought I should report it.",

I popped the hatchback to sit and put on my golf shoes.  As I was putting them on my attention was drawn to the really large American Flag almost directly above me.  I could see a normal chem. Trail going right behind it and thought it was cool looking.  This is why I was looking up. I have (knock on wood) great vision. 20/20 \u2013 And I saw two objects in the sky near another jet (not the same one that had the chem.  Trail behind the flag but a similar jet that I see in Atlanta all the time).  These crafts seemed very silver \u2013 at times the sun reflected off them \u2013 and slowly.  They seemed small, but far and very silver.  I knew right away that they were not normal crafts that I see in the air.  They were very very high in the sky.  They hovered like helicopters but didn\u2019t look or move (left, right, up, down) like a helicopter would.  The other point I really want to underscore is they moved tog! ether.  They seemed to keep the same distance from each other and traveled in the same direction \u2013 but that direction was not just east or west \u2013 more like zig-zag \u2013quite slowly.  I never saw anytime of spinning or jets \u2013 they were real still. I watched them as far as I could as they got smaller.  It was something I will remember forever.  It was such a clear day and such a clear image to remember. And so unlike anything I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

On my way to work this morning, noticed very bright white lights fairly low to the west.   As I was driving along (north on Stanton Rd.), trees and buildings would block my view, got to a spot where I could clearly view it and stopped in the road to see if it was moving.  It was hovering but appeared to drift a bit to the south.  No sound was heard, too bright to be an airplane or helicopter, 3 bright white lights in irregular triangle formation.   A vehicle approached from my rear and I had to proceed as it is fairly narrow road and there was nowhere to pull over.  My first thought was \"ISS\" and then \"blimp\" but no structure could be discerned.  Sky was still mostly dark - I cannot begin to say what it was.   As I pulled onto the entrance ramp for Langford Frwy (166), I glanced back and saw 3 dim white lights moving at speed overhead to the east - I can only assume it was the same object as I had not noticed any other air traffic in the area.    Object  initially was approx. 35 degrees above horizon, maybe half mile away, maybe 1500 feet altitude or more.  Lights werre not spaced uniformly.  Diddn't appear to be any more than 10 feet across, if that much.   It is difficult to give good measurements as sky was dark and lights were very bright and in a triangular cluster rather than spread out as along a wing.  I have reported this also to MUFON.   I contacted Fulton County Airport (Brown Field) to see if they had a  blimp launch from there this morning (object was to their southeast).

We had already been outside for about 15 minutes when we saw a bright light coming towards us across the sky from a distance.  It was traveling much faster than any man made aircraft or jet plane would travel at. At first we had not a clue of what it could be but at this point we knew for sure it was not an airplane or human made aircraft of any kind.   As this object passed right above us it slowed down at a very speedy rate.  The object first turned out as a large orange ball of light going at a tremendous speed, but as it got closer it appeared to have the shape of a triangle.   We could see a large orange triangle shaped light in the center. We could also see that there were 3 blue lights moving in a circular motion around this bright Orange triangle light.  We felt almost as if something in this craft were watching us back. This object was the brightest flying object we had ever seen in the sky in our life.  The object hovered for about another minute or so and disappeared within the blink of an eye.  Not even 30 seconds after this craft disappeared an enormous solid red ball of light passed by in the same path as the other UFO we had just believed to witness.  These objects were completely silent as well and flew about 500 feet above us.   My friend and I remain baffled.",

The road I was driving is quite curvy, so I slowed, and watched for about four seconds.  The blink then reappeared very far away toward the east, then once again, then I never saw another blink.  I did not mention this to anyone, my friends already ridicule my UFO enthusiasm enough.  But walking with a close friend, who absolutely does not believe in UFO's, she reported seeing something &quot;weird&quot; in the sky around the same night of my encounter.  She proceeded to describe the exact same event.  I found out she, though in a different car, was on a nearby road, driving the same direction, at the same time.  She described all of this to me BEFORE I told her of my encounter.  Her description matched all of my details, incl! uding a stationary blinking white light, two blinks toward the east, then no more.  She, however, was not driving and had more time to really observe this object.  I find it most unusual she told me this, since she cringes every time I try to show her anything on UFOs.

It seemed close to the airplane but not close enough to hit the plane.   It had a circular, aqua colored top that appeared hard and a light, silver colored, narrow cylinder coming out of the bottom of it.  In terms of size it was not larger than the wing of the plane.  I\u2019ve Googled weather balloons and it was definitely not a balloon.   I told the people beside me I saw something weird and they started joking around and making reference to the X-Files show.  I laughed out of nervousness.   I reluctantly asked the guy behind me when we landed if he happened to see anything odd from the plane and he said he said he saw it as well and that it freaked him out and that he was just going to pretend he didn\u2019t see it.  He said he was ex military and it was definitely not a stealth probe.   He agreed to go to the pilot afterwards with me.  We told the pilot and the flight attendant at the front of the plane what we saw.  The pilot said it was probably a balloon (which it was not) or a tower on the ground (which it was not) and that they would \"check it out.\"   The other witness and I were surprised that they didn\u2019t ask for our names or info.

So I called my mom outside to see it. Well upon further observation I realized that it was not a star because it was a lot lower than any of the other stars. In fact, it was in the air space as many planes flew by it and it, I live in Southwest Atlanta off of Sylvan Rd.  The object was moving at a slow pace and the thought of it being a plane was quickly dismissed because the light did not match the direction in which it was headed and there were no additional lights.  The object was in my view for a good 45 minutes to an hour before it was no longer visible.  I do have a video recording and picture that I will send as soon as I find out how to upload it from the camera to the computer. On Monday 2/6/12, I saw the same object again also during the eight o\u2019clock hour.  I again called my mom to verify that she saw it and then called my aunt who lives a few blocks away, to look outside and see if it was visible to her.  She didn\u2019t see it so I went to get her so she could have a look and give me her thoughts of what it could be.  She saw it and we presumed to follow it to try and get a closer look, but we were unable to keep visual contact due to the object moving and trees blocking the view.  We did spot it again hit and miss with a clear view when we got to Cascade Rd.

At first, it looked like a distant plane, but the speed, size and close location to our car spoke differently.  My husband didn't see it on the driver's side, but others my have seen it at the intersection.   Immediately, I started having electrical nerve pain in my right elbow down to my hand for a couple of days after.  It was a feeling of banging my funny bone.  May not be related, but I didn't hit my elbow and it happened immediately after it went across the top of our car.",

The first flash appeared as if the source was 20 plus thousand feet in the sky and to my south west. The second flash was same approximately 20 plus thousand feet however to the north west of the sky, literally miles away from the first flash. The third flash was even higher than the first two, and was directly above where the second flash was located however thousands of feet higher as if it shot straight up. The fourth flash was directly beneath the third flash as if it had fallen straight down and appeared to be lower than all the other flashes. I could see that it literally shot back to the south with the last flash being literally miles away in one second. My daughter and I have no idea what we witnessed. I am 51 years old and skeptic to UFO\u2019s, however I know what I saw.  There is no way that this was anything like we have on earth.

My family saw something strange in the sky Tuesday am approx. 6:45am, while in the car, and took pictures of it.  We could not identify the flying object which was too close for comfort.  We kept trying to blow it up from all angles on the cell phone tonight and zoomed down towards the ground on the cell and this is what shows up.  The neighborhood trash was scattered in the street. We have several pictures of the thing and when you zoom in to the head you can see the eyes.  Later that day 2 army trucks were riding through the neighborhood which was strange but we did not pay much attention to it.   I called the non-emergency police number and the young lady told me to call back tomorrow to see if I could get appropriate numbers to call.  What do you think?  Please let me know.  I emailed it to 2 news stations here and was referred to you to file a sighting. You could see it better and blow it up from all angles on the cell phone where the pictures were actually taken from.  We e-mailed the pictures to my personal email and I saved it as a PowerPoint and zoomed in on it.  I had to brighten the contrast on it in PowerPoint because it was dark outside. (I will try to email you the pictures....I want you to see them.) ((NUFORC Note:  We have not seen the photo, at the time of this writing.  PD))",

My wife and niece watched too.  It was hoovering and moving a little bit left and right (south and north).  I couldn't make out very well the shape, which looked like a to spheres attached one to the other.  The color appeared to be white and silver.  It was very far high in the sky.    That day there was a good amount of commercial airplanes flying from East to West, south of my observation point.  It doesn't happened every day to see that many planes in that point at that time, it might be a route that is taken due to weather or else, and by the way the weather was perfect that morning.  Anyway, at a certain point I am not sure where it went but it was not there any more.   I don't know what I was looking at, my niece (21 y o) doesn't either, but she says she saw a UFO.  It was a UFO to me, at least, I don't want to jump to conclusions.    Considering the shape (to spheres attached one to the other) and the fact that it was not moving and it appeared to reflect light (at that time 8 am the sun was low in the eastern sky and was shining toward west hitting this object which was reflecting the light).  It was very difficult to spot, I saw it by accident.  I don't expect many people having seen it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

      "story": "I observed a moving light through an aircraft's window over Atlanta, Ga. I was on Delta Airlines Flight 1667 flying from Atlanta, GA, to Myrtle Beach, S.C.  The aircraft was a MD-88 and I was sitting in seat 19E on the starboard side of the aircraft, several rows forward of the wing, which I could see on the right side of my window when I leaned forward.  We took off an hour late at around 22:29.  There was an overcast of Cirrus-stratus or Alto-stratus clouds.  The full moon was not visible through this layer.  There were no lower clouds and city lights were plainly visible without obstruction during the initial climb out after takeoff.  There were no reading lights in use near me.  There were also no electronics in use with illuminated screens nearby that would have reflected on the inside of the window. Shortly after takeoff the aircraft leveled out and the lights of the city were plainly visible with a definite darker area extending out to the horizon visible under a slightly lighter sky over that.   At this point I was looking down at the city lights, when I noticed a light separate itself from the rest and begin to move.  It was a banana yellow color and was moving upward at a slow and steady pace.  There were no other details to it.  I could not judge its distance from us.   As it moved, it appeared to be heading on an opposite course to ours and was climbing at an angle of approximately forty five degrees.  From my perspective it moved from the lower left of the window to its upper right corner where I lost it to view.   The light became obscured by the leading edge of the wing and then reappeared over the rear upper edge of the wing or wingtip.  All this time which was probably a minute or so the light did not change in brightness or flicker.  The color stayed the sa! me and so did its speed of ascent.  I was unable to observe the object further as it went out of my limited field of view even by shifting my position. I don't know if anyone else on the aircraft saw this.  There was no apparent reaction. The young man sitting next to me on the left was listening to music and not looking out the window.  This whole thing occurred to quickly to try to get anyone's attention. During the initial takeoff before we leveled out there were other aircraft visible.  This light or object did not exhibit their characteristics.  I have flown numerous times at night and have seen plenty of aircraft leaving or arriving at airports.  This was not one of them. Its apparent point of origin was not from any airport. It was an urban environment.  Shortly after this we began to ascend again and banked for a course change.  I checked my watch and it was now 22:35. I am sixty two years old, male, and was travelling alone returning home from a family related trip.  I am a retired social worker and business manager.  I am an amateur astronomer and avid sky watcher.  I have no clue what this was.  I only know what it wasn't.  I considered raising this issue with the pilot upon landing at Myrtle Beach, but decided to avoid that and take this approach instead.  I don't know how he would have reacted, but I did speak with him about the natural fireworks of distant thunderstorms visible to our south during the flight at higher altitude which he was also quite enthusiastic about.",

Long story short, after cruising through several pages of image search for \"alien grey sculpture\" (assuming a high quality sculpture would be a great prop for hoaxing) I found an image that was from what I could tell identical to the \"alien\" in the photos just flipped horizontally.  I did a reverse image search, and found this image on a post dating back to 2008 as just a generic example image of a \"grey\".

I shined a staples laser pointer at it, and it slowly flew south west over the city and banked out of view to the West.

      "story": "Bright orbs in triangle formation slowly fly over Atlanta. I was on my back deck with my mother and law assembling a pergola.  Something caught my mother-in-law's and my eyes in the sky in the eastern direction.  What we witnessed were four extremely bright white orbs grouped in a triangular formation.  One at each point of triangle, one perfectly in the center.   The formation was slowly moving southeast completely silent.  I thought it was airplanes flying in formation, but no sound, no exhaust trail.  The orbs were also shimmering, almost like they were changing colors from pink to green and bright white.   As they crossed the sky, they changed formation to single file.",

Around 4-5 pm in the middle of an amazing song, everyone was enthralled by, someone next to me pointed to the sky and said balloons.   At first we saw a few balloons...orange blue yellow clearly balloons that colored with strings on them...I turned around 30 seconds later.  And what seemed like a bunch of balloons behind the close balloons all of sudden were white dots floating up down left and right...  Not a ton of movement.  It seemed as if they were watching/listening/feeling the festival.   I've never seen anything like this so and I've always been interested in these kinds of things, so I decided to report it.",

      "story": "Triangle shaped black craft spotted near Atlanta, Georgia. While flying from Atlanta, Georgia, to Minneapolis, MN, spotted a solid mat black triangle shaped craft flying at a speed of approximately Mach 2 at an altitude of 31,000 feet.   The aircraft was  flying towards the commercial aircraft I was in and passed on the right side of the aircraft approximately 500 yds away and 1000 ft lower than my aircraft's altitude.   Triangle shaped craft bore no markings and no stabilizers or visible fins.  The craft appeared to be smaller than most fighters or personal aircraft and appeared to not have a cockpit of any sort.   The craft appeared off the forward right side of the aircraft I was in and then disappeared under the right wing. As far as I know I am the only one to see the craft.   I am in the military and I study aircraft that are operated by the U.S. Military.  This craft does not match any current operational military aircraft. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I did not inform the aircraft crew of the sighting.  For some reason the thought never occurred to me.  I have done some research however and I have found a prototype aircraft that is very similar to the aircraft I spotted.  The craft that I found is the Boeing Phantom Ray which was produced 7 years ago in St. Louis, Missouri.  I hope this helps some.  Thank you for your consideration of my report and timely reply.

As my greyhound bus was entering Atlanta, GA, from Tampa, FL, (while escaping hurricane Irma), I saw it fairly low in the sky and close enough to see clearly.  It seemed to be hovering in one spot and it looked like it could have been larger than a passenger aircraft.  There was no distinguishable front or end to the craft, it looked as though the ends of the cigar shaped craft were flat.   It did start to look like it was drifting farther away from the greyhound bus, but not because were were on the highway, but because it was drifting directly away from the highway, going Eastward, even though it was pointing North/South.",

The light was like a shooting star but about 20 times as bright.  It was descending rapidly at a slight angle, and disappeared behind the trees.  This was definitely not a shooting star, it was moving more slowly and deliberately than that and was too bright.  As I kept driving there was an accident that had just happened on I-20 not far from where the light was headed, although the light appeared to be heading more south away from the interstate.  Also, the trajectory was as of a plane crashing at a steep angle, or a flare coming down.",
