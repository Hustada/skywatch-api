      "story": "Dim star that moved sharply,  and intentionally At approximately 3:15AM on a spring morning, in 1998, I stepped outside from my assigned housing unit at Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Norfolk to have a cigarette.  I looked straight up, because the facility is well lighted, both inside and out, making star gazing less than spectacular.  I happened to focus on what I believed to be two ordinary stationary stars. One star was of medium brightness, and the other star, at the 3:00 o'clock position, was very dim, just half as bright, and about the distance of a quarter held at arms lenght from the other star.  Suddenly, the dim star, just a speck of light, made sharp, angular manuevers, all within close proximity to the other star.  I remember exclaiming to myself \"holy mackerel, that thing is moving\".  I nearly ran inside to get my work partner, but I was afraid to lose track of it, so I just kept watching. Then the pin prick of light made a circular move, which brought it to the opposite side of the stationary star, to the 9:00 o'clock position. These moves only lasted 4 to 5 seconds, maybe a moment more or less. It hesitated for a split second, and then headed south.   I had the presense of mind to start counting: one-one thousand, two-one thousand, three-one thousand, four-one thousand, five-one thousand, six-one thousand, gone!!!  over the southern horizon, where I lost sight of it at about 15 degrees over the horizon.  This speck of light had no sound and no tail.  It never flared brighter or dimmer. This speck of light, which I perceived to be very high in the atmosphere, crossed half the night sky in six seconds!!  It did not blink.   After making its manuevers and going south it did not accelerate, but simlpy arrived at its intended speed and went absolutely straight.   This once in a lifetime observation has annoyed me since it happened and I'm pleased to report it. I have since retired from that line of work.  I look forward to spending many pleasant summer nights observing the the night sky and watching for stars moving in ways that neither the stars or our known military craft should be able to do.

I kept looking the sound went away and I saw a cigar shaped aircraft with NO WINGS fly from  Northeast direction toward the Southeast.  The craft was very high but I could clearly see separation between the front half and a dark band and it looked as if the back half was separate but attached sort of like two short cigar shapes made of what I would think of a dull aluminum.  There was a large dark band at the rear of the first part.  It was really high and I could see it clearly.  No wings and it was going what I would think of as slow and I kept the object in my view  thinking I could get my cell phone and have enough time to get a picture.  I looked down and looked up it was gone it should have been in my view at least 30 seconds more the way it was moving.  If it was a plane it wouldn't have been gone that fast.  It just didn't seem to move across the sky that fast it was a clear sky.  I put my head down and looked back up in a spit second and it was gone.  The change in speed was not something a regular plane could have accomplished.   Which brings me back to it had no wings! This is the second time I have seen something in the sky from my back yard.  I saw a sphere a few years ago around this time of year.  Crazy isn't it. I am just a regular person that believes in God and as God is my witness I saw what doesn't seem to be anything I have ever seen on TV before.  I really don't like star wars type of stuff so I don't know if it is something that the movies has copied.",

As I continue to drive, I observed this object in the sky.  I could not stop, because I was in the far left lane, and traffic was heavy that morning.   At first, I thought it was a helicopter, shining it searchlight, but this flourescent light was too soft (I wasn't blinded by it).  This light shone exactly like a strobing light, but no flicker was present when it caught my attention in the sky. This object appeared to be a long cylinder (cigar shaped).  As I continue to drive and look at the flourescent light, it was very soft to my eyes.  I also caught a glimpse of a red light under the belly of the object (center of the object).  I tried to determine if this was a helicopter, but I would know if this was a helicopter by the sound they make, but this object produced no sound.

Earlier this month I am not sure of the exact date I was cleaning my kitchen island and happened to look down my hall. I saw this light. I wouldn\u2019t call it a ball of light.  I would say it was like large sausage shaped lights entwined into each other it was a sunny day and my hallway is dark it came from my bathroom, I would not say it floated it seemed to have a motion like the sausage lights were moving within the shape of a rounded off cube.  There were no hard edges and the lights within the shape moved as it was going from one room to the next. At first thought I thought it was bluish lights on some of these sausage shapes and some were perfectly white.  Luminescent.  It seemed to hover for a second and I had a strange feeling it was intelligent. I know that people are starting to think I am crazy.  That is okay by me.  I just know that someone out there has seen something like this. I have also had some crazy stuff happening at home.  Something said something in my ear while I was lying down.   My dog who was beside me heard it and started to bark like there was someone in the room.  It was loud and I could feel it down my ear canal.  I have been researching to see if someone had died in this house but I have come up with no explanation. I think all this started to happen in the last few years when I saw a round object in the day sky go over my backyard. It had a military plane a few hundred feet above it. My husband was in the living room with me when I watched the handle on my sun porch move and the door opened.  He heard the handle and went over to check it.  No explanation for that either.  I am getting scared as I am alone a lot. I am not crazy.  I am just an average person who is an open book and doesn't care if you believe me.  But I do think it should be documented.

We were in a small covered gazebo talking and laughing when we witnessed what we thought was a flash of lighting directly overhead (we heard nothing).  The weather is of concern to us because we are forecasters so we all stepped out of the covered area to see where the lightning could have come from.  There were almost clear skies and no storm clouds in any quadrants.  It could not have been lightning.  I went inside while to others headed to a lookout above the building where they claimed to have seen a ball of light in the distance take off out of sight in the blink of an eye.  I cannot confirm the second part but the first I was there for.  About 20 minutes after coming back into the office local news stations from Marland to North Carolina began reporting similar sightings.  Some interesting facts that occured just after the incident are millitary aircraft taking off and seemingly patroling the area. I later called the observation tower near the airfielf where I work and asked if they had witnessed anything and the lady said she could not confirm or deny anything at the moment.

And it didnt fit in any aircraft traffic pattern for the bases and it was for sure not a flare.

They can be best described as amber colored, yet bigger and closer than (in earths atmosphere) regular stars in the sky that moved very slowly.  As I filmed I noticed they would move closer towards me, gain altitude and they would randomly fade out one by one.  As they were fading below them through the trees I kept seeing more appear sometimes 2-3 at a time that were much brighter at they're lower alt! itudes and seemed to fade as they climbed in altitude.  These objects made absolutely no sounds, and moved in no erratic motions, yet didn't have any characteristics of any man made aircraft I have ever witnessed.

She was looking up at the stars over the airport when she yelled at me to pull over.  I did, and she then pointed out a blue light in the sky over the tree-line.  The light was small at this distance, it hovered in place for a few seconds, then moved right, and immediately reversed direction.  She started filming on her iPhone. I then decided to try and get closer to where it seemed to be hovering.  I sped down a few streets trying to narrow down its location.  We ended up near the Norfolk ice rink, where we found other people filming this light. We pulled over behind one car with two guys filming the light, and there was also a guy out of his van which he left in the middle of the road.  There were 5 of us standing there watching this light hover directly above us, slowly moving towards the woods.  The light was constantly changing direction above us.  After about 3 minutes of filming, the light moved towards the woods and that was last we saw of it. \tWe could not make out the shape of the object due to the night sky being the only point of reference behind the light.  We could make out four bright lights that seemed to be on the bottom of the object.  Two were blue and two were red, giving off a purplish hue in between.  The lights were in a square formation.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the object.  Due to all of these factors and attributes, we could not determine the size or distance of the object.  It could have been large and far away, or small and up close.  The whole encounter lasted approximately 15 minutes, with roughly 3 minutes of recorded video.",

The boat was doing work ups getting ready for deployment, we had a full deployment crew. Me and a couple of other ET's heard some of the watch standers on the island talking about seeing something crazy, they said something about trying lock on to it with the Nato Sea Sparrow Director's onto the object.  Me and a handful of guys on the night shift ran up to the O-10 where the watch standers were watching it.  They had the mounted Binoculars trained on the object.  I thought they were mistaking two stars one of which looked like a pulsar (due to my pretty extensive knowledge of astronomy).  The object then appeared between the two stars again, the other guys saw the object as well.  We all thought we might be imagining it, asked each other a couple of times if they saw it too.  We all agreed that it was there. When I first noticed it, I thought I was imagining it.  How could a star disappear then reappear right in front of me?  I watched it through the mounted binoculars changing colors between blue, white, purple, and pink at high speed, it kept pulsing. It seemed to stay motionless, the problem was that the altitude was just high for any of us to make out exactly what it looked like, from our vantage point we could see that it may have been hovering and possibly moving but just can't say for sure.   After about 5 minutes of viewing the object as we were all trying to get a look at it, a bright flash filled the sky in the location of the object, it looked like it shot with an incredible speed and was gone.  We were traveling North, the object was northeast of our Northerly heading.  Our speed was approximately 15 to 20 knots. The three watch standers at there post reported that two similar objects had come out of the main relatively stationary object and then rejoined the main object. During my time watching the object CIC (Combat Information Center) was trying to get a radar lock on the object with the Nato Sea Sparrow Missile Directors.  The directors (which are radar directors, fire control radar) kept trying to lock onto the object then it would drop back down to the horizon, the OS's (Operation Specialists) trying to drive the director back there again.  Every time they would drive to get a lock the lock would fail and the director would be driven back down again.  It seemed to me that the object was overriding the directors drive control or that the radar receiver was being over powered and being forced by internal programming to protect its receiver, (to get away from the source of the electromagnetic radiation) it could have been over-driven by the object being to close but more than likely the object was jamming the radar.  I can't say weather it was jamming the object passively or actively, just that the radar was being jammed. After the sighting I checked the SPN-43 and SPS-49 radar in CATCC, neither of them had a radar return, although at that altitude the chances of a radar return are very slim. I tried to report it to my chain of command, they laughed at me and said that we didn't see anything.  We probably just excited, I didn't expect that reaction especially when CIC reacted the way they did.",

The craft was flying in a southerly direction from directly over the waterside area of downtown Norfolk, proceeding towards and over the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.   It was a beautiful night and the skies were very clear, as we could see many of the star constellation.  We were enjoying the night talking about the two CH-60 helicopters that had flown overhead thirty minutes prior, when we spotted six faint orange or yellowish colored lights in the sky, judging only from its lights; as we could not see any structural definition, we believe based on the formation of lights that it was chevron shaped.  As the craft flew directly overhead of us, the faint lights were ! no longer visible and the craft was completely transparent, and did not have any discernible aircraft marking lights; which was very strange considering the fact it was flying through an extremely busy corridor.  We noticed a few other planes flying over in their normal landing procedure, strobes on as well as landing lights lit up, as we commonly see in the skies near Norfolk International airport.  I am retired military and my training as a stinger missile gunner required me to be able to identify all aircraft by their silhouette at any angle,  This was not any known aircraft I had ever seen, perhaps the most striking aspect of the incident was the complete silence surrounding it.  In viewing several commercial airliners after the incident occurred making their normal approaches at lower altitudes and taking note of the size they appeared based on our perspective, we estimate the size craft to be about 3-4 times larger than a normal commercial jet-liner.   The entire scene last! ed about 30 seconds. I have never witnessed anything like this! before, and I cannot even begin to  imagine the sort of technology needed to make a craft completely transparent, as well as totally silent.",

      "story": "My fianc\u00e9 and I witnessed a solid red light, moving quickly through the sky, and stopping to hover at irregular intervals.  The red light was bright and steady\u2013not flashing/blinking like normal aircraft lights.  During one of the stopped/hovering moments, a greenish light began to intermittently blink on and off somewhat similar to aircraft light but with a slower transition between on/off. During one of its hovers, the red light seemed to split into 2 red lights, at which point the green strobing light was turned off.  A plane passed by in the general vicinity, but above the light, and it seemed to react by suddenly dropping altitude very quickly.  Once the plane had passed, the 2nd red light disappeared/turned off and the green strobe resumed.  The light then drifted slowly in the sky momentarily and then accelerated towards downtown Norfolk at about the speed of a helicopter until it was out of sight. It could have possibly been a drone but the abnormal flight behavior, time of night, speed and distance covered made me skeptical of that. It\u2019s hard to estimate the altitude of the light, however it was well below the clouds and normal flight paths of aircraft in the area.

I was in my backyard with my 2 year old son around sunset, and we were looking at the moon, when we noticed in the sky at high altitude in close proximity to the moon (about 4 o'clock) a cylindrical type object with long panels extending the length of both sides of it that appeared to be hovering in the sky.   At first I thought it was a plane but I observed no contrails and then thought that maybe it was a satelite or the ISS, however after about 5 minutes, it vanished from view.   There were no clouds in the sky and the object did not move from its location, it literally just vanished.",
