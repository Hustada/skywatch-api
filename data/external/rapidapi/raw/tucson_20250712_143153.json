Anyway we noticed a darting object and my friend said/asked if we saw that? We agreed. We layed down on the ground and watched literally 100's (trying not to exaggerate), objects flying in and out of this star? Whatever, it was a Mother Craaft we don't know but we watched for a long time. It was wild. These objects had no spitting out like and explosion. They DARTED  in out up down. There was no rythme . Just as if they were going in and out of a gas station. I cannot remember the year but my friend can exactly cuz her b-day was coming up. I want to say 94/95/96 Can be more specific if this interests you for info.

What we saw and for how long:  We both saw five goldish looking lights, about 40 degrees above the horizon lined up horizontally but tilted slightly,  The left most light was significantly brighter (about as bright as a car headlight from a quarter mile away) than the others.  The distance was hard to judge but I would guess between 2 and 3 miles.  They appeared to be drifting slowly to the west (left) and all of a sudden they just disappeared, as if a light switch was turned off. We saw these lights for about 10 seconds before they disappeared. What we didn\u2019t see: We didn\u2019t see the lights appear, other than when we noticed them, so we can\u2019t vouch for how long they were visible. We did not see a craft or crafts that may have been emitting the light.  There were no blinking lights associated with them, as seen on normal aircraft; in fact as we continued to drive north, about a mile and a half past the original sighting, we did not see any aircraft in the area at all.  The lights did not behave like fireworks, military aircraft flairs, drones or shooting stars, all of which we have seen many times. About us: I am an Engineering Technician/Metrologist and my wife is a teacher.  We are both sky watchers and have witnessed many unusual things in both the daylight and night skies.  We both try to think of logical explanations for anything that we experience but we can\u2019t explain what we saw.",

We lived in North Tucson and my friend's house was in a pretty undeveloped area, so it was very dark out.  I was riding in the front passenger seat when I looked out the window and saw bizarre lights in the sky, toward the north.  I pointed this out to my friends and we pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road to watch.  It was a formation of 4 bright white lights, they were in a crescent shape and they didn't blink or move.  We had no clue what we were seeing; as we got out of the vehicle to look further, the formation suddenly changed shape in one very fluid motion to where the lights were in a very large triangular shape, the fourth of the lights down next to the bottom right corner of the triangle.  The lights were still white, we didn't hear any sounds and they didn't blink.  After a few moments the formation shape changed once again, the lights moved into a straight line and CHANGED COLOR from white to red.  They then started moving in a line very quickly in a south-west direction (I think), before suddenly all disappearing at once.  We were pretty scared at this point, we jumped back in the car and peeled out toward home!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Dual Diamond Swinging Kite Object(s) I've been trying to find out if there have ever been reports of the type of object we saw on the date above, and decided to file a report while I'm here since the event continues to perplex me to this day.  At about 4:30 in the afternoon on or about March 25 or 2005, my freind and I were out in my backyeard. I was sitting at my gold panning tub while he was looking into my side yard. My freind told me \"You need to check this out.\" I thought he was looking at some flaw on my roof or a cooler leak etc...I just made some joke about not wanting to see whatever it was.  Then he repeated in a rather puzzled but stern voice...\"No, I mean it, come here and check this out!\"  I got up reluctantly and asked what he was looking at. He said \"I'm not sure what the heck it is. I thought it was a parachutis in trouble but it just doesn't look right for that.\" He pointed in the general direction where he was looking. At first I didn't see anything, but then out from behind a tele pole I got my first glimpse of it. I tried to focus on ths object to tell what it was. Because of it's motion in the first few seconds of my seeing the object, I thought it was a kite. There appeared to be a tringular shaped object on top, with a smaller one below it. The lower craft appeared to be \"tethered to the upper, as it was moving back and forth in a pendulus swinging motion.\" Initially it looked like a kite. However after watching it a few more seconds it became apparent that whatever this was was moving across the sky far too fast for a kite busted off it's string. Also, the pendulus motion in a constant back and forth arc below the upper object was very precise and rythmic in pattern.  The movement is really what made the sighting \"eerie/odd/unexplainable\" as with each cycle of back and forth motion (8 o'clock to 4 o'clock), the object(s) paused, then elevated and began another swinging cycle. At the end of each back/forth cycle, it paused, and elevated. I observed this happen aout 4 or 5 times and then the oddest thing happened...the little object on the bottom went in a full circle all the way around the top object in a matter of a second. It started in it's normal 8 o'clock position, but then did a complete loop around the upper diamond object and stopped on a dime in the 4:00 position, and then began another back/forth swing.  I ran through the house as the trees in my neighbors yard were now in the path of the object. I jumped on top of my freind's truck to see if I could find the object again from my front yard but it was no where to be seen.  There was no sound, no lights. The onjects were perhaps shimmering a bit, but the odd thing is I'm not sure if that was from it's reflective qualities or a \"blur\" as the objects were never crisply defined in my sight. I recall really trying to focus on them because of this aspect of their appearance, but to no avail. I could tell they were diamon in shape, with the shorter axis of the diamonds at 12 and 6 o'clock. The objects seemed to be tan to dark grey and varied in hue over time.  My freind and I remain pretty convinced this was something that defies any objects we could think of that might exhibit this sort of free flight. Again, it was the precise period of the swing, the repetitive precision of the starting and stopping points of the swing, the vertical elevation in between each cycle, and the swiftness of the loop around the upper object with it's rapid halt that made this sighting truly bizzarre to us. It's the only thing I've ever seen in my 48 years that still has me scratching my head. I'm a bit mad that I didn't write everything down that day, as I struggle to recall if I actually saw a tehter, or if it was just the precision of the movement of the lower object that implied such a tether (sorry) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As it glowed brighter it began to move much faster and changed direction to the due east. As it neared us we noted it made NO sound.It began to move over the Catalina mountains and 2 jets from Davis -Monthan air base began to give chase after it. The object changed colors again from orange to white on top and red below.It got much closer as it again changed direction and headed south.The jets were not able to keep up with it.The object sped soouth and suddenly shot out of sight.This lasted 1-2 minutes.We kept looking over the mountains and talking about what we had just seen and the object returned .It was to the north over the Catalinas.

I looked at the light with my binoculars and i could tell how the light would change shape from round to triangular and then from triangular to round. The light would change shapes constantly. The light then started traveling south again and stopped aproximately above Aviation and Country Club. A helicopter started circling the object (for about 3 minutes) with the spotlight on the object. After the 3 minutes with the helicopter circling the object, the red light turned off and completely dissapeared in less than a second.

I called my grandsons attention to it and we now watched it earnestly.I was so absorbed I didn't even think of the camera. The object had a dim white outline of lights.It did not have the usual strobes and green/red flashers of conventional aircraft. Since it was silent and unconvential I was now getting pretty excited and so was my grandson. The object continued northwest and began to fly low over the Catalina Mountains.(highest peak around 9,000 ft) As it traveled it began to pickup speed and suddenly it was joined by an F-14 out of Davis Monthan airbase.It appeared to be in pursuit of the craft.The craft began to glow orange,started heading south and 2 more jets scrambled out of the base after it. The object turned blue,changed to a large triangle shape and shot upward. The F-14s stayed with it on its tail and both sides. It then began a sharp fast climb and in a few seconds it left the fighters and was gone. I am now a beleiver in UFO's as this was truly an unidentified flying object.

I am unsure of the exact time but it happened just a few hours before the funeral which was scheduled for 2pm so I estimate that it was around 10am but it could have been 10:30am. My mother may remember what time it happened. My husband and I had a room on third floor on the north side of the building and my mother, grandmother and a friend had a room on third floor on the south side of the building. We were over in my mother's and grandmother's room visiting when my mother said she needed to get something out of her rental car and wanted me to go out with her because she wanted to tell me something. The car she rented was parked in the parking lot on the north side of the building right near the entrance. In the late morning this side is in the shadow of the hotel. The lobby had entrances on both sides of the building. So we took the elevator down and then my mother told me what she wanted to tell me. Then she proceeded to look in the car for something. She didn\u2019t find it in the trunk so she opened the front passenger side door and was leaning into the car looking through a bag of stuff. I stood next to the car with my back to the building looking north. As I stood there, motion to my right caught my attention and I turned to look and saw what looked like a bubble, like the bubbles kids blow from a soap solution. It was traveling from the direction of the freeway towards the back of the building. It came down the aisle the way a car would have except that it was floating about 6 ft above the ground. As it got closer I realized it wasn\u2019t a kids bubble but then I remembered that rubbery kind that the kids blow through a tube but as it got closer yet then I knew it wasn\u2019t that either. It just glided along and then just as it passed the back of my mother\u2019s rental car and up to the sidewalk leading into the hotel, it suddenly turned to the left like it was go! ing towa rds the entrance to the hotel but then it turned again and headed right for me but just as it got near me it also increased in altitude a few inches. So I was just standing there trying to figure out what it was and I finally said to my mother, \u201cLook at this\u201d and she backed away from the car and stood up and looked and she didn\u2019t see it approach us and so her perception was off and she thought it was larger but further away and said, \u201cOh, a kids balloon\u201d and I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s closer\u201d and she said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right\u201d and then she started talking up a storm about what it might be. We both sensed an intelligence about it and felt as though it were looking at us. As we stood there staring at it I sort of heard in my head the name of my brother. It was like the orb communicated telepathically. The hair stood up on the back of my neck at that point because it scared me but I then discounted it and thought, \u2018how could this be my brother and what would would an orb have to do with my brother.\u2019 Then I remembered something my husband had watched just a couple weeks or so before about spirit orbs near battle grounds. The orb was about the size of a softball or slightly larger and it was pearly white with a little discoloration on the bottom just to the left (from my viewing perspective). After hovering there for a while then it reversed the original flight path until it got to the back of the car and then it floated along the drivers side of the car back towards the hotel and then went up and over the top of the hotel. We lost sight of it after that and so my mother hurried up and shut the car door and we raced through the lobby of the hotel to go out the other door on the south side to see if we could see it again. We did see it again. It seemed to light up or catch the sunlight differently sometimes because sometimes we could see it very well as though it were a light and other times we couldn\u2019t. Then finally we couldn\u2019t see it anymore. It was heading sort of southwest towards some mountains off in the distance! while g aining quite a bit of altitude. When we couldn\u2019t see it anymore we headed back upstairs and as we stepped off the elevator on third floor, my husband was standing there. He didn\u2019t know what was taking me and my mother so long and was about to come down and look for us to find out. So we told him what we had seen and right away he said that it was my brother. I don\u2019t know what I saw except that it showed intelligence and watched us and knew the name of my brother. I want to know what that was and why it happened just before my brother's funeral and how it knew we would be there and how it knew my brother's name. It is creepy when anyone knows stuff about you when they shouldn't.",

My first impression was that it was a weather balloon, but it remained overhead for almost an hour with little descernable motion. I pondered whether it was a distant supernova, but have heard nothing over the astronomy news. It looked to be above the troposphere. I say this only as a former meteorologist. There is the slight chance it was a passing asteriod, which I have heard rumors of, but am not sure it was visible during the day.  The little motion I observed was in a NNE direction by no more than 5 degrees for duration of sighting. Eventually, I had to get back to surveying the area, and had to step in a building for an hour or so. The light was not visible when I tried to reaquire it an hour later.  My partner observed the same anomoly, but thought nothing of it. We have not mentioned it since.  Local military air traffic showed no interest in it, either. I watched numerous flights depart the Air Force base only to practice formations and usual touch and go's.  I have released countless weather balloons and tracked their paths across the sky. Never have I observed one shoot straight up, nor remain relatively motionless for an hour. Jet streams and upper level winds usually take the balloon out of sight, or the balloon pops when reaching high altitude.  I do not think it was a UFO (ET), a star, nor a balloon. Stars move west. This object drifted no more than 5 degrees NNE in an hour. Balloons pop or move rapidly to the east after reaching altitudes of 30,000ft and up. A near Earth asteriod is my best guess.",

      "story": "A fast traveling object that covered great (irregular) distances while blinking multiple colors extremely fast. My girlfriend and I were driving home from a SubWay restaurant when I saw what appeared to be a malfunctioning airplane. It\u2019s hard to stress in words how distinctly different from an airplane this was, and when I saw it my mouth dropped and I immediately pulled over to the side of the road. I live at the base of a mountain (the outskirts of the city) and was heading north-east when I saw it. After I pulled over to the side of the road and I pointed out what I saw to my girlfriend and she became as awed as I was. Now that I had stopped moving I was able to properly asses what I was looking at. It was a ball of light about four times as big as a star but smaller than an airplane light that was blinking/flashing multiple colors (I\u2019m talking almost every color imaginable) about 10 times per every 1 time that an airplanes light blinks. Basically, if an airplane blinks 2 times a second, this object was blinking about 20-30 times a second in alternating colors like red, blue, green, purple\u2026etc in a hard to catch order (if any). However, that wasn\u2019t the half of it\u2026 Its one thing to see colorful flashing (strobe-light like) light, but it\u2019s another to see this object\u2019s crazy movement in the sky. It came from the north-east heading north-west in an irregular, non-linear path that consisted of circles and zigzags with behaviors similar to that of a firefly. It was moving nothing like an airplane/satellite/whatever, and occasionally consisted of dives that dropped the object hundreds of feet in order to regain its altitude only seconds later. At this point I was freaked out enough and decided to call the police for help\u2026 I called 911, who forwarded me to the Local Police department where they took my information and told me to keep my eye on the object. I continued to watch the object in its irregular path towards the west when it suddenly seemed to stop in one location for about 10 minutes! It seemed to stay in the same vicinity but make loops, dives and etc, all covering great distances in very short periods of time. Wanting to contact a UFO hotline, I got into my car and drove the remainder of the distance home. When I got home I did a quick search to get to www.nuforc.org and call the hotline support. I talked to someone for a good 5-10 mins about the object I could now barely see in the distance. He told me to call up friends closer to the object (that was now far west) to see if they could spot the object as well. As he was telling me this I noticed a helicopter flying over my neighborhood (with a spotlight) at the intersection I had told the police that I had witnessed the object (I don\u2019t know if that was a coincidence or what). I later drove back to the original place I had seem the object, where I called my friends on the other side of town. They all couldn\u2019t see the object because they lived more into the city and had a harder time seeing stars (because of the many lights) let alone a weird blinking thing. I eventually drove home and filled out this report as the man on the hotline had told me to do.",

I assumed that a jet from the airport was making a turn and it's headlights was shinning on us, so I didn't  turn to look at it , because i didn't want to be blinded by it's light. after a couple of seconds & the light didn't go away I turned to see why, just as I did  it came in view. it looked like a giant round sphere of fire. It was approxamatly 1000 to 2000 feet in elivation, one half mile south of us, it only took 2 seconds to travel from our local to the top of the south end of the tucson mountains, which it just bearly cleared. It was at least as big or bigger than the U of A football stadium , which seats 50,000 people. it was totaly silent & there was no sonic boom or exhaust trail. being only about an hour after dark in the tucson area, there must have been at least 100,000 people outside , not facing north who couldn't possibly have not seen it.  for the next two days I monitered the tv news, radio news & newspaper looking for reports, but saw none whatsoever. I researched ball lighting & found it couldn't be that. nothing in science explained what it could have been .   a year or two later the same phenomenon was reported over southern california, heading from southwest to the northeast toword  area 51. the one i saw was heading basically east to west slightly southeast to northwest.  a couple of years later I was watching a taped video lecture of a young german scientist giving a lecture about WWII Nazi UFO technology & in it he spoke about a perticular sphereicle  craft  that would give the apperance of a giant ball of fire. that was the only thing i have ever heard that sounds like an explanation for what  me & my friends saw. . thank you.

Okay, I'm standing out on the patio, smoking a cigarette and up in the sky I see these lights. Here's as best a description I can give:It appeared in the southern sky. the lights looked like twinkling stars almost or like plane lights but they would get bright for just a second and then disappear completely (normal planes do not do that you can still see the plane). There would be like 4 or 5 of them going off but not in any sort of order. The area they covered was pretty big, like the area of 5 or 6 planes but there wasn't a distinguishable shape like a circle etc. Really you could not see anything behind the lights it was the lights themselves that let you know something was there.It could not have been different planes either because of the way the lights were moving the plane would have to have the ability to zig up and down and back and forward at a rate of nano seconds. The whole thing was moving west at a pretty rapid clip. I called my husband out, who was annoyed I took him away from a show but as soon as he saw it he also commented, \"What the hell is that?\" I was speaking to a friend on the phone who lives a few blocks away. I asked her to go outside and look at the sky. She and her son went outside,her son said it looked like asteroid dust. He is 13. We had to run out to the parking lot to see past the building in front of us but by the time we got to the parking lot it was gone. We live near an air force base so we are used to seeing planes in the sky all the time. This was NOTHING like anything I've ever seen flying in the sky before. Hope this helps.",

      "story": "A daylight sighting of a white sphere near a chemtrail over Tucson, AZ was observed from schoolyard by parents and teachers. While picking up my son from school near the intersection of 6th Ave. and Speedway Blvd. I looked up at the chemtrails from the school steps leading from the playground to the building.  I had been pointing them out to my mother throughout the day.  My mother was with me, visiting from out of town.  I noticed a white sphere next to a chemtrail and became very excited because I am involved in the UFO phenomenon and I hadn\u2019t had a sighting in a while, much less with so many potential witnesses, especially Mom.  So I announced to the teachers and parents on the schoolyard that I was seeing a UFO and they all saw it as well.  There was one other parent, a male, who later told me he had had a major sighting in Oregon before.  Two other teachers saw it and another parent.  I don\u2019t remember if my mom could see it.  She doesn\u2019t have great vision.  It was five minutes after noon.  The UFO was very high, about 75 degrees in the sky.  I was looking north and the object was just west of the Santa Catalina Mountains.  It was initially between two chemtrails, but then got lost in the one on the left.  It reappeared again.  Eventually it was clearly seen again below the chemtrail.  I now wonder if the object was stationary and the chemtrail was drifting.  I wish I had sited the object relative to a non-moving object like a telephone pole.  I took a picture of  it with my mom\u2019s disposable camera, but I haven\u2019t developed the picture yet and I doubt it will show up as it was very small and high up.  The two parents and I moved out into the parking lot and continued to observe the object for another five minutes, perhaps.  I used my cell phone to call George Parks of MUFON (I\u2019m a member) to tell him about it.  He didn\u2019t see it as I had trouble telling him where to look relative to his location.  After I hung up with him the parents and I drove off in our separate cars.  The whole event lasted maybe under ten minutes.",

We were hiking in the area near Old Tucson Studios with Golden Gate Mountain in the background. Approximately 9:00 a.m. September 11, 2007 a golden triangular object hovered west of Tucson, Arizona over the Tucson Mountains between Golden Gate Mountain and Old Tucson Studios.  The object was as big as a dime with arm extended, on a clear day with few clouds. The clouds closest to the golden triangular object were most brilliant and vivid compared to the other clouds furthest away from it. There appeared to be a dome in the center of the golden triangular object with the sun\u2019s shadow visible on one side.  Also the triangle reshaped into a golden half moon or dome before vanishing into thin air. Image of the golden triangular object was captured on digital camera and printed on 8x10 enlargement glossy Fuji photo paper at a local Walgreens by my friend, a Tucsonian, who immediately recognized it as a UFO.  And there was a 2 for $5.00 sale on the 8x10\u2019s.",

I asked my mother who was sitting next to me in the vehicle if she knew what it was, of coarse she did not.  We thought it might have been the north star however we were not headed north and the light seemed to get big, then we thought maybe it was a satellite however even satellite don\u2019t get larger . What ever it was, seemed to stay in one place, it just seemed to get bigger and brighter.  My mom and I was talking and she told me something shocking, that she believe  that she actually saw a alien,  it was in a canister  which was completely sealed , the canister was army green with army wording, stating confidential and also had numbers and letter on it.  There was a glass like opening, on the side of it, she was able to see it, and she said it was in this green liquid and that this creature had huge eyes on it diamond chapped face two hole she thought could have been for a nose yet there were no mouth on it.  The thing was very small no bigger than 18 inches; it fit some what loose in the canister.  It had legs and arms.  I asked if she thought it was real, she said she believed it was because of the canister and were the canister was found. The canister was ceiled with tracking number on it she believed it also had a sort of lock on it.   The thing is locked away, the person that has it is afraid to come forward with it due to the government, and how it was received",

On Friday night 6/6/08 about 12:30 to 1:00am I noticed what appeared to be balloons flying in the air as if they had broken free from say a car dealer lot. This was a huge string of balloons; however as I watched I noticed it had the ability to fly in formation, so I thought maybe it was a flock of birds, but then I realized that it was to late and no birds fly this late. I started watching more closely trying to figure out what I thought I was seeing. Whatever this was it had the ability to fade in and out of sight meaning one second I could see pieces and the next second it was as if it had totally disappeared and then the next second it was visible again. It started off as a straight line then as it moved east to west it changed to a semicircle with the open end facing east. It disappeared the reappeared in a v shape I noticed it was banking to the south. Thats when I could see what looked like a dome shape within the v shape I could only see part of it. The other strange part we live close to an air force base, so I am familiar with different types of aircraft as well as the landing patterns whatever this was it was actually flying lower than the standard helicopter pattern also no engine noise. I have no idea what this actually was, but I can tell you that it was not technology that we are aware of. In truth I have no clue as to what this was in the end I got scared and went inside my home. I checked the wind direction for that night it was out of the wsw 5 to 8 knts.",

After 40 years of watching airplaines, you can easily tell the difference between an A-7 and an A-10 and a 747.

It first appeared as though an aircraft was approaching the house although there was no green light or strobe. It appeared stationary. A fourth red light appeared to the left of the craft, equi-distant from the others. As this light appeared, the light on the far right disappeared. This process repeated itself three times. All the lights then blinked out at the same time. Weather conditions were clear with high scattered clouds. The moon was full two nights ago but had not risen yet.

      "story": "Bright triangle shaped lights over Tucson skies At 4:50 in the morning on November 8th, my boyfriend - age 20 and myself - age 18 were outside on his back patio while he smoked a cigarette. His house is located on the far north east side of Tucson, off of Catalina highway and it is surrounded by moutains. It was over these moutains that I saw an extremely bright light off in the distance that appeared to be rising at an angle in the sky. At first, I assumed it was a police helicopter shining its spot light in our direction but it was moving at an abnormally fast pace and the light never seemed to shine in any other direction. Planes, as well as helicopters, fly over my boyfriend's house quite frequently and they both have a very distinct sound. The object I witnessed made no noise what so ever. At this point, I called my boyfriend over to look at it and as we both stood watching it, the object appeared to freeze where it was and simply hover in place. The two of us got the feeling that it was watching us and ran inside of the house to wake up my boyfriend's mother. We were inside of the house for twenty seconds at the most before returning outside.  In the short period of time that we were inside of the house, the object had made it's way all of the way over to the other side of the sky and was now gliding slowly towards the city. It was flying incredibly low and from what I could make out, it appeared to be triangle shaped with a bright red light that protruded slightly from the center with three smaller, but incredibly bright white lights at each rounded point. My boyfriend's mother, who was a skeptic, described it as looking like a ferris wheel turned on it's side with the red light representing the axis. The three of us watched it in the distance and as we did, it appeared to go straight up in the air, then down at an angle and hover for a moment, then go straight up again and repeat the zig-zag pattern until we lost sight of it.  Another unusual event had occured a few months prior at the location where I first spotted the object in the sky which I feel is worth mentioning. My boyfriend had been out smoking on the patio around four in the morning in early July when we noticed what appeared to be a vapor trail that was surrounded by different, glowing colors (namely red, purple and green) in the north east area of the sky. It hung in the air for atleast an hour with all other colors but red fading away slowly. The red glow and vapor trail remained until sun rise. Over the following few days after we had witnessed the trail, people were saying that it was a result of missle testing however I have yet to see any images of missle testing that compare to what I saw that night.",

I was just about to put it out and go inside when she yelled to me and pointed to the north eastern part of the sky. To my amazement I saw what first appeared to be a helicopter but in the seconds there after it was undeniable that this was nothing that I had ever seen before. At first it was an incredibly bright light as if pointing in our direction with a hint of red light with it. The thing I noticed right away was that there was no sound what so ever coming from this thing in the sky. As we watched we saw it grow larger as it came closer and more detail into our line of sight. While it was on the horizon approaching us, it appeared to be the classic saucer shaped object. As it got closer, I could see that it was actually in the shape of a triangle(when viewed from underneath) with rounded edges.  When compared with the size of a large, full moon, it would have been slightly smaller in the sky about 95% of the time we viewed it, except the short time it went almost directly over top of where we were.  It didn't go directly over top of us, however it was very close and as it went over top of us I could see that there was something protruding from the center of the underbelly that had a red light that was in the shape of a sphere. At this point I could tell that it was between eighty five and a hundred and ten feet in the air. The whole time it did not make a sound and the interesting thing that I noticed was that it seemed like every coyotye in ear shot was howling seemingly at whatever we were witnessing. There were other lights around the edges of the craft and they seemed to be a bright white. As we watched it, I saw that it seemed to be going straight up and down five to ten feet in short, quick spurts or jerks similiar to seeing a piece of metal bouncing or being pushed around between two magnets.  After noticing this I was suddenly struck with absolute terror, as it suddenly became clear to me that compared to this, I was nothing more than an ant, to possibly be stepped on at any moment.  At this point my girlfriend and I were so frightened and overwhelmed that we ran into the house and after a few panicky moments decided to wake my mother.  Soon the three of us were outside attempting to find this thing in the sky again, and to my surprise, in that short period of time, the object had suddenly switched to the opposite corner of the sky(southwest) though still very visible.  We watched it float towards the southwest for anothr minute or two until all of a sudden it just disappeared as if someone flipped a light switch.  That was the last we saw of the object.",

I had a towel over my face because I had lost my sunglasses but took it off because my face was getting too hot.   I looked up in the sky because I saw some clouds and I hoped they wouldn\u2019t block the sun while I was tanning. I first thought I was seeing eye fluid bubbles, \u201cI don\u2019t know their correct name\u201d, and so I rubbed my eyes and lay starring up at the clouds again not expecting to see anything. Watching the clouds move, I let my eyes relax in a gaze. What I saw were two very little or just really high in the sky, ball shaped, silver objects moving and stopping in and around the clouds. I watched as they moved and stopped and fallowed each other in the sky. After a while one vanished and the other vanished soon after.  I told my sister when she got home but she just said, \u201cOh\u201d, but that to be expected I guess.

I do live in Tucson by DM Air force Base, and see planes in the sky all the time these were not planes and weather balloons don\u2019t move like that.

      "story": "Sceptic observation of 3 \"fighter jet sized\" oblong, black and silver light flashing crafts. I was sitting in my back yard on the east side of Tucson having a break from yard work and visiting with a friend. We apparently live in a flight path as we often have jets from Davis Monthan AFB flying over and often helicopters at a lower level. As we were talking, I noticed what my mind assumed were jets practicing for an upcoming air show in the sky behind my friend. I had this initial thought because the maneuvers of the 3 \"jets\" seemed very much like what we see when the pilots practice. As I was talking my eyes kept going back until I had to interrupt the conversation. I suddenly realized they were not only very oddly shaped, (oblong and black) but they were very close and there was zero sound. We got up and went to the edge of the yard as they were coming closer. My friend said they look like sky divers as they were apparently connecting then releasing in a triangular and straight pattern. It looked as if 2 would connect and let go then all three would do the same. This went on for a few more minutes and we both commented on things like weather balloons of some sort or perhaps some kind of weather anomaly. We were both trying to figure out the explanation. They began flashing what would be best described as, a silver light. Not in a specific pattern (not that we recognized) but random and they would stay lit when they connected into the straight pattern. It became more and more obvious that we had no idea what we were looking at. When they connected and lit, it seemed as if they \"melted\" into a single craft. Then a jet passed over the area above them. This reinforced the lack of sound as we could hear this jet quite well and it was farther than the unidentified crafts. They then began to rise into the sky as we watched the display of aerodynamics and the light show. My friend called her daughter in-law who was in the neighborhood. She told her to go outside and my friend tried to help her locate them over the phone. I ran in the house and took a 12\" x 12 mirror off the wall. We h! ad alrea dy decided that a photo at this point would be useless. When they were at their closest, we were still trying to rationalize and now they would just be too far away.  I went back out and tried reflecting light towards the ground at first to see if I could get the same reflection off the mirror in proportion to where I was situated on the ground. (They were NNW of my home when we first spotted them) After realizing I could not reflect in this direction I began trying to flash the mirror, in theirs. Perhaps I was looking for some kind of a response. My friend went to meet the daughter in-law as she was terribly excited and wanted my friend to point out what we were seeing. She was not able to find them again to show her daughter in-law, after she left my house. I watched them a total of about 30 to 40min more until they had gone so high, they were just a periodic spec of light, and then they were gone. I am no aviation expert but I have never, ever seen a plane or any other piloted craft go so high up. I keep trying to make sense of what we saw. If I had been alone, I would not have told anyone what I had seen and I would have been sure to stay out of the sun for the remainder of the day. I am considered by others and myself to be a skeptical person, so I welcome any logic that could explain all of this.",

Attends ((deleted)) At 2230 hrs this date, I (deleted))) went to the front of my yard to walk towards a neighbor with the intent of checking on their dog since they were away on vacation.  Our house lies in the Foothills (North Central) area of Tucson adjacent the Catalina Mountains.   I heard one of my dogs bark and I turned to look back at the house. Directly above the house I observed the object.  The object was flying South to North.  I would estimate that it was directly above I-10 (I-10 runs north and south) I-10 is approx. 7 miles due West of my House.  It was approx. 25 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate, and its only an estimate that from light to light would make the object at least one mile long.  My first thought was that the object(s) were in fact 3 objects strung out together and flying in formation. I assumed they were helicopters flying North. There is a Marine aviation base due north of us. Holding my hand at arms length in front of me, I would estimate object would have been (from running light to running light) 4-5 fingers in length.   The object at its southern point had one non-flashing light, in its approx center was another non flashing red light, at its northern point were two lights, one which was white and non blinking and another light very close to the white light and it was red in color and blinking.  My wife exited the front door and I yelled at her to grab the binoculars and run out with them. This she complied with, retireved the binoculars and she and ((name deleted)) came out to join me.  I brought the binoculars into focus and could see the object, which appeared to be moving fairly slow and continuing North. I could also ascertain that there was a darkened area between the 4 lights and that in fact these were not 3 seperate objects. This horizontal area or structure did not appear to be very high but was flattened and \"line\" like.       I handed off the binoculars to both ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)).   We continued to watch the object as it continued North.   Approx 3 minutes into the observation the object appeared to make a flight adjustment and it began turning into a North-West flight angle.  At this point and through the Binoculars I could now see the rear end of the object. You could now see that it possessed 2 white lights in the rear of the structure.  It looked as though you were watching the rear end of a car that had two white running lights.  The distance between the two rear light would be approx 1 finger held up at arms length.  The 3 other lights (red in the center, white and blinking red up from) were also still visible but at more of an angle.  The front flashing red light was still visible.  At all times the lights remained at a fixed distance from each other, the distance never varied as it would if you were watching a string of conventional aircraft stuggling to maintain position relative to each other.   I was able to observe the object from its new flight path for approx another minute to two minutes until it was lost over the horizon.  The object appears to have corrected its flight path from when first viewed to the point that it turned NorthWest as I believe I-10 makes the same course adjustments.  I believe the object was certainly following and flying directly above I-10, turning as I-10 turned, but Im not completely sure of this.   I could not estimate its speed, but it was not flying very quickly, but I would guess that if these were in fact helicopters, it would appear to be about the same speed as a helicopter at that distance.  There was no sound.  We contacted a nearby neighbor (too late for him to see it), but as we talked in the driveway he related to me that during a ball game this evening, the crowds were witnessing many strange lights in the night skies.......he didnt elaborate.  I have made a rough sketch of the object, will enhance the sketch and send it off to you in the morning. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Sketch of the object received.  PD))",

      "story": "Bright glowing lights flying in the clouds in Tucson I saw two large bright glowing lights flying either in the clouds or just above the clouds.  Kind of off white color, maybe slightly yellowish.  Shape of both lights was mostly circular, but slightly oval.  They flew in an absolutely straight line, very fast for their size, no sound, and maintained an exact distance from each other.  I couldn't tell if it was two aircraft or one aircraft with two lights, but in either case, it had to be absolutely HUGE.  Each light was about the size of a dime if I put my arm out straight and held a dime in my fingers.  They came from the south and were heading in a north or slightly northwest direction.  Took less than 10 seconds for them to streak across the sky and out of sight. The date is approximate but definitely during the week of November 6.  I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start.  I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn't there that early.  When I saw the lights go by, I froze, didn't want to blink or even breath.  The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw anything like this.  After the lights went by, I looked around the parking lot to see if anyone else saw it, but no one was around.  That in itself was odd.  There should have been several people in the parking lot by that time. When lunchtime came, I went back to my unit to report it to the SOC desk.  I asked them to call the tower or base ops to see if they saw it or got any similar reports.  The guy at the SOC desk just laughed and made a joke of it, like \"ha ha, Sgt E saw a UFO, what were you drinking, what were you smoking, can I have some of that too?\"  I kind of expected that since he was an assclown so I let him joke around for a minute and then I asked him, ok can we get serious now?  Just call the tower and ask them if they saw it.  Next he just ignored me so I pressed him a little harder.  Then one of the ADOs came out of his office and told me to just drop it, asked me if I have somewhere I need to be and told me to get going. I've never seen anything like it since but if I ever do, I'll certainly never report it through Air Force channels since no one wants to hear about it anyway.  There's simply no one who takes such reports.  Report it through your chain of command and they won't give a crap.  Report it to any other Air Force agency and it will never make it past the nearest shredder or trash can.  The \"that's not my job\" philosophy definitely applies here. Since I just found this site and a couple others like it, I figured I'd check to see if anyone else ever saw what I saw, but I don't see any that match this particular sighting.  So for what it's worth, here's my one and only sighting.  If I see any more, I'll let you know.",

I remember the time exactly because I was sitting in my car drinking coffee, parked just outside the flightline at Davis-Monthan AFB waiting for my shift to start. I was participating in an exercise and normally wasn't there that early. It was still fairly dark outside but daylight was just starting to break.  As I was looking forward through the windshield, I first saw the lights out of the corner of my eye out the driver side window.  Even before I turned to look at them, I could instantly tell these were odd lights in the sky.  As I watched the lights go by, I froze, didn't want to blink or even breath, and I had this real ominous feeling like I was in the presence of something otherworldly. The lights flew either right above the runway or were slightly outside the perimeter of the base, but they were going in the same direction as the runway. These lights were so bright, they lit up the clouds.  I had been in the Air Force for over 11 years at that point, worked the flightline day and night, seen all kinds of aircraft come and go and I NEVER saw lights on a conventional aircraft that were big enough or bright enough to do this, especially since the lights were just as bright coming from the south as they were when they flew out of range to the northwest.  It really frustrated me that there was a straight narrow path of clouds going from the south to the northwest while most of the rest of the sky was clear.  These clouds were slightly puffy and relatively low in the sky.  I would best describe them as stratocumulus, and guess their altitude between 6,000 to 10,000 feet.  I was hoping the lights would make a turn so I could get a better look at them but they stayed behind this narrow path of clouds the entire way and I was never able to see an object.  Also, I should mention that as bright and fast as these lights were, surprisingly I saw no contrails at all.

I am near the base of the south-westerly end of the Santa Catalina Mountains.  My ZIP is 85704, and my altitude is 2500 feet above sea level. This (Monday) evening I was sitting on my second-floor balcony enjoying the evening air and observing the night sky to my north-east.  I was not using binoculars or a telescope.  The sky in my view was cloudless and I could clearly observe Capella rising in my direct field of view.  I was wearing my distance nighttime-diving glasses to aid my view of the night sky; however, my un-aided distance vision is excellent. At 1910 hours I observed a dark object transit my field of view, traveling generally from a north-northwesterly direction to a south-southeasterly direction at a steady speed and course.  The angle above the horizon was about 35 degrees and the object passed well above Capella.  At first I thought it was a flight of geese in a tight \u2018V\u2019 formation of symmetrical shape.  However, the shape simply was too uniform and steady to be a flight of birds; unlike the shape of a flight of geese which changes in shape over even a short period of time.  I thought that I could see individual dark objects, perhaps 9 or 10 of them, forming the \u2018V\u2019 (a \u2018V\u2019 similar to boomerang-shape but broader at the center than the traditional boomerang shape). I observed this object for approximately 40 seconds - I have an additional view to the east and south-east which I can observe through a separate opening in my balcony.  So, I was able to observe the object as it passed through an arc of about 90-100 degrees. There was no sound and no light from the object.  I have no clue as to the object\u2019s altitude.  However, my guess is that if the object was flying at 1,000 feet above the ground, its speed was about 120 miles per hour; perhaps a bit more. I\u2019m submitting this report simply to confirm and reinforce any other reports you may have received concerning this object.",

At first I thought it was a star, but then I noticed a red dot next to it. There were no clouds in the sky. It was floating next to a group of small mountains. Both dots were about the size of pinheads. The red dot was \u201corbiting\u201d the white dot, moving from its left to right side, around it. The white dot moved slowly down and towards the mountains (my left), then up and continuing left. It appeared to be moving farther away, since the red dot was beginning to be harder to see, but I could still make out when it crossed in front of the white dot. This was about 15 minutes in. The white dot then started to make small counter-clockwise circles, stop, then make small clockwise circles. It repeated this about 3 or 4 times. It was very tiny at this point. Every time I looked away to try and make a phone call, it was hard to locate again. The white dot started to move towards the mountains again (my right), so I ran into the house to look for a better camera than the one on my phone, because it was too small to make out. I was in there for about 5 minutes, and when I came back outside it was gone.",

We seen 4 lights that where bright red and orange toward the south west part of Tucson. They disappeared right in front of us, and then 2 further west appeared. I ran inside to get the camera. When I came back out 20 seconds later they where gone. We both where like what the heck was that. After a few minutes 3 more appeared then another one, then another one. I took there pictures. And as fast as they appeared they then disappeared in a different order of how they appeared. One minute later 3 more popped up. I took there pictures. And once again as fast as they appeared they disappeared. This went on for a good 15 minutes off and on again. They where big red and orange lights.  I could not see any big body attached to the lights. But when the lights went out I could see an object behind it, but I could not make it out. It was getting dark outside. Two of them split from the pack and headed more west at the same time of 4 more coming back into view. But I did get pictures and I will take in the camera and get them developed tomorrow. 25 minutes from seeing the first one the Air Force had 3 planes circling the area we seen all the UFO\u2019s. They where not any air craft that I see every day, and that light that is was putting out was high in the sky. It was not any flares, and it was not coming from any type of air craft we have. I have lived by the Air Force base for a total of 10 years. And right by the Air Port for as many years. I have lived in Tucson for 28 years and have lived by and seen every type of plane we have and every light they put out. These where nothing we have. Thank You,",

These lights were not stationary at any point nor were they ever pretending to be stars. They flew PAST us. They made no noise. They came from seemingly nowhere both times, one light at a time. Perhaps the same light visited us both times. On this night we were at some weird place we came across called X-9 Ranch... it's privately owned land within the Saguaro National Park right by the Rincon Mountains. That night we had two very-low flying bright lights visit us -once to say hello and once as we were leaving.  The light was completely silent, the object itself was indistinguishable but I believe it was just pure light. One solid bright light like a candle, with smaller flashing colors in or around it. It flew a bit quirky and nervously, as though it was drawn to us against its will. I think the attention we were giving it made it feel uncomfortable. The first light came from the south in the direction of the city. Though we were both looking in that direction when it appeared, neither of us saw where the light originated from nor did we see it approaching from a very far distance - it just became \"there\". When this first light came I flashed a high-beam flashlight into the sky (the type that beams through the air and can be seen for miles) at it which caused it to start fly/floating a bit drunkardly. It tried to veer itself away from the B-line on which it was coming towards us. Then it just tried to act cool and fly smoothly, attempting to maintain a more android flashing sequence, floating away like it had not notice us.... but in a \"looking out of the corner of it's eyes\" at us sort of way. But it was too late for his ruse! He/it had already been busted out and discovered as some sort of an intelligent life form as it responded to our stimuli (both physical, i.e. flashlight; and mental/verbal, i.e. thought and ver! bal command/request). The second light appeared later coming from the north. My friend and I had both agreed it was time to get going. I turned around from my view of the city to look back at the mountain right behind us and coming up from behind the mountain  over the top came an identical light to the one from earlier. I said \"Look, they came to say goodbye!\" My friend turned around and said \"Whoa, where the hell did that come from?\" I was pleased and we both watched it as it floated/flew awkwardly towards us and jumped a bit in its flight path with the small quickness of a firefly. It was an entity. Oct 20 12:00 am - 6:00 am Oct 21/2009  They perch over the mountains and I drive up to them. Get close to the basin of the mountain and they'll give you a private show. The night before the previous incident the same friend and I were again late-night hiking, this time around the Catalina mountain area. It was a man-made hiking trail and an easy one at that, however it surrounds it's hikers on either side with fencing lined with dense bushes on the left to separate the businesses/housing area and on the right... nothing but desert and barbed-wire fencing beginning where the width of the hiking trail ends and no-mans-land begins. This desert shrubbery was particularly unnerving in an exciting sort of way because there are very dense desert trees, bushes, shrubs and so forth mixed with cacti and all sorts of hiding spots that some sort of stalking predatory animal could come out of.... You could just feel it... I sensed we were in \"Cat Country\". I told my friend the vibe I was getting and he agreed it could very well be. Never the less we journeyed on. We found a little hidden rock area to chill and watch the stars. I had noticed while we were on the trail two aliens positioned over the mountain. (I just call them aliens, a.k.a UFOs). I had my eye on them and went back to the trail to go see them while my friend stayed on the rocks. I watched them and they were the typical \"posers\" in the sky; trying to look like stars but completely having trouble staying still and they were VERY responsive to thought. I confirmed that those were my aliens for the night and went back to chill with my friend on the rocks. Before long we heard the screams of some sort of animal - probably a bob cat or a mountain kitty - and we reckoned it was time to go. Before we left I stopped my friend on the trail and said \"Look. See those two aliens?\" pointing towards them right above the mountain's top horizon. He said \"Yeah I do...\" I said \"Watch, does it look like they are moving?\" The aliens began to wiggle out of their stationary positions in the sky. I moved my arms, like a conductor of an orchestra, and directed them which way to go in the sky. I would lift up my arm and motion to the right, they would fly that way in the sky in tandem. To the left, and the same. Figure 8 too. I said \"Are you seeing this?\".  He said he did. He was astonished and quiet and humble. He took on the same calm awe that I had seen in my other friend who experienced the same phenomenon with me the first time over the same mountains about a month earlier. They just watched in quiet and seemed accepting of it and me, the crazy girl who thinks she is an alien who brings them to the mountains to play with UFOs. I have great friends. lol.",

      "story": "Saw what appeared to be stars shooting \"laser\" lights down, also an object emitting other objects in to another I have seen the same things in the sky for over a year.  One night my dog  was extremely anxious and began to bark angrily and excessively at the back door. I was reluctant to get up and let her out as she had just been out. I had gotten off work late and was eating dinner at the table, my dog was going crazy (like when someone knocks on the door) I finally got up and took her out, she ran out with the hair on her back standing up. When I got outside to take a look around I looked and saw what I thought was the police chopper, It was a large light hovering pretty low. I went back inside to finish my dinner, however my dog continued to be very upset, so I went back outside to physically carry her back inside. When I went outside I stopped and watched what I originally thought was a police chopper, and as I watched I realized it was something else. The light seemed to grow in size and it shot a smaller \"star\" out and that star shot out and we watched it glide across the sky, ! it shot north and we watched it until we could no longer see it. It also appeared to have what looked like a streak of grey afterburner smoke under it. Naturally I called everyone I knew to tell them about what I had seen, my brother suggested that I keep my cell phone on me and try to get a picture of it, if it happened again. I decided that was a good idea. I never thought I would see anything like that again, however the next day I had my phone in my pocket, and my dog began to bark excitedly again. I ran outside and looked up and around for a while, then right above me  I spotted a red laser looking thing shooting out of what I thought was a star. At first I thought it was my imagination, but I put my cell phone on video and held my arm up for about half an hour and suddenly I actually saw it again and got it video taped on my cell phone. After that point in the days to come my dog continued to bark excitedly and sure enough when I go outside if I look up in the general direction where she is barking, I almost always get a shot of a \"star\" shooting a laser usually white sometimes blue and red only twice.  It  has been a! year and I probably have around 60 videos of these things. I can only surmise that they make a sound that we cannot hear but that my dog can hear. Aside from the \"stars that  shoot lasers, we also have videos of what looks like 5-6 \"stars\" and suddenly one \"star\" like light comes out of the bottom of one \"star\" and slowly goes up in to another. I keep referring to  the word \"star\" because if you do not know what you are looking for they just look like stars. It's my dog that hears or senses something that alerts me to something strange up there. Often times there are three \"stars\" in the shape of a triangle out there and the two bottom stars of the triangle shoot lasers. I  have been hesitant to report anything because I don't want to be classified as a crazy person, however I need to report to someone, I know what I have seen and what I have on video. I live in a town where there is a military base, and I sometimes wonder if they are experimenting with something, but I am tired of seeing things, I am tired of my dog getting so upset and I just want to know what these things are. Can you help?",

      "story": "I am apparently being watched, because my family is from Roswell NM. I never knew anybody was taking official reports.  Sorry for the delay, I heard about you last week.  I've been telling this story to anybody with an interest.  There's more than one encounter, I'll start with the first one and keep adding.  I'm 62, this happened when I was 40, and it continued to happen.  My last encounter was 1991 and I sort of avoid being caught in this again. My family is from Roswell NM.  My grandfather's sister ((name deleted)) and her husband had a ranch there in the early 1900s.  My dad's family lived in Las Vegas NM.   My grandfather worked on the railroad there.  He died in an accident, and my father was 12, he went to live with his Aunt in Roswell.  He knew all the native American teenagers.  They all grew up together.  They took the horses to the mesas and camped out a lot. My dad used to visit every summer, he loved the desert, only he wouldn't drive at night.  The night desert spooked him.  My dad couldn't wear a watch, the hands would spin.  We sort of accepted that as a crazy thing, never paid much attention to it. While we were crossing the desert with my dad in 1954, I had an incident.  I was about 10.  We got to Gallup NM, and I bolted from the car and ran - My dad couldn't figure out what was wrong.  I was hysterical.  I remember it to this day.  There was a time gap, something like that - I couldn't account for missing time.  After my dad calmed me down, we got a hotel and stayed the night.  I'm telling you this, because in 1991, the exact same thing happened when I got near Gallup NM.  Only that time, my son was with me - and he remembers it. We got picked up in 1991 - we drove up a ramp or something, or thru a vortex, that looked exactly like Gallup NM - only the people weren't acting right.  They were acting - my son remembers passing the same landmark twice - and now he's 26, and he still remembers it.  We never talk about it, its pretty upsetting. The 1991 incident was like the final time - I kept getting picked - they were following me around - I was so used to it, I would just play dumb and hope that the time frame would move along - they're still watching me, but I have asked them please do not interfere with me or my family - I'm getting a little too old for this- we need to be as normal as possible. Back to 1987 - We were living in Los Angeles in 1984.  I had a strange feeling, like I was supposed to move to Tucson.  My cousin lived there, so we went to visit.  After we got home, I sold everything and we moved to Tucson.  Just pulled up and moved.  I got a job at the University of ARizona assisting the Dean.  I have a BA in Fine Arts, and I was a legal secretary for 20 years.  I'm also a music teacher. I understand mathematical principles and science, and was majoring in math, but I got bad headaches.  The math calculations would spin so fast, it gave me a headache.  So I switched to music.  I can hear music in my head - which really helps if you compose.  It's a fairly common skill among musicians. But somehow, this ability to hear and pick up sound, was meant for more than music.  I started picking up sound when I got to Tucson.  I could hear things and I would ask people, do you hear that?  They couldn't hear anything.  I heard a high pitched signal, like a transmitter.  My son can hear these high pitched signals too.  In fact, he used to hold his ears shut with his hands and refuse to go into places he could hear it. Either it was subliminal broadcasting, or I was listening to something else.  Tucson is a pretty strange place you understand, pretty close to the largest copper deposit in America - copper will pick signals up, I think. I was at the University for about 2 years, on and off, and I had a job working for an attorney.  In July 1987, I started picking up stronger signals at the university.  Like something was under the university property.  I worked in a basement laboratory for a professor.  I finally had to quit, I got dizzy and I couldn't concentrate. As soon as I quit, I started hearing the same signals in my apartment - and it got really strong.  I started freaking out - I lost my cool - and since my family has always been a little strange in the first place - I decided to would have a chat with whoever was signaling. I said, out loud \"Look, whoever you are, I'm a rational person, I don't talk to people who aren't there, who I can't see, so if you need to talk to me, you need to be really really clear, and it has to be something I can't miss.\"  So I tossed it out there - and apparently they heard me.  Because a few days later, I was losing sleep and becoming increasingly disoriented.   I fell asleep in the afternoon with the window open - and the next thing I know - a massive gust of wind came thru the window and slammed all the doors - and I could not open my eyes.  I could see without my eyes being open. I was on some planet and the temperature was below zero - everything was frozen solid - I could hear the sound of breaking glass, or high pitched bells, people talking - and I was unable to move.  I am highly analytical and I started making mental notes - trying to see on the sides -  And just like that, I was out of it.  I literally packed up my kids and told them to get in the car - and I started driving south on Interstate 19 south of Tucson.  I was shaking really bad.  All I knew is I wanted to get out of the apartment - I couldn't breathe and I was shaking really bad  A storm started rising up from the South, and started moving in - I got off the highway at Valencia - and turned left.  I was shaking so bad, I had to stop the car.  I told the kids to get out, while I calmed down. Somebody was standing right behind me - that I couldn't see, blowing on my neck.  I had the kids with me, and I was terrified.  We started walking, and we went a few blocks, and ended up in front of a bank.  It started raining, the kids were wondering what was going on.  I told them, go in the bank and sit down, I'll stay out here for a couple of seconds. As soon as the kids went in the bank, and I was standing there - the bank saw we were in distress and called the police.  The police came, talked to me, and I had to make something up - like I was tired -  Right about then, I looked like a lunatic.  My kids were really upset.  They called my husband at work - he works as a mathematician and engineer. While the police were standing there, the storm rolled in, two of the policemen touched me, and man, a huge bolt of lightening smacked me - and I saw the sun explode - and I thought - well, I must be dead..... The police looked at me, grabbed me again, and somebody took over my body and literally threw the police on the ground.  I guess touching is a no-no.  Then this voice goes \"do exactly as I tell you, we need to get you out of here\". I guess I was on the \"wrong side\"  The police started acting really stangely.  A woman came out of the bank, and she stared at the police and said \"she's fine you need to go now\" - and they got in the car and left.  When did you ever see that happen.  Then she said \"come inside, do you need a glass of water?\"  All of a sudden, it all turned, now everybody wanted to get me a glass of water.  My husband showed up, he stared at me and the kids - and he tried to escort us home.  It just got crazier and crazier after that. Somebody started driving the car, and the kids and I had to go for a ride.  I wasn't \"me\" anymore - I was somebody else.  Whoever it was, beamed down here. After about a day of driving around, and running out of gas in the desert, the police found us again - and man I had some explaining to do after that.  My husband was furious.  I had to sit there and take it - and pretend I was nuts - I wasn't nuts.   I was trying to observe.  He was trying to show me something.  He explained things. When I said, \"well why are you telling me all this stuff, I'm nobody.\"  the answer was pretty much I had to wait about 25 years, and then there was a pretty good possibility that the information would end with me unless people were willing to listen.  Other than look like a nut, that's how it all started. The police transported me to a mental facility - and I had to sit there for 4 weeks looking like a nut case.  I went along with the whole thing.  While I was there, I had a little radio with a headset.  When I changed the batteries, the batteries drained in my hand.  That hasn't happened again. After 1987, nothing happened again until 1991 - I was driving across I-40, approaching Gallup NM, and the road just ended, there was another flash, and the road was back - only I was not in Gallup NM. I stop there all the time, whenever I drive to NM.  Chief Yellowhorse sits on the property - it's a sacred site.  I usually stop and go in, maybe get a drink and buy some jewelry - but most things are unspoken -  The university offered me an office position with the Mars project - but I turned it down and went back to Los Angeles.  If I knew what was going on, I could be much more straightforward. While I was in Los Angeles, I saw the black triangle craft with the red lights, just once.  It hovered over the San Fernando Valley - I think long enough for me to see it - then it left. The only other thing that was pretty spectacular, was a light show over Mesa Arizona around 1991 - it was a series of dots and dashes in blasts of color, that streamed across the sky and went directly over our apartment.  I got my husband and the neighbors, and we all stood there and watched.  It came from the direction of the airport, and the next day, the paper ran a story that somebody was fooling around with lights - and not to pay any attention to them. I have a lot to say, there's more, but that gives you a general idea of what happened.  I had problems going to Santa Fe NM a couple of years ago.  I told them, again,  \"I am not going to tolerate a repeat performance, so if you don't mind, I need you to back off!\"  And they respect my wishes, if you can believe that. We sort of have an understanding.  They're here if I need them to be here for any reason, which is sort of comforting, but I really don't want to go thru anything like that ever again unless it's part of scientific research and there's plenty of documentation and researchers on board.  I'm more than happy to walk any research team thru this, I'm just not going to chase them down.  They need to ask me and respect the territory.  I refuse to be treated like a nut job -  I just saw your Characteristics secion.  Yes, my car engine stopped and forced me to walk for miles in the desert.  Also, in 1987, on that date, (I am positive of the date)  tucson lost all electricity at the date and hour - all the electricity went out for about 15 minutes in an electrical storm - you would have to check the newspapers - but I'm sure that was the day -  The voice kept saying \"I'm turning off the power\" - apparently they can't get in unless the power is out -  There was also a lot of extremely loud \"car\" type horns - deep ones - blasting signals - it all happened so fast - and then the voice goes \"how's this?\"  He's a real sarcastic alien with a really great sense of humor - it's like \"jokes on me\" - It's like, human beings think they are so smart, and that just isn't the case.  We are really really stupid.  I came to terms with my stupidity years ago, and I guess that's appealing. I'm positive they were watching my dad and then me - this is a family thing - I am not even sure if we're from this planet - I'm starting to have my doubts seriously - this family is very very strange -  You won't be able to meet my oldest brother - but he looked exactly like an alien drawing - he was super tall and very thin and bony - he even scared me a little - He passed away a few years ago.  I guess our family was out in Roswell when that craft went down in 1947 - I was born in 1946 in California - at least that's what they tell me.  My birth certificate is from a hospital that doesn't exist anymore - and there are no photos of my mom being pregnant - she and I never got along much - it was mostly dad and myself. Well, if that isn't the strangest story you got in a long time, at least you were entertained.  I also see that you want to know if I agree to talk to an investigator.  Yes, you can do that, but don't do it over a phone. Email is better.  I can't talk by phone to anybody and depend on the conversation being confidential.  My ex husband works at the National Security Agency in Washington.  He monitors my phone calls - he hates me because I threw him out 30 years ago.  That's a whole other story.   I wish aliens would pick him up and keep him.  Much love.  ((name deleted))",

The object had disappeared.  This sighting was approximately 2 to 3 seconds. It was very fast, but long enough to see what I saw. Approx. 10 minutes later, myself, husband, and daughter observed 2 very large Military helicopters flying in from the Northwest, flying Southeast. Since there are numerous bases in the area, including Davis Monthan to our South, the sightings of helicopters isn\u2019t unusual. The helos were flying slow and very, very low, in fact I don\u2019t recall ever seeing helicopters this low before and neither has my husband. Also, the flight corridor that they were utilizing is one I have never seen them use before. They flew directly over the area that I observed the object in, which was approx. 200 feet west of my back fence. May have been a coincidence, but then again it may not have.",

It was around 10:15 pm. I look in the sky all the time. One of my friends that was with us is an engineer and gets into the paranormal and UFO\u2019s. We talk about it a lot. This was very crazy and much unexpected. Over the Tucson Mountains to our west, we noticed 3 Hugh orange lights and changing colors to red and white. At the same time we noticed 2 more strange white smaller lights over head a lot closer to us. They made no noise what so ever, and there was no running lights or any blinking lights on it.  Looking back over at the 3 lights over the Tucson Mountains as they changed color and where pulsating. Just like the Phoenix UFO on the news some years ago. They went out one by one and out of order. Then with in a couple of short minutes later they showed up over the Silverbell mountains and did the exact same thing then disappeared. My friends where looking at the 2 over our head and did not see the lights over the Silverbell mountains. When I told them too look they disappeared that fast. I looked back at the smaller lights over our heads as they where coming closer too us. These lights where white, and pulsating and moving more up then down. No other lights on the craft. One was just hovering. The second one was moving away to the west of our position. Then it disappeared. Boom! Just gone!  I know none of the objects we had been looking at where any type of plane. Or helicopter. I live right by the Air force base and the Tucson Air Port and see and hear planes every day. The last one that was hovering stayed there for a few minutes, and then it made a very wide circle and went back to where it was hovering. Then did the same thing as the other one did. Slowly moved to the west and in front of all our eyes it pulsated then disappeared. Two days later on 2-23-09 I was standing outside my home looking up into the sky at all the stars and planes still thinking about the other night. When a white light with no running lights or any other blinking lights on it came from the east, very slow. As it came closer I noticed it was not making any sound what so ever. It then got Hugh so bright that it hurt my eyes. It then stopped due south of my home just with in a mile of me. I noticed 3 Air force jets circling it. The light then went down in intensity. Then flu away to the west and then it was gone in a second. The Air Force jets seam to be following it away. After it disappeared the Air Force jets just went back to the base after 5 minutes or so. All I could say is I have been around for 48 years and have been a sky watcher all my life. This was a special few days.",

For the last three nights it has been observed at a 15 minute earlier time in the evening.  The light flashes with a period of 60 seconds and only lasts for 10-15 minutes. It is possibly a satellite but is unusual in that it has very little motion across the sky and is at a very high azimuth from the horizon (approx 80 degrees), I would expect to see geosynchronous satellites at about 30 degrees azimuth from the horizon at this latitude.  I will try observing again tonight but it will probably be too light out at 7:15-7:30 local if the pattern continues of earlier nightly observations.",

The light was relatively stationary over the West part of the city (about 20 miles away from me) at about 3,000 ft in the air. And so I assumed that it was an airliner on it's landing approach to Tucson International. A few things about the light, however, caught my interest. It appeared to be too orange to be an aircraft landing light and it seemed to be positioned too far to the North of TIA's runways 11L/11R to be on the final approach leg to one of those runways (the lines of descending lights on Tucson's Western horizon at night are airliners landing on these runways). After about 2 minutes a smaller orange light broke away from the original light and after a few seconds the two lights casually faded out . The manner in which this happened made me think of a small plane on fire and a part breaking away from it before falling out of the sky, yet I heard no explosions or saw no burning embers fall to earth. Still, the novelty of this event inspired me to wait around a while to see if I could hear any police sirens or breaking news reports about a small plane crash over Tucson. As I was doing this I kept my eyes on the Western sky to see if anything else appeared. After about 15-20 minutes I became bored and went into the house to get something. About 5 minutes later I returned to the porch and resumed my scanning of the Western sky. The sky was now a bluish-green horizon turning to the blackness of night as I spied another similar orange light to the South of the original one, this one farther away and appearing to be at a much higher altitude . This light only appeared for half a second before falling fast like a tear drop and disappearing. I stayed outside for about 30 minutes after that and did not see any other similar events. When I finally went inside, it was night. I wonder if anyone else in the city saw this?  A few things to think about: Davis-Monthan Air Force Base is situated in between my house and the airport. I am a former pilot and have never seen this type of thing before. It could have been a flare drop at the Barry-Goldwater range in the desert to the West of the city, yet it seemed too close for this; it appeared to be in front of the Tucson mountains from my frame of reference. It could have been space phenomena, i.e. meteorite activity, yet all of the meteroite entries into the atmosphere I have seen have been very fast an angular.",

UFO Sighting in Tucson, AZ:  I was standing in front of my apartment, watering my plants, when I saw a strange shape appear out in the sky.  At first I thought it was a balloon or large piece of paper blown by the wind, but then I realized it was too big to be that.  It was about 2 to 3 miles away, and it was floating 300-400 feet off the ground.  It was flashing, and seemed to be spinning as well. The sun was at an angle that I couldn\u2019t see it too well.  It rose at a speed that was far faster than the wind could carry it. I was contemplating calling my mom, when another one appeared coming from below and to the right. It went up and joined the other one, it followed it for a few seconds and then went off on it\u2019s own.  I don\u2019t recall what exactly they did in terms of formation. I called my mom over and showed them to her.  She saw them better because she had sunglasses on.  Another one appeared several seconds later. They were flying around erratically, constantly changing altitudes. The highest I saw them get was 4000-5000 feet.  By the time they left there were 4-5 of them and we were sure these were UFO\u2019s. They left going north. I can\u2019t really say how big they were, but they were big enough to be seen without assistance from very far.  I think they were probes or scouts of some sort, but I\u2019m not sure.

UFO Sighting in Tucson, AZ #2:  I was standing in my backyard with my mother, watering the plants like the case in my last report, when we saw a strange balloon-like object flying 5-6 miles away. It was large, and colorful, and seemed normal, except that it was in the area where airplanes fly. There was a helicopter that was moving in its general direction, and the balloon began to change altitude, moving lower towards the Foothills. I decided it was simply a normal set of stray balloons, but my mother was a little more suspicious, and decided to keep monitoring it. I went to keep watering the plants, when I returned my mother said that the balloon type thing had disappeared into thin air. I found this very strange and failed to locate it myself. 3-4 minutes later, I spotted similar, if not the same, craft(s) as the day before. They were 30-40 miles away above the Catalina Mountains. They had a blinking that was visible even from that height. They stayed fairly immobile compared to the day before. There were more than last time, and they actually made several shapes. Several times, they formed a rhombus, an arrow pointing right, and various other formations that I could not understand. They seemed to be at a very high altitude, being at maybe 10,000-20,000 feet. After 4-5 minutes, 2 or 3 of the crafts descended and were maybe 4000-5000 feet directly above my area. They moved at a speed that was beyond anything I\u2019ve ever seen before. I have seen similar UFO\u2019s two days in a row. I believe this is not a coincidence. They might be monitoring humans, or giving a personal message, or they could be military devices that haven\u2019t been exposed to the public.

We laid down to enjoy the day and we both spotted plane flying over head.  It was a normal passenger plane.  We are near an Air Force base and an International airport.   My wife and I are under a pine tree.  The plane disappears into the braches, and then we spot a very small yet super shinny object up In the sky.  It seemed to be higher than the plane and further away.  The plane crossed between us and the object in our field of view. The object was stationary.  I thought it was an astronomical event, maybe Venus shining very brightly for some odd reason.  So we did not try and find the plane after it flew over the tree we were under.  But neither of us ever saw it again. The UFO stayed in its position for approximately 15 minutes.  After a while we both had taken our eyes off of it, only too look back to its location and not see it there. Instead it was heading northeast at a decent pace, blinking like a light.  Its speed was maybe a little faster than a cruising passenger plane.  However we could not judge its altitude well.  It flew too far away and out of sight for us.  We did not have a video or picture abilities with us.  My wife and I were surprised and proceeded to try and interpret what we had saw. Then after we were digesting what we had saw, we looked back up and she spotted two more objects that were the exact same luminosity and size.  They were floating very slowly in the same direction as the previous one.  They floated away over a period of ten minutes and out of view, however they never blinked or sped up.

On the evening of August 5th at approximately 19:30 a friend and I were videotaping an approaching storm the lightning was really going off. I often film these storms and go back through my footage to find cool still images of lightning. Today was just another day just another storm...so I thought. Later that evening I uploaded my video and started going through it for my shots. As I Scanned through the video something caught my eye flying across the top right corner of my screen. I watched this thing go by over and over and determined it moved to fast to be a bird or a plane, then I discovered that prior to seeing this object, something appears from a cloud in the middle of the screen and zig zags what appears to be into the distance then it shoots off with incredible speed and you here this sound like a ricochet. I decided I needed to go through this footage and see if I had captured any other activity. First I wanted to see what the thing was that was flying across the screen. I zoomed up on the image and it appears to be several (3-4) oval disc shaped objects flying together. I captured the still images for the evidence file. I started back at the begging of my footage to see if any other activity was present. Almost right away just after my camera was placed I discover 2 more UFOs. Both appeared in different locations on the screen at almost the same time. The first appeared about 100 yards away very quickly flies up from behind a large pine tree across the street and flips then descends and appears to go directly behind my buddies truck which we are positioned in front of. The other UFO appears way up in the clouds and is moving very fast through the clouds. As I scanned my footage further I discover another object moving very fast along the horizon real low. It enters from the right as it reaches the left side of the screen in moves in a very fast circular pattern upwards the disappears into the clouds. Further along in the footage an object is seen on the right side of the screen. It appears to be moving towards us the changes direction sharply and zig zags 2 times then flies quickly into the distance. I zoomed up on this to discover it was 3-4 disc shaped objects flying together. After this a few minutes later into the footage we encounter the first UFOs we talked about. One other strange thing appears. A red light appears on the windshield of my buddies truck. It has no reflection in the glass and is only visible for .02 of a second. When I zoom in and slowed the image down it looks very strange and has a pattern of movement. The Duration of the event less than 6 min 22 sec. My buddy and I saw nothing during the time we were videotaping only afterwards was anything discovered. This concludes my report.",

      "story": "typical saucer shaped craft Stationery in the sky appearing to be watching military air show. I can\u2019t give the exact date, but can give you an approximate date because it was during spring training baseball in Tucson.  There also was an airshow going on at nearby  Davis- Monthan Air Force Base.  The year was 2007. My husband, son and I were watching the game, but were distracted by the air show when I noticed idle in the sky between the parks we were at and the airshow was a disk.  I got my son and husband\u2019s attention to see what I was seeing.  Both watched with me for several minutes.  I then turned to a neighbor to the left of me to take a look.  When I turned back to see the UFO it was not visible. I have to go back a second to tell you that I was thinking to myself, \"I see you.\" It was not visible to me the rest of the game and so my attention was drawn back to the game.  A couple of hours later we walked back to our car out in the lot and began our drive back home.   We went on with the rest of our day and there was really no other conversation about what we\u2019d seen. Sometime in the very early hours of the morning, I was awakened by a lime green light in my face.  I was aware that I had been sound asleep and now I was seeing something that made no sense to me.  It had writing along the edge of it.  It seemed to be suspended at head level with me.  I could not make out the symbols.  The light seemed to have formed the size and shape of a VCR.  I sat looked to the right of me where my husband was sleeping soundly to see where I was just to get my bearings.  The clock was where it was supposed to be, and then I looked to the foot of my bed toward the right where the t.v. sat with its light in the lower corner.  Both the clock and t.v. were red yet what I was seeing was lime fluorescent green. I then looked slightly to the left at the foot of my bed and saw that there were 3 small people standing there and one more standing a bit further to the right of the rest.  I have an executive height dresser which sat behind them so I could gauge the height of these little people.  Not one was a full head higher than my dresser. I felt a bit unnerved by this time and turned back toward my husband and wrapped my arms around him and went to sleep.   I didn\u2019t know if they stayed or left and really wanted to feel safe. The next morning very early my son and I went out to the car, the morning dew was still on the window where I saw an unusual hand print of what I only can guess was a thumbprint of some sort and 3 fingers imprinted on the window behind the driver\u2019s seat.  My son and I both looked at it and then looked toward the west where we were met with a very, very bright white light.  So bright it frightened me.  I put my arm around my son and led him back into the house.  He had seen it also. Since that time, we have had occasion to feel some very subtle sensations in our bodies.   I was unaware that my son had a visit from these little people, but he claimed to have had something that woke him too.  I never asked him what all he had experienced that night. Interestingly enough I called my daughter in the bay area to tell her what had happened.  She was in disbelief of course until I told her about the fluorescent green light when she said to me, \u201cmom you aren\u2019t going to believe this, but there was a green light in my room for just a fraction of a second\u201d. I felt that I should say something as time will inevitably fade my memory of events. I suppose it sounds a bit corny to add that I feel we are looked in on from time to time as I believe this area to be somewhat of a hotbed of activity. We were still very new to this area and I always wondered if they were curious or keeping track of the amount of new population growth in this area, but I speculate.  I really have no idea why they were here, but I do know that they were able to keep watch of me at the game, follow me to my car, follow us home and know exactly where I sat in the car and furthermore knew I knew they were aware of me as much as I was aware of them. I don\u2019t have anything else to add, but am unafraid of any repercussions.  I do not drink or take drugs and I\u2019m not crazy.  The story you\u2019ve read is my account of the events that occurred to the best of my recollection.",

I am an attorney, and the very last person that would make up something like this. I was sitting outside this evening with my mother and my sister (Northwest Oro Valley), and we all witnessed what was not a plane, nor helicopter, and the only way I can think to describe it would be to say a UFO. It was hovering above the mountains, not even moving, then it went straight up into the sky (not horizontally as plane would fly, straight up), at a slow hovering pace, we noticed it first as two pulsing lights, it is really hard to explain.  Then it moved over the sky, right above us, and it was DEFINITELY not a plane.  I really do not know how to describe it, I have never seen anything like it.  It was triangular shaped and had a line of lights (I would say about 5), but they were not regular lights.  I really don't know how to describe it. Then it was just gone. Frankly, I am still in a state of shock and awe at this point.  I had my phone with me at the time, and at first we were just so shocked at what we were seeing.  Then I thought of my phone being in my hand, so I turned on the camcorder of my phone, and you can definitely see it.  It is not as clear as what we saw, because it is a video from a phone, but it definitely shows the hovering lights. I don't know why I am even writing this.  I guess because in case other people call in that perhaps report that they saw it, I just wanted to say don't discard them as not being credible. We saw it too.

      "story": "Pure white oval object seen at the Catalina Mountain Range, Tucson, Az. 01/06/12 On the morning of 01/06/12 at 8:30 my friend and I were hiking east of Tucson at the end of Broadway Blvd. in the Saguaro Nat'l Park.  I am 61 and work in retail sales and he is in his 50's and is a professional therapist.  Due north of us is the Catalina Mtn. Range.  I estimated the range to be approx. 5 miles away and upon looking at a map that distance is confirmed. At approx. 9:10 AM I looked to the north towards the Catalinas and saw a pure white object below the skyline thus framed against the mountain itself.  It appeared to be the size of a small plane or good sized helicopter at first notice and was traveling due east skirting the mountain range at a speed that would not be inconsistent with such vehicles.  Since I wasn't paying attention to sound in the environment due to my friend and I having a conversation I then stopped hiking, called the attention of my friend to the object and then listened for engine or rotor sounds. I initially heard motor sounds but we soon both agreed that it was coming from northwest of us and was clearly machinery being used in roadwork or something similar.  I then watched the pure white semi-round object begin to have a ripple effect similar to a bed sheet fluttering in a breeze.  This effect was contained in the confines of the object itself and was not a phenomenon that the object was projecting in any way. It then proceeded to travel on its unwavering horizontal course and became pure white again.  it should be noted that my optometrist told me that with my glasses on (which I was wearing) I have better than 20/20 vision.  My friend told me he has 20/15.  He said he didn't see the initial couple of seconds of the incident due to a cactus being in the way but we both saw the next phase where the object either appeared to be glinting light or creating light.  At this point the object itself could not be seen other than a complete ball of light similar to when a silver plane catches the sunlight and reflects with a strong glow or glare except in this case it was evenly distributed and all encompassing. At this point my friend got a call on his cell phone and he looked down to press the keys to answer the call and that was the end of him seeing the object.  What I saw at that moment was this ball of light that then subsided back into being a pure white object that then made a arced turn towards the north at the same altitude and disappeared heading north and within a second or two was obscured by some mountain peaks. This object was close to being round but seemed more to be slightly elongated from the front to back rather than top to bottom.  There were no noticeable wings or other structures or markings visible on the object and definitely no helicopter propellers.  If I were to guess the size in relation to stars even though it was daytime I would say it was 4 times the size of Venus.  The entire event for me was approx. 10 seconds.  For my friend it was about 5 seconds.  From the beginning to the end of the event it travelled approx.  20 degrees of a 360 degree radius of the sky. Initially due to the height of the peak it was framed against it was below the skyline and framed against the mountainside that was behind it.  Due to the contours of the mountain even though it was traveling on the horizontal, in a couple of seconds it was then seen with the sky as its backdrop.  What really struck me at first was the fact that this object was below the skyline which made it impossible for it to be no more than a few miles away and thus I automatically assumed it had to be a helicopter since many of them pass through that area.  Again, no sound and sound travels far in the desert and definitely no propellers or wings seen on the object.  When I saw it turn north it's speed and movement was not at all consistent with a helicopter since the turn and speed were too fast for a helicopter or even small plane.",

      "story": "Cigar shaped UFO spotted in Tucson, AZ on May 14, 2011. It was Saturday, May 14th, 2011 around 12:30pm. I was in the back seat, right side, of my friends\u2019 car travelling west on E. Speedway Boulevard, Tucson, AZ.  I believe I first spotted it near the intersection w/ Craycroft.  I saw one silvery-golden cylindrical metal craft that was shaped like a cigar or a cigarette ( long and thin).  It was flying in the same direction as we were travelling (westward) in the sky north of us. It was flying fast.  It was not all that high in the sky which made me think it was taking off or landing.  It was flying fairly level so it didn't appear to have just taken off or preparing for landing.  It appeared to have a thin stripe of an orange metallic color at the front and another thin orange stripe in the center.  There were no wings and we didn\u2019t her any plane noises.  I pointed it out to my friend who was in the front passenger seat and she also saw it.  I don\u2019t know if the driver saw it.  We watched it for a few blocks then it was ou! t of our view.  My friend and I are college counselors.",

On May 28th, 2011, at approximately 10:50 pm I was driving south on Country Club to meet my friend at a yogurt shop when I saw a white flash.  I presumed it was an intersection camera in front of me but when I went through the intersection there wasn\u2019t a camera, I thought it may have been a security light I drove by coming on and didn\u2019t think twice. At approximately 11:30 pm my friend and I were standing outside of the yogurt shop (BTO) that had closed at 11:00 pm talking.  I was facing south; he was facing north when I saw the white flash again, very evidently from the sky this time.  It lit up the entire sky instantaneously without a trail or identifiable direction.  It was brightest in a streak however that had a southwest by northeast direction.  Like the gradients you see in PowerPoint  presentations, it was brightest down the middle and slightly darker along the edges ( the horizon). My friend, a pilot, said, \"What the hell was that?\"  I was stunned he saw it also because it was so quick and he was facing the opposite direction.  It was faster than a camera flash, without the residual blinding effect.  I said, \"You saw it to?!,\" and he also said he lit up the whole sky. There were no discernable aircraft, no discernable sounds, no trails or residual proof and this was located north of Davis-Monthan Airforce Base.  There were no clouds visible in the area as all the stars were clearly shining.   I have two Bachelor of Science degrees from the University of Arizona and I am two years away from my Doctorate degree.  I am well versed in scientific observations and while I wish I could provide more detailed information the event happened astonishingly quick, on the order of microseconds.  Had my pilot friend not been there in awe with me, I may not have believed I saw anything in the first place.

      "story": "orange/red ufo over Tucson blinks out Arriving home from grocery shopping I exited the car and paused to admire the clear sky and stars.  I turned looking east toward the city.  We live out of Tucson up in the Tucson Mountain foothills and therefore we enjoy a wonderful view of the twinkling city lights.  I observe aircraft regularly but one light over the middle of Tucson caught my attention.  It was a ball of orange/red light moving at a typical plane speed traveling south to north.  I studied the movement and light trying to figure out it's color, orange or red?  It seemed to be organically shifting from more orange to more red.  I thought atmosphere may be tricking my eyes. It was a solid unblinking color.  For reference, there were two other typical planes in the sky over town at the same time and their white lights with blinking green and red lights were easily visible.  I was waiting to see the familiar plane blinking lights but none were seen.  A funny coincidence happened then when I was! startled to realize that this was no ordinary aircraft.  The amber light stopped moving as I felt an adrenaline wave.  I then noticed that it changed directions promptly and appeared to be headed west in my direction.  I sort of panicked and ran in to get my husband and our two boys out to see the \"UFO\".  Eventually they all came outside.  The light grew or glowed bigger as it approached, though still many miles away.  Although it seemed to be coming straight toward us it started to lose intensity and brightness growing smaller and smaller. Then we all saw the light as it blinked out, nowhere to be seen.  We looked and waited a few minutes for it to reappear but it did not show up anywhere.   My husband was a skeptic about ufo's until he saw this thing he could not understand.",

While watching for the asteroids i noticed a light north/north-east up in the sky, above and to the left of where Jupiter was last night, that was yellowish, and was moving left and right, down and up, waving, and behaving erratic. I quickly realized it wasn't an asteroid and called my boyfriends attention to it.  He too said that it looked to him like it was moving.   I then moved to put it in perspective with a near-by saguaro to really tell if it was moving, thinking maybe it was just our eyes playing tricks.  Sure enough it was moving to one side of the cactus, to the other. It was moving.  Then all of a sudden it was gone.  Then about 5 minutes later it reappeared, and this time it was higher in the sky, but in the same region.  We got in the car and drove about a mile towards it to get a better view.   It then started dimming, then brightening, sometimes disappearing, and returning quickly. Then it was gone.   We watched for about 10 minutes, and decided we didn't think it was coming back.  As we started to drive away, about 4-5 miles down the road, the light returned, dimming and brightening, until we turned down a street that no longer aloud us to see it.",

As I was fumbling through my purse for my house keys, my husband was behind me looking back at the sky.

Suddenly, he said &quot;look at that!&quot; When I turned around I saw a white light that was flying across the sky over a distant mountain. It definitely was flying at a slower speed than a shooting star but it looked like something similar.  I had enough time to turn around and witness it along with my husband.  All of a sudden, the light grew much, much brighter and in my opinion appeared to &quot;blast off&quot; from the original speed it was flying.

I jumped up off the couch telling my husband \u201cit\u2019s a huge meteor\u201d and ran for the front door never taking my eyes off of what I was seeing.   Even before I got to the front door 2 thoughts in secession went thru my mind.  The first was that this meteor was big and definitely gonna impact with a boom but then as I got closer to my picture window, which is right next to my front door, I had a second thought that this meteor did not look quite right.  What had appeared to be the fire tail just did not look like fire at all.   My husband had jumped up and grabbed his cell phone and was right behind me as I opened the front door.  As we stepped out onto the front porch this fire ball slowed down and slowly split into 5 or 6 very bright amber orbs and came to a complete stop hovering between my house and the Tucson Mt. range which is about 3 miles away.  I cannot tell you how long I would perceive this string of orbs to be except to say it was huge and would easily be seen in the night sky.   It hovered for about 3 seconds then turned itself horizontal and slowly sank behind one of the peaks of the Tucson Mt. ridge line.  It then came back up from behind the ridge still in a horizontal line but in a diagonal trajectory.  Slowly sank behind the ridge again and then came back up once more in a diagonal trajectory but only revealing 3 of it orbs this time.  It sank back down behind the ridge again and came up one last time only revealing part of 1 orb.  While we were watching this display take place my husband called his friend who lives on the other side of the Tucson Mt ridge (in town), he ran out to his back yard but did not see any lights dancing up and down in the sky.  I found that to be quite perplexing.  My husband was speaking with his friend while the orbs were still displaying themselves.   The next morning as I was leav! ing for work I noticed a smaller ridge between my house and th! e Tucson Mts. that I never really paid any attention to before and thought to myself that maybe these orbs were not actually dancing up and down behind the Tucson Mts but might possibly have been between this smaller ridge and the Tucson Mts.  A few days later I checked the internet to see if any one had posted any sightings and could not find any thing mentioned.  I am confident that had this happened where town could see it people would have been coming out of the wood work.  These orbs were huge and bright and seemed to be having some sort of fun time dancing up and down in the sky that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Sabino Canyon Tucson Arizona night UFO sighting. At approx. 21:00 on the night of Sun. June 16th, a friend and I decided to take a night hike of one mile up the paved tram road in Sabino Canyon just on the northeastern edge of Tucson, Az.  The night was totally cloudless and there was enough of a moon to illuminate the nearby mountains and distinguish the mountains from the sky above.  We walked to a turn in the road to a stunning view of the canyon towards the west.  As we proceeded just a few yards farther, I noticed a bright light directly on top of one of the flatter mountain mesas to the southwest.  I was wondering why someone was way up in an almost inaccessible location with a flashlight at that hour of the evening. The light proceeded to move at a walker's pace exactly on the top of the ridge line from left to right.  It then began to move faster than a walker's pace but still appeared to be flashlight size and right on the ridge line.  At times it would disappear and then suddenly reappear farther to the left on a consistent basis. The next time we looked towards that location, there was an object in the sky at 1/2 mile distance away just above the ridge line but very clearly in the sky and not on the ridge itself.  I could see it as more of a straight line than an object such as a saucer or anything definitive other than a faint, thin line in the sky.  I would have to estimate the length of this line as approx. 60 feet with a very faint red light on its end to the left and a very bright light on its right end.  It remained stationary for the rest of the event.  The red light stayed consistently very faint and clearly was not blinking in any fashion.  The white light however was laser precise and did not have the &quot;cheap&quot; star pattern glare of, say, a car headlight. The white light pulsed in an inconsistent way and changed randomly in its sizes.  This part of the event only lasted at the most half a minute.  My friend and I were excited but were also talking about what we had heard about ET experiences.  Many people have related that some alleged ETs are from the star system Zeta Reticula. I was just telling my friend that and precisely when I said the words, \"Zeta Reticula the light abruptly went out and in a split second made a big flash that my friend later said should have illuminated the mountain side due to its brightness.   The light after this went to the relative size it had been earlier. I don't recall how this \"object\" left but in the back of my mind I think it went more to the earlier flashlight sized light and then went out.  This object and lights made no sound whatsoever  and the canyon is a very, very quiet place.  From the beginning of the event to the end the object traversed at most 200 yards of ridge line.  We did not see anything else appear for the rest of our walk up and back. I'm 63 and work in retail.  My friend is in his 50's and is a professional therapist.  Both of us were wearing glasses but our vision is better than 20/20.  The night sky in this canyon is crystal, crystal clear.",

We pulled onto Park off of Valencia south by the airport where it was darker.  These were not airplanes or any type of craft we've seen.  The lights would appear in a row and fade away.  What really gave me the chills was when two lights appeared and one faded away on the right and one on the left had a few other lights appear right next to it and faded away looked like a circular craft with lights around it.

Time is fuzzy, not really sure how accurate but I usually get up around that time to let my cat in.  I sleep very odd hours, little bits at a time due to the nature of my job as a pharmacy tech at a VA Hospice, as sometimes I am on call. First object was pure white, it looked like a planet which is usually what I look for every night.  It had no twinkle like a star so I immediately went to it and watched it briefly and noticed it was moving and figured it was probably a meteor or a satellite.  It was almost directly over head toward East/Southeast, I had to tilt my head back to observe it.   At the same time this was going on, I noticed a solid red light further East/Northeast moving at the exact same speed as the white light.  Both faded out of sight, nothing real spectacular.   My father was an amateur astronomer so I'm a bit more familiar with stars/planets and other less interesting moving objects in the sky.  I also grew up near an airport and I'm sure it was not a plane as, again, neither lights blinked.  There were no physics defying movements, nothing flashy it just came out of nowhere and then faded out.  It all happen within 2 minutes or less.   I have an interest in UFOs but I am a skeptic as far as belief in ! alien life is concerned, not because I believe we're the only sentient lifeforms that exist but simply because of the apparent vastness of time and space.  This information is important because I've never reported anything like this before.  As an avid skywatcher in an amateur astronomer's heaven in a dimly lighted area of Southeast Arizona.  We do have a main street 2 blocks up and a facility right up the street that contributes to light pollution but other than that we have a pretty good view as opposed to other parts of Tucson and far better than most of Metropolitan Phoenix.",

      "story": "Tucson sighting from Catalina Foothills:  4 lights, triangle formation, moving low and silent in a northwest direction in the Tucson sky Our Tucson apartment is on Sunrise Drive between Swan and Craycroft.  Sunrise is a main road that runs east to west along the base of the Catalina Mountains and Swan (to the west of our apt) and Craycroft (to the east) are roads that run perpendicular north and south.  Tues night (3/4/14) at 7:39pm, my son was sitting on our third-floor, south-facing apt balcony.  From the balcony, which faces Sunrise, we have a panoramic view that includes city lights to the southwest, Davis-Montham/TIA lights to the south, and Tucson Mountains to west.   At around 7:39, my son noticed what appeared to be a large triangle-shaped \"craft\" with 3 point lights (spaced evenly apart in a straight line) along the back and a single light at what would be the point of the triangle or front of \"craft\".  This large, expansive-looking \"craft\" was moving slowly and silently at an angle over Swan heading northwest in the direction of I-10.   He immediately called me as he was watching it and I happened to be driving north on Craycroft towards Sunrise with a friend following two cars back.  All the way up Craycroft to the light at Sunrise (about 1 mile), I was unable to see anything and thought he was exaggerating.   However, as I turned left to go west on Sunrise, there it was up ahead directly in front of me up in the sky.  My view of it was of the back three lights only as it moved away from my direction, heading west over Sunrise.  I did not see the front point light.   A Pima County Sheriff's Supervisor SUV had been directly behind me at the Craycroft/Sunrise light and as soon he turned the corner behind me, he gave one blast of the siren, stomped on the gas, cutting around me and the car to the left, racing up Sunrise in that direction.   I reached home in about three minutes and it had already disappeared from my view.  My friend, who had been behind the Sheriif, had seen it as well as soon as we turned on Sunrise.  My son, however, said he watched all four lights seemingly disappear and ran to the other side of the building but it was not visible after that from any direction.   Nothing on the news or anywhere today about this.  We've seen odd lights in the sky before from the balcony but never anything like this.",

While getting things out of my car trunk for a night walk up the canyon, I looked to the SE over the very eastern edge of SE Tucson and saw a bright orange light about 3 times the size of Venus in the night sky.  The light was  self contained, laser precision and didn't have the star burst glare of plane headlights.  Even though it was self contained and was not emitting a flame in any way, it had the characteristics of being somewhat on fire. This light proceeded towards me from about 10 miles away and then turned and went up into the cloud layer above the nearby Rincon Mtns.  The event lasted about 45 seconds. Just a few seconds later another identical light appeared from behind a nearby hill again to the SE of me but farther west than the first object.  It seemed to be coming up right out of the city itself since it started so low.  Again it travelled somewhat towards me and then went up gradually in the clouds above the Rincons. By this time I had my binoculars out and noted that it had no running lights or any other colored lights around it.  This one took about one minute from start to finish of the sighting. Then yet another one appeared even farther to the west but this time was seen IN FRONT OF a very small hill just 2 to 3 miles away.  It then proceeded for 1 minute to climb up into the cloud layers above the Rincons traveling for one minute or less. There was no wind other than a mile zephyr breeze of 1 to 2 miles an hour.  All of these objects travelled several miles of sky in less than a minute each thus ruling out Chinese lanterns.  Also, it rules out that they came from Davis Monthan AFB since the last light was seen starting its course in front of the hill just a couple miles from me and also the AFB is located farther west from where the first 2 came from.

At dusk, on February 18, 2014, at 19:16, local time, while out for my evening walk, I spotted 3 orange orbs, approximately 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon, to the west, south west of my position, roughly 6 miles south of Picture Rocks, AZ. These lighted orange orbs were near my winter home, west of Tucson, AZ, and this was not my first sighting. The 3 orange orbs first appeared by blinking on; first just one, then two, and then three, total.  All 3 briefly became visible at the same time.  First one would blink on, then another, and so on, then one would blink off then back on in random sequence etc.  All three were totally silent, and left no visible smoke, plasma trail or contrail etc. While visible, they appeared to have a very low ground speed, however, with no range or size information, I could not determine their exact speed, altitude or location.  They were arranged in an approximate north/south line from my vantage point, looking west southwest toward the fading sunset, and they did not dart or zoom back and forth. They were only in view for a few seconds, and I pulled out my cell phone to photograph them, but it was too dark.  All three then blinked out within 30 seconds or so, and I noted the time as 19:16, on my cell phone. Having occasionally seen these groups of reddish orange orbs at this location before, I attempted to take a photograph this time, because the sightings appear to be occurring more and more frequently, during the three years I have been wintering over here. There is a lot of regular air traffic in this area, from SWA B-737's, AAL MD-80's, to CRJ 50 and 700 series commuter jets, plus a lot of G/A traffic going into TUS, and Ryan Airfield, located 10nm South and Marana Airport, about 11nm north. I also spot numerous military aircraft over flying this area daily, including KC-135's, C-130's, F-16's, A-10's, Blackhawks and Cobra helicopters etc., mostly operating out of DM AFB or TUS. Additionally, both my neighbor and I operate Hot Air balloons, (mine is a Balloon Works AX-8-B,  90,000 cubic feet) so I am quite familiar with the local traffic patterns, and most types of aircraft in this area. I am also familiar with the difference in color spectrum between tungsten, XENON, HALOGEN, and LED landing lights, and or position/strobe lights, which these orange orbs were not. Just prior to this sighting, there was a flight of two A-10 Warthogs, departing Davis Monthan AFB, on their routine evening patrol.   I see them often, and can recognize them by their two distinctive white flashing strobes. The A-10's were climbing away from my position, westbound, in loose formation, about 250 to 300 knots, at approximately 10,000 feet.  As they disappeared to the west, the orbs appeared behind them, a few minutes later. Shortly after the orbs briefly appeared, and then blinked out, I noticed a small single engine aircraft, southbound, approximately 5 to 10 miles west of my position, around 5 to 7 thousand feet.  I could hear its single engine, and see its steady red position light, as well as its red anti-collision light flashing.  Its ground speed appeared to be 80 to 110 kts but it was too dark to determine the specific type. This aircraft may be the reason for the orbs blinking out, because it appeared to fly through the same area, shortly after the orbs disappeared.  I continued watching for them to reappear, as I walked about two miles back home (approximately 15 min's)  By then it was completely dark, and the objects did not reappear. Over the past 3 years, I have seen these objects around half a dozen times, usually in groups of two to five objects, to the west of my home, mostly in the evening, or early morning hours, and generally low on the west southwest horizon, as opposed to overhead. These internally lit, orange orbs were not parachute flares, balloons, helicopters, fixed wing jets or reciprocating G/A aircraft. They were also not candle powered toy hot air balloons, which my neighbors launch in the evening, from time to time. Having watched the Apollo-17 night launch in person, (DEC 1972), two shuttle launches, and one night shuttle reentry over the South Pacific, (Eileen Collins, Commander), plus a couple of Vandenburg, AFB night missile launches, I am certain these orbs were not chemical powered rockets, either lifting off or on reentry, or the space station. Also they are not the Moon or Venus, Mars, Jupiter, or Sirius etc. (wrong color, wrong location)  I can reasonably eliminate all the objects, planets, aircraft and vehicles that I have listed in this report, but I cannot identify what these orbs are. After waiting a little over one hour, I called the hotline and made a verbal report to Peter Davenport around 20:42 local time. I have not previously made a formal report, due to my position in professional aviation. I have seen these orange orbs often enough to confirm they are not my imagination, and feel that my report should be made now, because the sightings appear to be happening more and more frequently. If I were here full time, and had the time to spend looking, I feel that I could probably spot them fairly often in this area.  (just my speculation)  Because I am actively employed in a professional flying position, I must remain anonymous, however, I am more than willing to speak with an investigator. Thanks for taking my report and I hope it is useful. My background:  ATP, I started flying early 1970's; 26,000 + hours.  Worldwide.

My family (2 adults, 2 small children) were driving in the Catalina foothills north of Tucson, Arizona, and I (the passenger) observed what I thought was a small campfire on the mountainside.   We drove up the road to get a better look and so that I could report it to the sheriff's office, but as we approached it became clear that the fire was actually a large orb of red and orange light.   When we were as close as we could be at the top of the road, the object lifted off the mountainside and flew very quickly over our car, but it was nowhere to be seen when I stepped out to see where it went. Spooked, we went back down a side street to turn around and leave.  As we got back to the main road though, the red and orange orb was back hovering over the mountainside again where it \"blinked\" off and back on occasionally.  It appeared fairly close but made no sound at all.   This went on for about ten minutes before we drove away not wanting to scare the kids who were already a little shaken by it.",

A couple of minutes later I looked to where the western edge of the Catalina Mtns meets the edge of NW Tucson which was about 25 miles from my position and I saw a large, bright orange light suddenly \"turn on\" similar to a light switch being turned on.  A half second later another on came on just a short distance in the sky to the left of the first and then a third all staying on at the same time and in a straight line.  They were just above the horizon line but clearly in the sky. The lights were about 5 times the size of Venus in the night sky and were not emitting the star burst glare of a plane headlight but were more self contained and laser precision.  From seeing videos of the Phoenix Lights incident from the 1990's these lights turned on in progression similar to those.

We set up a couple of camping chairs on the edge of the road so that we could look at the night sky to the north east and have a conversation. At about 19:30 I turned my gaze to the north and saw a white light in the sky at about 10:00 above the horizon.  The light was moving slowly from north to south and appeared to be both below and in some clouds that peppered the otherwise clear sky.  The light was soft white with no blinking running lights and did not have the bright glare of an airplane headlight.  It looked similar to a satellite but was about 3 to 5 times larger.  There was no sound. If one were to hold their arm out and spread their fingers to about 4 inches, that would be the distance this object travelled.  It then faded out at the end and disappeared.  From our vantage point this object was moving more towards us than away. A couple of minutes later I looked at the same location and saw a light that looked exactly the same but this time it was headed at a 90 degree angle from where the first one was seen to fade out and this one went about the same distance from east to west and faded out as well. At about 20:00 my attention again was drawn to this location in the sky and another white light was moving very slowly from east to west again seeming to be in the clouds and not above them.  This one was seen for a longer duration of 3 minutes where the others were viewed for just under a minute each.  This 3rd light disappeared into the clouds and my friend G*** said it should be coming out of the clouds at a break in them at any moment.  We never saw the object again even though its trajectory should have had it come out at a good sized piece of cloudless sky. The next night (Thanksgiving) our local channel 4 TV station aired a report about strange lights over Tucson on 11/28.",

Within a few seconds, 2 more identical orange lights appeared to the right of the first 2 in a very slight downward arc. I couldn't judge distance but it appeared that the lights were possibly 10-15 miles distant.  The lights were striking in appearance in that they were bright and didn't conform in nature to anything normally seen with conventional airborne objects.  I grabbed a camera close by, opened my garage door and stepped out on my driveway.  The lights had disappeared.  However, approximately 10 miles to the south of that position, an orange light appeared very low in the sky. It disappeared and reappeared within a few seconds in that location.  About 60 seconds later, it appeared about 30 miles NW of that position once again as an orange light near the KITT Peak Observatory area.  Within abou! t 5 minutes of my observation, I observed (and heard) 2 USAF jets in the exact same area of my original sighting.  The jets circled the city of Tucson from what I could tell for about 10 minutes.  There were no further sightings at this point.",

      "story": "Unusual Lights Above Catalina Mountains in Tucson At approximately 8pm in the northern Tucson area of Sabino Canyon, while observing the night sky, a friend of mine and I witnessed a dull whitish light moving in a southerly direction towards the city of Tucson.  At the time of the sighting, it was located almost directly over the mid section of the Catalina Mountains north of Tucson. The light did not have the characteristics of a 'beam' with a ray emanating forward, but rather that of a glowing effect that was constant in luminescence.  Estimating height would put it at several miles up however there was insufficient evidence to make more than a guess. It moved very slowly relative to what one might see from an airliner or even that of a small plane.  There were no strobe lights seen during this sighting and no other color was present than the dull white glow.  No sound could be heard either. As we watched its flight path, it moved towards, and eventually into, a small cloud. Fully expecting to see it emerge on the other side of this small cloud I was surprised to see nothing emerge. When the cloud moved on, there was no light anywhere in the area. A short time later, we again witnessed what appeared to be another light in the same general area and same characteristics as the first only moving somewhat perpendicular to that of the first object's path. This time there was no cloud in the object's path but after a couple of minutes, it just faded to nothing. Both objects seemed to travel about the same distance in their respective directions before disappearing.  Both were larger relative to the 'moving spot' one sees when a satellite passes overhead.  Logical assumptions as to expected characteristics of these moving objects did not seem to apply when trying to put them in a frame of context for normal plane or helicopter flight.",

Some of the lights appeared to leave momentary trails of white behind as they zoomed across the sky.  Then some of the blue lights, about 3 or 4 of them to the left blinked on a bright vibrant transparent light above them and looked like a dome shape.  On and off very quickly ... then the blue lights appeared to have a brilliant red light right next to or within it.   The lights danced across the foothills up down all around in various areas.  Then some of the red lights had beams of red light flash on and off here and there.  To my visible eye, these beams were only a couple of inches long beaming down, but could have been yards or more.   I have never seen anything like this in my lifetime.  The strangest thing is that to my eyes these flashes of light would have all appeared separate.   But this morning I awoke and had the strongest impression and feeling that this was ONE invisible craft like a long almond shape, where all this was taking place.  All these lights stayed within this one area, flashing on and off.  If it was a craft it had to be miles long.",

I walked out my front door (which faces east toward the Santa Catalina Mountains) about 8 pm to let my dog relieve himself.  There are no street lights in this area so it was quite dark.  As I was facing east, there was a brilliant fluorescent green fireball that streaked in a downward arch toward the north.  I just saw it for a couple seconds before it went behind a neighbors large tree.  There are mountains that line most of my east view and it arched below the level of the mountain ridge.  I didn't see any sign of the fireball after it passed behind the tree.  It appeared to be some distance away (about 3 miles), but was quite large compared to the usual air traffic lights I've seen in this area (all manner of private, commercial, and military planes and helicopters).  As it was only green, it did not resemble any aircraft light I have previously seen, both in configuration, size, or hue.  As I have been around military aircraft my whole life and am a pri! vate pilot I am quite familiar with the color and formation of running lights and this was in no way one I have ever seen before.  It is pretty quiet here as there are no major roads or traffic around here, especially at this time of night, so it was quite easy to observe that there was no associated sound with this.  Shortly after seeing this I saw and heard a couple firetrucks speeding in that direction although I don't know if that is where they ultimately were headed, especially since there are no roads that I know of that would have taken them to the area I saw the light.",

Possible Ufo sighting by me tue 8 apr 2014, 2:50pm, 20 miles north of Tucson, AZ.  \"UFO\"- for me doesn't mean \"unidentified\" since most planes and other flying objects are \"unidentified\" as to tail number, etc.. I prefer to call the \"U\" in UFO   \"Unusual\" or \"Unexpected\" or maybe  OFO, Odd Flying Object.  This object didn't \"fly\"- it appeared (or I noticed it) and disappeared. I was on a dirt road at 2:50pm on april 8th.  As I turned north, I saw in a mostly clear blue sky, straight ahead and about 30% above level (landscape here too irregular landscape to call it \"horizon\"), a wisp of cloud about 2\" long horizontally at extended thumb and forefinger, about 1/2\" high.  As I looked at it the center became a bright silver, irregular shaped, like metal shining through the cloud.  The silver disappeared back into the cloud and the cloud shrank in both dimensions and disappeared.   Total time from when I noticed the cloud to total disappearance about 8 seconds.  This was not a reflection off a windshield.  I've never seen a cloud disappear like this. Sun at this time of day was on the left, a little forward of 90deg left. There is an airbase south of here (Davis Monthan), and I regularly see planes from there, but but I've never seen one manifest itself from within a small cloud and then both disappear.  Most planes here are not shiny. This was diffent from anything I've seen before in the sky. It is the first truly odd thing I've ever seen in the sky. Oddly, it left me slightly disquieted, almost a prickling of the hair. I'm 68, retired, former electronics engineer, former computer tech with a missionary organization, formerly lived several places in U.S., Costa Rica, Peru, Mexico. I used to be a student pilot, failed to get license only due to time sched for leaving for Peru. I'm familiar with UFO lore, but never seen anything unusual, and have no particular desire to.

It was a clear night and we counted at least six white lights that were flickering at what seemed to be a much faster rate than ordinary commercial or military aircraft.  My first thought was that maybe Tucson Airport (or possibly Davis-Monthan Air Force base) was experiencing some kind of incident on a runway causing air traffic to backup and circle in a holding pattern.  This was not the case.  Soon it was clear that these lights were not \"flying\" but hovering in place.   Not too long after the shimmering lights had appeared, a larger, bright orange light materialized beneath them.   Then things got a bit stranger.  The large orange light appeared to split into two distinct orbs, each retaining the same shape and color of the original.  In a matter of seconds the two lights merged together again into a single orb before vanishing along with the twinkling background lights.   At this point my wife was more concerned about my staying on the road because I was starting to swerve in and out of my lane.  The best that I could tell is that at least some of the twinkling lights flew into the larger orange light.  I couldn't believe what we were seeing.   As I exited Houghton Rd. we parked to see if the activity was still continuing.  We saw nothing.   As I started driving North on Houghton I looked into my rear-view mirror and saw the orange light appearing once again.

      "story": "Daylight disc  seen in clear morning sky for and hour and a half. My wife and I went out to have our coffee on our patio Sunday morning. I sat on a lounge chair under a Cabana frame with no top cover on it. I laid back at some point and noticed a large White spot in the Sky.  Time was about 08:00. It was cool about 70 degrees and only one wisp of a cloud in the sky near the object.  I thought it to be a weather balloon and noted where it was in relation to the frame of the cabana.  It was at ZENITH in the sky. I went in for a second cup of Joe and grabbed a pair of 7x50 binoculars to view that balloon.  Time then was about 08:15am and the object HAD NOT MOVED...  I adjusted the glasses (German) on a mountain top I knew was 5 miles from home, then I looked at the object...IT WAS A DISC!  My wife looked as well and thought she saw one wing stick out.  The DISC looked to be the size of a half dollar coin from this view with the field glasses. Silvery-white outer color and blue gray towards the center with a very BLACK center.  The view was crystal clear and no fuzzy images at all.  Still it had not moved from zenith. When I went for a third cup I grabbed my Nikon \"Coolpix\" electronic camera.  I had to step away from the frame so the auto focus would allow me to find that Disc.  At infinity the detail was 70% less than the field glasses but I was able to see a little bit of a ring like feature.  Looking again through the glasses I could see in detail a wedge forming in a dark color over the disc.  Thing changed details within the circle but only in color as far as we could tell.  Time was about 08:40am.  At this time I went back under the cabana frame to track any movement, It had moved about 2 degrees from Zenith towards the WEST.  I clicked off several photos and went inside to answered the telephone. With all this the wife and I were not sure that it wasn't a balloon and just Odd that it had not moved.  I PLANNED to call pilots' weather service, and get a \"Winds Aloft\" Report for southern Arizona...I failed to do so. At 09:15 I returned outside and it had not move but another 1 degree West. I went to my laptop and down loaded the photos and tried to enlarge them...UNTIL my laptop's security program had lapsed and (POP UPs) blocked everything I tried to do with the laptop.  I went outside and it was gone.  Time was 09:59I am not tech savvy with electronics and gave up for a while until tonight.  Almost 10 days now. I'll try to down load the photos I took.  Hope you all can enlarge them for your use.",

It had lights around outside bottom of disc, and 4 hemispherical protrusions, and bright bluish light in the center bottom. I was totally amazed to watch the lightning strike the craft several times, and noticed when the light reflected off the highly polished metallic surface.   I yelled for my mother, who came running, and we then watched the craft for about 3 or 4 minutes through the backdoor window.  Then it slowly moved upwards thru the clouds and vanished.  My father, who was retired from air force 3 years earlier, was told the story next day, and was very interested.  I remember parents talking about an article in the local newspaper the following day, where hundreds of people saw the same thing.   I have never been able to find article, but i know what I saw, and it was the real deal, an unforgetable experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

In the night sky there were 6 to 8 ORBS reddish in color moving silently to the NNW. the were over the Tucson mid-town area.  Davis Monthan AFB is in that area.   I thought at first it was the Pima County Patrol aircraft (a turbo prop). However it was all red ORBS not red and green NAV lights nor did they blink.  Also, the Sherriff's aircraft has white strobes anti-collision markers. The object moved NNW then without a stop, retraced its path.  In a few more seconds it started straight UP.  It was a steady glide at no \"Super sonic Speeds\" just a fast rate until it was undiscernible from the stars.  It was a New or full moon and there was a reddish star or planet at the moon's 8 o'clock. I tried to make my own investigation and am not convinced that a \"Drone Octicopter: was the object, because the ORBS didn't have border \"FUZZ\" as the lights in my area have, ie: stop lights, aircraft & tower markers.  Furthermore, the SCALES would not support a toy aircrafts size.  I had very good sight reference points. I tried to make a report to MUFON but they said \" you have done your own research\".",

      "story": "Bright lights seen over the Catalina Mtns. north of Tucson On July 4th, 2015, at approx. 21: 00, we witnessed a light display above the eastern portion of the Catalina Mtns. north of Tucson, Az.  We were sitting in chairs at the western edge of the Sabino Canyon parking lot and had just watched the fireworks display that  Ventana Canyon Resort puts on for guests.  The sky was heavily overcast over the mountains so when I saw a bright white light appear over the mountains just to the west of the radio towers, I thought it best to turn on my 5X night vision camera and see what it was and I began recording. It was actually 2 lights nearly together in a stationary position far out over the mountains which was easy to tell since the lights were in focus but the radio towers were not since they were closer even though still a few miles away.  Immediately when I turned on the camera, there was a big blue flash near the right side of the lights.  I then zoomed in on the lights and the 2 lights gradually became three in a perfectly spaced row. My camera was mounted on a tripod so the light appeared steady and not moving in the video and that can be gauged also by its relation to the top of the mountain seen below it.  Clearly these lights were in the sky and are not on the mountain itself.   There were big flashes of green lights both near the lights but also well away from them.  Later a similar set of lights appeared out of nowhere next to the original lights to the left of them and when they did the original lights themselves flashed as a large green light. This second set of lights then began to disappear and became a single red light that could be seen moving towards the original lights before it went out.  While trying to get my camera in a better focus there was suddenly a flurry of large flashing lights on all sides of the original lights. The original 3 lights continued to stay in the same place in the sky for a few minutes more and then my camera ran out of memory.  The lights didn't do anything unusual after that but eventually just turned off abruptly.  After about  half an hour the lights came back on in the same location with one bright white light appearing and then 4 more gradually forming a straight line of lights.  They did the same large flashes of light and they appeared to move independently from each other. Lights were seen suddenly appearing and coming from the sides towards the row of lights.  This display lasted several minutes and then just like the first event they all went out like a light switch had been activated. I was with one other person who witnessed the events in a similar way as I did since we were both commenting on what we saw as it occurred.  I wear glasses but my vision is very good.  I'm 66 and am in retail sales.  The other witness is in his 50's and is in the medical sales field.  I've included my YouTube video with this report so feel free to post it on the NUFORC site.",

I just noticed to the West a sea foam green bright light with my husband & neighbors at just about 7:15pm-7:17pm over the CAP canal, next to Ryan\u2019s Air Field, on Bopp Rd. in Tucson, Arizona.  It was a light that seemed to come in towards us slowly, then it backed out as fast as it had appeared-finally fading to black (full night sky).  The entire experience lasted about 15 minutes, as the glow remnant took this long to dissipate fully. At first we thought that we were witnessing an aircraft/drone (silent) headed directly towards us at about 25mph due to a bright whitish-green \u201cspotlight\u201d approaching us. The spotlight had a bright green line\\in its center.  It startled & frightened us.  Then it reversed, heading backwards as fast as it had come in. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD))",

      "story": "Red-orange lights being followed by helicopter I was sitting in my house watching TV at 1:05am on Tuesday 10/20/15 in the outskirts of the SW Tucson, AZ area, when I heard a helicopter noise steadily growing even louder.  As I am sitting next to the large picture window, I looked out between the blinds to see 2 small reddish-orange lights moving off to the west, followed by a helicopter with a red & green solid, non-blinking lights. As they were approaching from the city center area of Tucson, I was able to see a dark shape around the red & green lights, showing the shape of the helicopter, with the city glow directly behind it, but I saw no dark shape around either of the small red-orange lights that would determine the approximate size or shape of the craft it was attached to.  Also, the distance between the 2 red-orange lights was slightly larger than the distance between the 2nd red-orange light and the helicopter lights and the 2 red-orange lights were offset, with the first one slightly more north than the 2nd one, but the helicopter lights were in a straight line directly behind the 2nd red-orange light. I distinctly heard one helicopter noise, not several.  As the noise was louder than I can ever remember hearing at this location, as well as the fact that the green & red helicopter lights were large, I believe the helicopter was flying low in the sky as it went directly over my house. I do live near a small airfield called Ryan Airfield, which is 2 to 3 miles southwest of my location, so I am used to seeing small prop planes and small helicopters flying over this area, but never that low or loud.   These lights were not going towards Ryan Airfield to the SW, but almost directly west, maybe slightly north of directly west.   I, on occasion, have also seen military planes and helicopters flying over this area, as we do have both an Air Force base and Air National Guard base located in Tucson, but they never fly this low, and usually are in groups of 3 or more.   With these helicopter groups, it almost sounds like an echo from multiple rotors, but I didn't hear that echo on this occasion. I wrote down the description of this occurrence immediately after it happened, so the details were fresh in my mind. On a separate note, in the 9 years I have lived in this house, maybe 8-10 times I have heard a loud sonic boom type noise that rattled my house to the extent that on a few of these occasions, I ran outside to see if a car had run into my house.  I used to write these sonic boom noises to military aircraft, but as I have heard reports of these noises on Coast to Coast AM, I am not so sure of that hypothesis, especially since I have never witnessed an aircraft to accompany these loud banging noises.  Most of these booms happened during daylight, as several woke me up since I work graveyard shift and sleep usually from sunrise to early afternoon.",

      "story": "Creature attempted to enter house. This event occurred at about 1:10 AM on March 14, 1997, about 18 miles southwest of Tucson, Arzona.  At that time, I was a 42 year old electronic engineer. who operated a small home business, doing contract jobs for various clients.  I had lived in Tucson for some time, and felt that the city was too noisy for me to concentrate on my work.  I wanted to live in a quiet rural area where I would not be disturbed, and in 1996 I purchased a house in a sparsely populated area southwest of town. I had a neighbor across the road from me, and there was an unoccupied house furthur to the north.  My property extended about 100 feet from the front of the house, and then there was a barbed wire fence.  It had 5 wires, the top one being about 4 feet high.  It was usually quite dark at night out there, however I had installed some floodlights on the front of the house, which I could turn on if needed. I went to bed around 10 PM, March 13, and was sleeping soundly when the event began. I was awakened around 1:10 AM, March 14, by the sound of someone attempting to open the bedroom window, about 6 feet away from me.  The sound was like nails on a blackboard.  The window was on the front of the house, and consisted of double-pane glass with track-locks on it, and a set of blinds which were closed.  Although I could not see who was trying to get in, I had a profound feeling of being in danger... as if whoever was outside specifically intended to do something bad to me.  I've always had a good sensitivity to the feelings of people and animals, and I was confident that what I felt was genuine. As quickly as I could, I rolled out of bed, away from the direction of the window, and grabbed a 12 gauge shotgun from the closet.  At this time my emotions changed from fear to intense anger and a strong determination to kill the attempted intruder, if he got in.  I pumped a shell into the chamber, which made an audible noise, then ran to the living room window, which was only about 10 feet from the bedroom window, also on the front of the house.  That was where the switch for the floodlights was located. I hit the switch, and was totally shocked when I saw a creature, which was now moving away from the house towards the fence.  I got a pretty good look at the back of it, for about 5 seconds.  It was definitely not human.  It was about 6-7 feet tall and had a large head, similar in shape to a football helmet.  It was very thin and the arms were quite long.  It wasn't exactly running, but it was moving smoothly and very quickly. It reached the fence in just a few seconds, and then, without slowing down, it jumped right over it, like a hurdle jumper in the Olympics, and kept on going.  It continued down to the wooded area where the unoccupied house was, and within about 30 seconds I saw a disk shaped object rise up from there, and move off towards the south. It was about 30-40 feet in diameter and passed by the front of my house at a distance of about 130 feet, about 60-80 feet above the ground.  It had steady yellow-redish lights on the bottom of it and made no sound that I could hear. I mentally collapsed into a state of total shock and an overwhelming feeling of fear.  All I could think of was what might happen if it came back.  I spent the rest of the night hiding behind a couch in the living room, clutching the shotgun. When the sun began to come up, I started to come to my senses. I carefully went outside and looked around.  Everything seemed normal, except that by my bedroom window I found some footprints.  There hadn't been much rain and the ground was rather hard, but a few of the impressions were fairly clear.  The prints were about 10-11 inches in length, very thin, and with 3 large toes. I decided to go to a hardware store and get some bolt locks to secure the doors.  This I did, and on the way back I stopped at a small cafe a few miles from my house, to pick up some coffee and breakfast.  I entered the cafe, ordered some food, and then noticed that a casual friend of mine was there.  He lived in a trailer a few miles to the south of me.  When I saw him I simply said \"Man, something really weird happened last night,\" and he replied, \"You're not kidding... a UFO came up the canyon\". I was startled to hear that, and asked him, \"What time?\" and he replied, \"about a quarter past 1.\"  When he said that, I panicked and left the cafe without even taking my coffee or food.  (Several months later I actually tried to find him, to ask him for more details, but I was told he had left the area back in March...immediately after the event had occurred.)   Anyway, I returned to the house, and installed the locks on the doors.  The following day I went into town and purchased a bunch of heavy plywood, and boarded up every window in the house. I considered reporting the incident, but I was doing some electronic design work for the military, and I was afraid that I might be typed as a lunatic or a security risk and lose my clearance... and in addition, I simply had no desire to talk about it.",

The lights disappeared at 20:52 and further recordings showed no more lights in the same area as our first recording with the two lights.

Suddenly it appeared in the upper right field of my vision.  I saw a gray disk with a plate-like central part on the undersurface.  There was some type of inscription on this central part.  No running lights.   But, an orange aura slowly formed starting at the outer border of the UFO.  The orange aura slowly expanded for about six or seven seconds, held its position for a couple of seconds, then slowly regressed to the body of the UFO.   It repeated this orange aura expansion-regression process about ten times.   Then, the UFO disappeared.  My wife was nearby.  I described this occurrence to her as it was actually happening.  This is the only time I had this sighting.  I don't drink or take drugs.  My eyes were closed during this entire episode. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report describes himself as a retired military officer.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello,  I have not experienced any similar sensations regarding UFOs, but I've had many different synchronistic happenings which have astounded me.  I narrated this one UFO phenomenon in real time to my wife as it was unfolding.  My wife says she has never experienced anything that might be considered preternatural.  I want to emphasize that in this UFO experience what I saw was a clearly-defined physical entity rather than the results of an eye pathology.  The object I viewed from the underneath vantage had some type of scribbling in its central circular area.  I have listened on Coast-to-Coast to your reports of physical sightings.  I was somewhat hesitant to send you my report because I saw the object with my eyes closed. Could it be that there is a psrapsychical dimension to my experience?  I'm open to all possibilities...even way-out bizarre ones.  Have you ever had anyone express to you anything like my experience?.... ((END ADDENDUM))",

They were moving across the sky, west to east, but very slowly.  I could see no lights, typical to any aircraft flying at night, and I strained to hear any kind of aircraft noise and could not.  I watched them travel east and then sort of disappear or fizzle out. I continued with my groceries and then noticed two more of the same.  A few minutes later, two more and then two more came more quickly.  All had the same characteristics and moved slowly, almost as if floating across the sky. Just before the final four spheres crossed, another small aircraft came into the space from a more northwest direction.  However, the path of this plane took it right next to these spheres, so it had to have seen them as it passed two of them. The final four spheres also traveled slowly to the east before fizzling out. I thought maybe our Air Force base was doing some new kind of craft experiment or they were weather balloons.  The only different thing was that at the end, I believe I could see tiny lights around the spheres, very tiny, almost like diamonds or little stars, but they were moving, too.

On Thursday, July 7th, 2016, two friends and I were leaving the Star Pass Resort in the Tucson Mountains, west of Tucson, at about 9:30 or so.  After having dinner there, we walked out the east side of the resort headed to the parking lot.  We looked up into the northeastern sky to see a group of \u201cstars\u201d all of moderate intensity among thin wispy clouds centered about 40 degrees above the horizon line.  Because the night was partly cloudy, there were very few stars visible and I found it quite odd to see so many visible \u201cstars\u201d of similar intensity grouped equidistant from one another.  I thought there were about 14-16 lights. One of my two friends believed there were more than 20. He then exclaimed that they were slowly moving.  I looked closer, comparing the relative proximity of two of the lights and was amazed to find he was correct. At that moment, a bright blue light, the brightness of a significant meteorite and much brighter than the other lights, fell straight down, zig zagging slightly before it disappeared from our line of vision behind a wing of the hotel.  At that moment, two other bright blue lights of similar intensity passed over our heads on parallel paths.  We were swearing in amazement quite a bit at this moment.  They continued steadily across the sky until they met up with the more distant, dimmer lights in the misty cloud bank to the northeast.  This took about 15 seconds.  When they joined the other lights they took on the same level of light intensity.  Then they all faded away simultaneously. I am a native of Tucson, 47 years old with a Master\u2019s degree.

I watched it as i knew it was out of place, with planes blinking in the background and stars pulsing around.  Suddenly the movement was more obvious and it started to dim and it did, like a light bulb being turned off it dimmed into a dull point and disappeared in the matter of 2-3 seconds and was gone.  Like it went up.  I saw a similar incident 10 days ago but it disappeared behind a tree to the east.   18 months ago i saw something similar, but appeared more like a slow motion shooting star, going upwards.  Even saw a small fire trail. I watch planes and helicopters almost every night, seen meteors and shooting stars.  You learn flight paths and how to identify these things.  And also like the 3 incidents I mentioned you can tell what seems backwards or unnatural (including inhuman as far as we know).   Just wish i could see these in the day, seems I only see them shortly after night fall and only within the atmosphere.

      "story": "Light sphere becomes hawk. March 28, around 12:30 PM I was at my dining table working on my laptop.  The room became very very dark, quite quickly, as if a large and very thick cloud was passing over.   However, the fact it became so dark, so quickly, and cast my dining room into such deep shadow, felt so unusual to me that I decided to go outside to my patio to see just how large a cloud might be passing over.   Even though it was a windy day and there were scattered white clouds in the area, a cloud capable of such a shadow just didn\u2019t seem logical to me.  When I got outside and out from under my veranda roof, I did take note of a large cloud moving away from the sun but as the sun was still partially shrouded the cloud I couldn\u2019t look directly at it\u2026 the sun was too bright.  The cloud was moving northeast and the sun was high and to the south. A very large red-tailed hawk attracted my attention, soaring against a clear blue background of open sky at about 1000 feet or so, and slightly to the north.  Its markings were clear and distinct, a beautiful thing to witness, so I whistled a hawk call, twice.  It turned, and I whistled the call again.  At that time a bright sphere appeared far above the soaring hawk, a point of light, bright, white\u2026  Not bright like a star or a landing light.  But it was a point of light, very unusual\u2026 so I fixated on it.  I focused on it for around five to seven seconds, and observed it grow in size, and it didn't move much either.   Then a streak appeared to extend from the right side of this ball of light, like a flare, and I recall thinking I would describe flare as \u201cfeathery\u201d.  All at once the white sphere seemed to flash, to expand and was gone, and then, in its place and right next the soaring hawk that had originally attracted my attention, appeared an identical hawk.  They soared in formation for a bit, criss-crossing paths, something I'd seen before, and after 20-30 seconds the original hawk turned and headed to the south/southwest.  The hawk that had just appeared turned north and I lost sight of it. I know the human eye can play tricks on the mind, and there may well be a logical and natural explanation for this sighting.  The other hawk may have been far above the first, and out of focus in an empty field of blue sky considering my eyes were moving, following the first hawk.  It is possible the second hawk decided to dive directly down to join the other and was backlit by the sun as it dove.  But for this to happen right overhead, as I was calling to the first hawk... strange.  I am not given to fantasy or wishful thinking\u2026  I was a 3000+ hour USAF pilot, and after that, an engineer for McDonnell-Douglas and Boeing.  I retired from Boeing 10 years ago.  I have a degree in Biological Sciences and am somewhat well grounded in the basic sciences including physics and chemistry.  I consider myself to be an objective observer and am quite familiar with the principles of science and experimentation.  I also am an avid observer of nature, and have been for years.  I live in the country, on an acreage, near Tucson, Arizona. Whatever I saw was remarkable, even if explainable by natural avian behaviors and the orientation of the sun.  However I will tell you that I have seen large hawks soaring at great heights before diving right down to near ground level within feet of me, and with the sun high.  The hawk in that case was a dark speck that quickly grew as it sped toward me, wings tucked.  It didn\u2019t come out of a ball of light. So I\u2019m wondering who else might have reported some similar experience.  A hawk coming out of a ball of light, the light flares and poof there's a hawk.  As I said, I\u2019m not inclined to assume anything supernatural, paranormal, or other-worldly at this time, but I am willing to entertain the possibility.  I\u2019ve encountered UFOs during my flying career and had a friend in the intelligence field who took reports from aircrews who experienced stunning and frightening encounters\u2026 so for me, it\u2019s all on the table.",

      "story": "Three lights with one being green, if connected, one can form a triangle; also stood in place while the lights flashed in a pattern. Friend noticed something odd in the night sky at around 1:50am east of our position. It appeared to be right over Vail, AZ, or our suburb of Rita Ranch.  It was rather odd, when we noticed these three lights, that could form a triangle.  The three lights began to move our direction without breaking formation, and then halted in one spot. It did not move from the position, but instead seemed to blink their lights and stare at us.  I can only assume that they knew of us and watched with caution.  The interesting thing about these lights were that they seem to be blinking in a pattern of sorts, and the left light happened to be the color green, but the other two lights were typical bright star-like lights (although far brighter and clearly closer).  There is no full moon out, nor was it a new moon; the moon was not in my view when looking east toward these lights. The strangest thing was the coyotes were noisy, far nosier than usual.  Typically you may hear a few coyo! tes yipper and howl, but only once in a blue moon (pun intended); this time every coyote was at it.  I thought it may be a party down the wash since it was Fri/Sat, but it was rather late.  Anyways, my friend an I viewed this mystery for a few moments and normally I'm able to point out whether or not it was a plane or helicopter, of course three lights flashing in a strange pattern is a little odd.  The left green light was curious as you never really hear about colored lights unless it pairs with other colors (notably red, because then its a human craft).  The lack of sound didn't help, nor the stationary position it developed.  I wasn't going to wait around any much longer and told my friend to step outside and make sure I enter my house safely (I live across the street in the direction of the mystery), yeah, I was spooked and it was still there when I had entered. I want to point out however that Davis Monthan Air Force Base was to our north and northwest, but what we viewed was directly to the east.  I failed to record the event, at 2am with only the two of us, like hell I'm staying around. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))",

While a passenger in our car heading south in Tucson, Arizona,  I glanced out the window and saw approximately ten large bright round reddish-orange lights flying in formation in the western sky. They formed two parallel but slightly \u201czigzag\u201d rows: the first few lights forming a straight east to west line with the rest of the line continuing slightly farther back; the second row of lights created an identical row behind it, each light being equidistant from the one in front of and beside it.   The first thing I did was lower the car window to rule out reflections on the glass. I could make out no forms nor sound of aircraft and these lights were solid, not blinking as normally seen on aircraft.  They were not individual lights on a larger craft as I could make out faint clouds in the sky behind and between them.  I watched them move Northward across the sky until I couldn't careen my neck any farther out the car window to see them.  They maintained the same formation the entire time, and did not \u201cfade out\u201d as flares would.   I waited to file a report until I had a chance to:  1) drive down the same stretch of road again, at the same time of day, to see if there were any extremely high light poles or radio towers, etc., that could have accounted for the lights and;  2) contact the local Air Force base to confirm whether they had conducted any drills, flare releases, or other such maneuvers that night.  The answer was no on both counts.",

There was no sound coming from the light and the sly was clear, no clouds and an almost full moon.   I would very much like to know what could cause such a light.  I have ruled out stars, airplanes, helicopters, satellites, space station and satellite flares.  Even ruled out a rocket since I don't! believe rocket launches go over Tucson.

      "story": "Bright white orb over Mt Lemmon Tucson AZ Around 6pm, caught site of large bright white (sometimes yellow-gold) orb at top of Mt. Lemmon.  Thought it must be a planet just rising over horizon of mountain, though it seemed too far north for a planet, and the sky was overcast so other stars were hazy but this was super bright and pulsing clearly (like a star on the horizon does). Then saw to right of object, probably several miles to the east along top of mountain, a faint small white light rheostat in slowly, then grow brighter, then rheostat to a deep ruby red, get really bright, then switch off suddenly as if a light switch turned it off.  This happened multiple times in sequence of about 1-3 minutes apart.  Occasional flashes of similar red light on the opposite side of the large white/yellow orb, like a light \u2018echo\u2019, not as \u2018solid\u2019 but there just the same.  The phenomena was persisting so long, I drove up to Sabino Canyon for a closer look but the sky there was dark and couldn\u2019t get as panoramic a view of the range.  Nothing happening there.  Around 8pm when I returned to original location of siting (farther from the range where you can get a broader view of entire top of Mt. Lemmon), there it was again, the bright orb, as if it hadn\u2019t moved (and a planet would have moved in 2 hours)! My memory isn\u2019t precise but for the next 5 minutes or so, what a light show!  The bright white orb blinked out, then suddenly reappeared.  Blinked out then reappeared.  Then moved super-fast to the right about \u00bc inch (viewed from several miles distant).  Then blinked out.   Then reappeared.  There was almost a dance between this larger light and the smaller red lights. A lot of movement, blinking in and out.  It is hard to recall details but all I could think was \u201cthis ain\u2019t no planet\u201d.  There are radio signal towers on Mt Lemon but they pulse and stay turned on all the time, and they are in a different location from where I saw the red lights.  These smaller red lights were shutting off completely, then phasing back in first as white lights, then as ruby red lights. Then blinking off instantaneously.  The last thing I saw was the white orb rheostat to a beautiful golden yellow, 2x or even 3x its original size and then it looked like it split in half and then it simply disappeared, along with the red lights.  Poof.  Gone.  The overriding perception I got was that there was some kind of transdimensional shape shifting happening. I wonder if anybody else saw this in Tucson.  It was mind blowing.",

They show these little micro-movements that remind me of Somebody with a shaky hand holding a laser pointer. This night there were two lights vertically stacked on each other.  They would blink on and off and change color (white to red), and they seemed to be able to move both independently and in unison.  In addition to these lights that I normally see, two nights ago (4/7/18) in the same direction there was what appeared to be a normal aircraft, moving normally, with blinking white lights and a stable red light.

      "story": "I witnessed a large, dark rectangular craft with at least 7 very bright white orb-ish lights hovering low in the sky over Tucson around 11:00 PM on Tuesday, January 22nd. I was driving North toward the Catalina Mountains when I turned my gaze to the left and was startled by an intense set of lights on a large, pitch-black object which appeared to be within 5-6 blocks West of my intersection.  I was startled by how large the object appeared to be compared to usual aircraft, how close it appeared to me, the intensity and unique semi-linear organization of the lights, and by the fact that the craft appeared to be stationary in the sky.  It was lower than a helicopter would typically be, but was larger and flatter than a helicopter. I immediately pulled over with the intent of getting a picture.  Once I was stopped and facing the object straight on, I noticed the rectangular shape and what appeared to be a projection on the far dorsal surface, with some of the lights set further back on the craft than others (in contrast to the semi-linear arrangement of my initial perspective).  Within about 3 seconds of me getting a good look at it from this view, it began a Southeast descent at only about 10mph faster than what I'd expect from a typical aircraft.   At this point I considered that perhaps it was just a helicopter, but I did not hear any sound as it descended and the shape of the object was more bizarre from the sideview, appearing wide across and essentially flat.  One light flashed a couple of times at a quick/strobe-like rate while the others were larger, had a slightly more yellowish hue, and remained constant. I turned my car back around the way I'd initially come, to try and follow it, but by the time I had stopped at a stop sign and turned South, it had gone.  This seemed unusual to me because my view of the horizon was fairly good, and at the speed I had seen it travelling (55 miles at most) I fully expected to still see it after the ~5 seconds it took to get my car reoriented, but I saw no trace whatsoever. No one in surrounding cars seemed to see it, but I did feel uncomfortable with how low and near me it seemed, and I got the impression that it \"responded\" to me pulling over to face it because it had been hovering in the same spot while I was watching it while still driving, but started descending/moving away a very short time after I pulled over.  The only other thing I can think to note is that there had been a power outage 4-5 hours prior in that area, including outage for the traffic lights of the intersection I was at when I saw the object.",

As i glanced to my left looking North at eye level a very bright object very high in the night sky caught my attention upwards. It was headed East away from the city running parrallel to I-10 towards El Paso. The object's entire underside was glowing a very bright bluish green. The shape was part rounded square at back end and almost pickle fork at the front end. It was so high that the glow of the object reflected into the cloud cover which i couldn't in the night sky see except where the objects glow was cast. There was no wings no blinking lights no track lights.  It was traveling extremely fast and after about 4 or 5 seconds it ubruptly turned straight upward and shot into the clouds above disappearing completely. It might be worth noting that a friend that lives in Rita Ranch that i relayed my sighting to immediately says \"The trains by house i have noticed lately run during the middle of the night. Last night at 02:15 i woke up to train after train pulling in and pulling out.  It hws me curious but for some reason i think it has to do with what you saw\" I also felt he might be right that the military is moving live beings or objects in and out of Davis Montham Airforce base in the middle of the night......",

My family and I, along with a 14 year-old neighbor kid were enjoying the evening in the back yard.  We live in Tucson, Arizona.  Our home is located about 2 miles north of the Tucson International Airport (TIA) and the Arizona Air National Guard base.  As I was conversing with my wife, our 10-year-old son said, \u201cWhat kind of plane is that?\u201d  He pointed to the west and I reluctantly looked because it is a constant question they would ask me. Just to shed some light on my background, I am a 23-year military veteran and former 10-year fire fighter, and 12-year law enforcement officer.  I am very familiar with air traffic, types of aircraft, and I also have a bit of surveillance experience on looking for aircraft using binoculars, ground radar, thermal and night vision equipment. So back to my sighting. I told my wife, come look at this!  She also watched in amazement and we could not believe what we were seeing.  This line of lights was very long and did not appear to be an aircraft of any sorts and I could see it still entering the atmosphere.  The object was very long and cruising at a very slow speed.  It was entering from the north and traveling south.  I would say, it was between the planet Saturn and the star Ras Alhague, slightly above them. As I held my hand out and measured It, it was about 5 inches in length as I looked towards the western sky. It was well above the horizon growing brighter. Each light was perfectly spaced apart, but some had distance between the middle lights. The middle lights seemed brighter, especially the one in the center. We were able to watch it for about a minute or so. It was not a meteor shower or a single meteorite. This was moving way to slow, kind of like watching a balloon float across the sky then it just disappeared out of the atmosphere as it neared just above Saturn.  We all tried to take pictures and videos using our Iphones but they could not pick up the image. I have experienced unusual things in my career but nothing ever like this.  I immediately called the Davis Monthan air force base operator and asked to be connected to Air Operations management.  I got no answer and I hung up. I called a supervisor from the U.S. Border Patrol in Three Points, Arizona, to see if any of their guys reported anything over the radio.  Of course, you can imagine I was laughed at! but I know how it is.  These are things you just don\u2019t talk about. I hope this description can give some valuable information on what we saw.",
