It was about the size of a distant full moon and the lights were changing in intensity and size. Sometimes you could see a change in shape as in a fireworks shower. An expansion!  Then it would  go back to it\u2019s original size and the intensity of the lights would dim just a bit.  For a while we were stunned!  But I grabbed the binoculars and got a better look and passed them around the porch. Everyone there saw the same thing.  I ran and got my video camera and started to record. I zoomed it to get the best possible view and proceeded to tape over 25 minutes of footage.  During the time we watched, we saw it morph shape (size and volume) erratic movements never seeming to move far from it\u2019s original position.  The lights,blue,green,red,yellow and white were also changing.",

There were 20 plus blinkers, all seeming far away, except for one that hung very low in the sky and did not blink, but when a picture was taken with a digital camera, it seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern.  To the naked eye, it just looked like a huge white star, just above the treeline.  It's brightness made it suspect, so that is when we got out the camera. The blinkers flashed blue and white and there were some that flashed with a bit of red.  We noticed several other aircraft (small planes and helicopters) constantly intercepting their path.  The blinkers did not move when confronted.  The blinkers did move somewhat, but almost like they were in their own little orbit.  Several zoomed in pictures of the blinkers appeared to be a circular craft with 6 lights and one in the center. Each consecutive picture of one blinker showed a different light on the craft lit up, as if rotating lights.  I am interested to see what happens next, over the past month, there have been more and more blinkers present, and last night was really unbelievable. ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??  PD))",

Sure enough they seen it to. I ran back to the house and got the camera. When I came back outside 4 of our neighbors heard us saying \"Oh my god what is that?\" and came outside. They were right along with us with there cameras taking pictures. Nothing showed up on our cameras. All of a sudden the object started to lower very slowly and all of a sudden vanished.

      "story": "UFO spotted over Toledo, OH, USA. Arc shaped and semi-tranparent. I was standing outside with my mom and fiance.  My mom was in the car already and by the time she got out it was gone.  But my fiance saw it first, she looked up and said \"What\u2019s that?\". I thought she was talking about the big dipper because that's where she was pointing, so I said \"That\u2019s the Big Dipper.\" and she said \"no that\".  Then I saw it looked huge, it was semi-transparent it was arc shape, like  this ( but huge. I couldn't judge well its height very well id say 3000ft up.  It looked like if sat on the ground it would have been several football fields in length at least.  Despite its size it made no sound I could hear, I have good hearing, and so does my fiance.  I'm 20yrs old, and she\u2019s 18. It was quiet outside as well.  It was moving slowly compared to normal aircraft. My mom started the car and the car lights came on, I yelled at her to turn the car off and she did but by the time I turned back around it was gone. My fiance says she thought it kind of flapped slightly like a large slow moving bird mind you she agreed on its size, she said \"If it was a creature it was still the size of several football fields.\" The best way I can explain it is if you took a paper plate, cut out the middle leaving only the curved edges, then cut out a quarter section of the edge giving you a rainbow arc shape, now make it see through, like glass. I could even see the stars through it. I kept looking for it hoping to see it again, but I doubt I will it looked pretty set on its course. I didn\u2019t see it flap and she said it wasn\u2019t very noticeable movement, I think since it was transparent the way it moved in front of the stars did give an appearance of it rippling, I think that might have been what she saw. I hope someone else besides us saw it, it was an amazing sight. Even if it didn\u2019t last long.  As for us, I am a 20 year old Male. I have lived in this city most of my life. I have very good vision, and hearing.  My Fiance is 18 years old, and has also lived here most of her life.  She also has excellent vi! sion and hearing. I'm a normal adult, I spend my time taking care of my dad and hanging out with my friends. My fiance is a senior in High school, and will be graduating this year. We live in a normal city, and I have never seen anything like this as long as I\u2019ve lived here. This is no joke or hoax, if I wanted to make something up id write a book, this was the first site I found to report this so that\u2019s what im doing. Thank you for you time whoever reads this.",

I have never witnessed anything like that before, and I cannot speculate what else it could have been.",

It was a bright light but it was going in circles....not rotating but moving in circles.... Soon another light appeared beside the rotating light and started moving away!!!!!!  I tried to capture with my phone but its no good in the dark....

In the sky above the ridge line was an enormous pulsing light. Red, yellow, blue, orange.... It kept flashing. My husband grabbed the binoculars to see if he could get a better view. He positioned the binoculars on the railing of the porch and took a look.  The lights were rotating around, the object was spinning.  Then a small light began to drip (Like melting wax on a candle) a singular droplet of light started to descend to the tree line. It moved so very slowly.  Slow like 1/10 the speed of a feather falling  When it reached the level of about half the height of the trees trunks height it zoomed to the west.  Still visible the light flickered as it passed between the trees.  Then another began to fall from the ship, as slow and steady as the last. They looked like white glowing orbs.   The size of baseballs to me.  Then the lights shot through the trees in many directions, before returning back to! being beneath the big rotating lights, which had been steadily moving North (the size of 2 basketballs).  This continued until I had visually counted 6, my husband watching along side me. Then just as they had descended, like rewind but very very slowly the lights ascended back to the bright rotating lights. When the last white glowing orb was absorbed the entire thing vanished. This lasted over 20 minutes. We called a friend to see if he could see it or come to watch from our house because the view was so astonishing. We were on the phone with him almost the entire time. Then about 30 minutes later we stepped back out to see if it was back, and we watched what we thought was possibly a satellite move slowly over the house, but just as my husband was explaining why he thought this was a satellite it swerved very quickly and vanished.",

They moved slowly, about the pace you would expect a very high jet to move across the sky.

HD video posted here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPAJJd2XPds   My wife and I were driving north in Washington State on I-5 toward Seattle when we saw a bright indigo light--about as bright as airplane landing lights--ahead of us in the night sky at approximately 9:38pm, Monday, 23 December 2013.  I initially thought it might be a tower light on a hill, but it wasn't blinking, and as we got closer it became apparent that there were no hills; a large, radiant orb hovered high above the freeway against a clear and starry sky.  As I kept driving toward it, the light moved slowly toward the southeast and out of my field of view, though my wife could still see it from the passenger's seat.  She watched it for a minute and then told me to pull the car over (as we passed through Toledo, WA, because the object was getting closer and was definitely anomalous. For the next three minutes, as caught on video, we watched it from the side of I-5, facing northeast, where it silently floated around Jupiter to the left of the Orion constellation, putting on quite a show.  Our limited iPhone cameras did a poor job capturing what we actually witnessed, missing the star-filled backdrop, the nearby farm house, trees, and horizon, and not really capturing how pretty and bright it was, which was significantly brighter than Jupiter and maintained a steady luminosity throughout the duration of the sighting, apart from its slow color changes (mostly blue, violet, and green, with a bit of red and yellow appearing briefly as it shifted colors).  It also seemed to emit two very faint searchlights pointing downward a couple of times, though I couldn't be certain.   After a couple of minutes, it floated down toward the earth and drifted slowly toward the southeast behind some trees, perhaps disappearing into the nearby river valley, or perhaps simply disa! ppearing. I took some still photos, included at the end of the video, though they all look different, suggesting either the limitations of the iPhone 4S camera (such as one photo that looks like blurred movement) or that the object was changing shape as it moved. This is my third UFO sighting since 1995, and my first nighttime sighting. I don't know if it was manmade or not, though I suspect most UFOs are.  All I know is that it seemed big given the apparent height and distance (judging by the tree line that it floated behind), was brighter than most aircraft lights appear at such heights (and certainly more colorful), and made no sound as it slowly and surreally looped about, dancing in the sky.",

      "story": "Objects in sky move at incredible speed. My wife and I were out in my front yard getting some air after watching a movie.  I noticed some odd lights very high in the sky moving as if deciding where to go next.  There was one directly over us and two off in the distance circling one another as if the two of them were watching something on the ground.  You could tell they were moving in circles because of the pattern the lights were following as far as brightness and speeds of movement.  These two circled each other for a while and the other disappeared for a minute.   It then reappeared near the same spot as if the light went out then came back on a minute later. It moved forward, made a ninety degree turn, moved a bit farther then shot off in the direction of the other two at an unbelievable speed.   As it reached the other two it made a half circle around them at speed and moved on in that direction for a good distance.  We lost sight of it and as fast as it left sight it reappeared again behind us crossin! g the sky very very fast. It made no sound and left no trail.  It proceeded towards the other two again at speed and as it approached them it stopped on a dime just outside of the other two.  The two that were circling just sort of stopped and were suddenly gone.  The third again shot off at a speed that just seemed unbelievable to us.  This lasted about 8 \u2013 10 minutes.

The jammed phone is my camera, otherwise I would have photographed them, even though they disappeared after 10 seconds.  Saturday evening on I-75 just south of the I-280 ramp, east of the highway over some industrial buildings or perhaps further away, looking over near the old Jeep Parkway. 20 -30 swirling and darting jet-black spheres slowly rising like a moving swarm.  In the foreground I saw birds of similar relative apparent size that were much closer.  My thoughts went from birds, to balloons, to \"I don't know what they could be besides balloons, it must be a tangle in the wind\".  I called attention to them, and looking back, they were gone.  I thought maybe the! y were obscured by clouds, but the way they moved it didn't make sense already because there was minimal wind at the time.",
