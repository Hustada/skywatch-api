      "story": "What I thought was a helicopter made no noise as it flew over my car. It was late at night and I was driving alone across Kansas on my way to California.  I saw what appeared to be an auto accident on the left side of the two lane highway and off a ways into a farm field.  I didn't stop to help because there was enough activity by the scene.   Maybe ten minutes later I witnessed what I thought was a helicopter coming down the highway towards me, shining a light down onto the roadway.  I thought it was a medivac unit going to evacuate accident victims.   As the low flying craft approached and went over and past my car, it made no noise.   I remember looking into my rear view mirror and saying out loud, \"why didn't that thing make any noise, what the heck is that thing.\"    Interestingly, I forgot about the incident until at least 6 years later. Somehow the memory came back to me during a discussion about ufo's with my son.  It's sort of like remembering a dream and not remembering something that actually took place.",

      "story": "Low flying object with light shining down on road , apparently a helicopter which made no noticeable noise. I was driving across Kansas on my way to California. It was late at night and i had just left a truck stop where i had a cup of coffee. About 100 yards off the road to my left there was what appeared to be an accident where someone had rolled over out in the field. There was what appeared to be emergency vehicles there with what looked like a floodlight on the vehicle.  I didn't stop because there was no need to with what seemed to be emergency vehicles attending. Actually the whole scene seemed surreal. As i continued down the two lane highway, I remember listening to Art Bell on coast to coast radio and there was a show on that was sort of a take off on that 1948 radio show with Orson Welles and \"War of the Worlds\". I remember that on the show, there were alien spacecraft landing around the United States. I remember being momentarily sort of alarmed as i was listening to the broadcast. A couple of minutes later, I noticed a light ahead of me shining down on the road and coming towards me.  I assumed that the light was from a medivac helicopter going to the rollover accident to evacuate injured people. As the light shining down on the road approached and flew over my vehicle I noticed that there was no noise coming from the object which was at a very low altitude (i'd guess no more than 100 ft or so).  I remember how strange it was that a helicopter could be flying that low and make no noticeable noise.  I remember looking in my rear view mirror and saying to myself, what the \"F\" was that thing. Basically,  I forgot about the whole incident until a couple of years ago when I was talking to my son about UFO's while we were having dinner at an Applebee's Restaurant.  Suddenly I just remembered the incident.... as if it was a dream though, and not something that actually took place. He talked to a friend of his who said that I probably had been abducted by a ufo and that they planted the false memories of the accident and the coast to coast show to mask the incident to me. Personally, i don't really know.  The whole thing still seems pretty surreal as if it happened but it didn't happen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "A beam of rotating light in eastern Kansas I don't remember the actual dates. I was working as a conductor on a north/south frieght train in eastern Kansas.  One of our locomotives had suddenly died and I went back to try to restart it.  While looking out the window I saw a bright white beam of light shining down into a farmers field about a hundred yards to the east of our north bound train.  It reminded me of a police helicopter's search light that I'd seen in the city except that it was rotating (spinning).  I couldn't see where the light was coming from because of the window awning on the locomotive so I stepped out on the trailing end of the locomotive to get a better look.  The beam had disappeared and something shot across the night sky like a shooting star.  The whole thing only lasted seconds.  I restarted the engine and it ran perfect the rest of the trip.  The engineer never saw the light and thought I was crazy.",

      "story": "Huge orb at 3:30 afternoon as big and shape of the moon white in color We are traveling north to south on a very windy cloudy day from Nebraska to Dallas coming home.  About 10 minutes before we cross over into Oklahoma, I see a huge ORB that would be the size of the moon at 3:30 in the afternoon.  I have my glasses on, so I can see perfect and for about 11 seconds, I see this ORB like it is going from cloud to cloud not to be seen.  This day we had one layer of clouds and above that another layer and that is where it was located. Huge round all white and a little whiter than the white clouds around it there and perfect round.  Could not see the debth of it just a front view.  I could also see chrystal clear like flares in a few spots on the side two places of the ORB.  Mistic swirling kind of look inside of it. No noise at all. So traveling north to south and the clouds going south to North somewhat and on my right a full sun in the west and the ORB traveling west to east, what a site that was... Size:  you could put about 60 to 75  jets that are that size about 10,000 feet where most chem trails are done.",

I was looking south and spotted 2 red/orange dots in the sky.   I was excited to share with my friend what I was looking at.  I asked him if he would look south at the red/orange dots, and he stated to me the dots are close together and moving towards the North, amount of time watching 1-2 minutes.   We were trying to take picture/video and then suddenly dots disappeared.   I was very excited to share with friends and family, our July 4, 2015, evening.",
