We were on a back road highway and I'm not sure of the name of it, but we realized we were going the wrong way.  I was driving and to our right, over a huge open field high up in the sky, were 9 lights (grouped in 3's) forming a huge triangle. They were slowly rotating as one large object. (The lights were at the corners of the object and were a bright glowing white.)   After one of the 3 groupings \"broke off\" from the formation and started following us.  They were not behind us, though.  They were beside us going at the same speed we were, but keeping a large distance between us.

      "story": "Bright Orange Light from large Black Triangular Vehicle constant altitude, course and speed, no noise. On the evening of July 14, 2019, approximately 9:25 PM EDT,  I was driving home from dinner along Cleves Warsaw Rd, travelling west, glancing out the window to observe the conjunction of the moon with the planet Jupiter occurring that evening in the southwest sky, when I noticed a bright orange light which appeared to be moving slowly from west to east.  What I immediately notices is that this object did not have conventional aircraft navigation lights, tail beacon, or belly strobe light as you would expect to see on a conventional aircraft.  Nor am I aware of any aircraft having an orange headlamp, and having been a student pilot earlier in life, this intrigued me.  I was really trying to see what this object was. \tI continued to drive, until I was able to reach a parking lot, where I pulled in facing south, and I watched the object, travelling at a constant speed, which was relatively slow, my guess would be 30-40 knots, on a steady course towards the east, in the direction of downtown Cincinnati, OH.  The object passed slightly south of where I was parked, about 80 degrees off of vertical at my position, at an approximate altitude, my guess, of 1500 feet Above Ground Level. \tAs the object flew past me, to the east, the orange light flickered out, it didn\u2019t just shut off.  All through its flight, at every angle, the luminosity of the light had been constant.  Once the bright light was gone, I could clearly see a very large black triangular vehicle (perhaps the size equivalent of a Lear jet) continuing its flight to the east, and was able to watch it until it faded into the distance and into the darkening sky (the sun had just set, but there was still quite good light throughout this event). \tThis object made no sound at all.  Its course west to eastward took it perpendicularly through the final approach glideslopes of three major runways of the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky airport.  There was no encounter with an aircraft as it moved through perpendicular to all three runway 18 glideslopes which run north to south. \tI do not know what this was, but a few days later at dinner at a friend\u2019s home, I was told that their son and his friend also saw the same object that same night about the same time from a place that was about a mile east of where I was parked that evening, and that he had called his parents for them to go out and look at it, and his parents missed it.  At dinner that evening on July 18, there was speculation about a drone, sunlight reflecting off an aircraft, and yet to me, that doesn\u2019t explain the lack of engine noise.  I\u2019m wondering if anyone else saw this, and they would know what it was.",

I was 11 years old at the time of this sighting.  The weather was clear and sunny.  I was walking past a large part in an area refered to as \"Queen City\" when something caught my eye and I looked up and saw a very large saucer shaped craft approximately one hundred yards in diamater and about a mile from me and at about fifteen hundred feet altitude.  It appeared to be unpolished stainless steel in color and looked like two saucers turned on top of each other with a row of dark windows separating the two.  I saw no structures above or below it.  It was tilted at a 45% angle toward me and did not appear to be rotating or moving at the time and made no sound at any time.  After a few minutes I realized that it was moving very slowing, almost \"drifting\" southward and over the Ohio River into Northern Kentucky and the Greater Cincinnati Airport.  By the time it got to this point the object was now tilted at a nearly 80% angle.  By this time the light was starting to fade considerable, making contiued visual contact very difficult so I went back to my uncles home.  I did not mention this incident to anyone for many years for fear of ridicule.  During the time of the sighting,I looked around several times thinking that other people would be watching it as well.  I saw no one observing this very large saucer shaped object in broad day light over a large public park in a very large city.  I saw no-one!  I was amazed!!  I thought, \"I cann't believe that no one else is looking at this thing!\"  It was RIGHT THERE big as life and no one else was noticing it.  To this day I don't understand why it seemed that only I could see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

      "story": "Glowing orb floating at treetop level One evening, at about 7 o'clock PM, I was looking out my window over my kitchen sink as I rinsed some dishes.  A glowing, reddish orange orb was floating through the trees in my backyard.  It was about 30 feet from where I stood and just about at my eye level. The orb looked about the size of a giant beach ball. Our yard fell away steeply just feet from the foundation.  I watched this for several seconds as my brain tried to compute what I was seeing.  I watched as it maneuvered through the dense trees, yet never came into contact with one.  It then emerged from the other side of the woods and slowly climbed in altitude until it cleared the hill on the other side of the woods. It then disappeared in the distance.  I listened to the local news reports and scanned the paper for days to see if anyone else had seen it.  This happened in a heavily populated suburb.  One week later, about 10 o'clock PM, I was driving to Blockbuster with my husband and we spotted the same orb near the edge of town.  We followed it until it disappeared into the woods. This happened in the summer of 1992 in Cincinnati, Oh. It has haunted me ever since then. I was 45 at the time and a homemaker. We have witnessed several other strange anomalies in the years since this sighting took place. I know this sounds kooky, but as a child of 6, living in an orphanage in Iowa, I awoke one night to see 3 small alien figures standing next to my bed observing me.

Then he pointed in the sky.  There was an orange sphere of light with a ring around it.  It was relatively large compared to the small stars behind it.  At the southeastern side of the ball and ring there was a blur almost as if an engine was letting out intense heat.  We just stared at it for a while and then went back inside.

I waited and I finally saw them again. I looked closely through my binoculars, and saw a small body.  I got a better view of it, and to big, black eyes were starring at me.

      "story": "UFO sighted on Oct 20, 2007 8:30 pm near downtown Cincinnati One the evening of October 20, 2007, I was driving on Kyles Lane in Ft. Wright Kentucky.   My 15 year old daughter, a passenger in the car, started screaming hysterically that she saw a UFO. I laughed it off, thinking it was lights from a nearby ambulance reflecting off of something.  A quarter mile up the road she screamed again, telling me to look to my left, towards downtown Cincinnati.  This is when I caught my first glimpse of the object.  It was obvious that it was not something normal, but I was seeing it between trees.  As I drove a little bit further up the road it was clear as day to me. The object was lit up bright white with vertical tan marks on it that looked like shadows of some sort.  It was somewhat of a disk shape, with another bubble type disk at the top.  Its size was something I couldn't comprehend the possibility of it being able to hover in the air. It was easily the size of 3 city blocks squared.  I continued on Kyles Lane until I came to the bridge over Interstate 75, where I slowed to a near stop. Here we saw the object was within 2 miles of us, bright as could be, hovering just to the west of downtown Cincinnati.  We were both amazed that none of the other cars seemed to notice it.  At this point I was in total disbelief, on the phone with a friend who lived nearby, telling her to stand in her front yard facing Cincinnati and tell me if she saw it.  She saw nothing. Due to traffic I was forced to continue driving. I changed my course by heading south down Dixie Highway towards Covington and the Ohio River. At this point we saw it again, but this time it was much farther away, I'm guessing 30 to 40 miles north of the city. The shape and brightness of it was so distinct there was no confusion as to that being the same object. I sped down the hill on Dixie Highway towards Covington, trying to get near the river, and a better spot. I was hoping to find someplace to park with a clear view. I lost sight of it again while going down the hill, but once at the bottom, going east to! wards Fi fth Street we saw it for the final time. I was now near the river again, only this time it was east of Cincinnati, about 20 miles from the first sighting. Being a non-believer, I have gone over every possible scenario in my head, trying to convince myself I didn't see what I saw. There is also the fact that my daughter saw it, first I might add, and was completely shaken up to the point of hysterical crying and shaking that I could not console her in the least. I considered taking her to the hospital to be sedated, she was that upset. I also realized that I was shaking while trying to tell the story to a friend where my daughter was spending the night. I spent the rest of the night and the next morning trying to decide whether I was going to tell anyone. I consider anonymously calling the police station and saying \"Look, I don't think I'm crazy, but have you had any reports of a strange bright object seen around the city in the sky?\" I watched every news report for several days and scoured the newspapers, but I have seen no mention of anything that could even remotely be what we saw. There was a blimp in town the next day for a football game, but it was nowhere near the right shape and at least 10 times too small. So help me here, please. Are both my daughter and I certifiable insane or did someone else see this also?",

I would like to report an unusual sighting witnessed by 8 adults on Sunday night September 2, 2007 in Delhi (a western township of Cincinnati, Ohio). It was 9 p.m. and we were sitting on our deck. I noticed 2 blinking, bright star-light objects moving from the western horizon in a straight line toward the east. They were followed by 4 to 6 more similar objects. Then numerous blinking lights appeared traveling or following the lead lights. At one point they appeared to be zigzagging still traveling west to east. The blinking was at about two blinks per second. After they passed 45 degrees overhead they grouped together. Then another group appeared in the western horizon traveling west to east. Meanwhile the first group paused till the second group approached and then they continued on to the west and out of our sight. We estimate from 80 to 100 of the blinking white lights. The event lasted 2 to 4 minutes. We are professional, respected adults who live and work in our community. I am a grade school teacher. I have taught 5th grade astronomy. I am familiar with the night sky. This was very unusual. I would appreciate some information or feedback concerning the event. Thank you.",

      "story": "Dark object falling rapidly downward from the sky with bright orange flames emanating from it On Monday, February 11, 2008, I was driving home. I was going down Interstate 71 south, and then turned on to Ronald Regan Highway, traveling Westbound. Less than one minute later, at almost exactly 2:01 a.m. I saw an object falling from the sky. It was nearly straight ahead of me and a little to the left, so I would estimate it was in the West-Southwest direction of the sky from where I was located. The object was falling very rapidly so I only saw it for about 3 or 4 seconds. It was falling at an angle from right to left, at about 7 to 8 o\u2019clock (as if looking at a clock handle). There were bright orange flames coming off the object. The object itself was really just a dark spot, but it looked like a dark oval (judging from the flames coming off of the sides essentially); I could only see the flames coming off of it. What really surprised me is how bight and orange the flames were. I have seen meteor showers before, and this looked nothing like a meteorite that I had seen before. The size was very large, and it looked like something was on fire and just falling out of the sky. I did not see if it made it to the horizon, as there were trees to the side of the highway. I sped up in my car trying to make it past the trees on the left to the next clear spot where I could see closer to the horizon, but that took about ten seconds and by that time the object had disappeared.",

But something was wrong becasue there were two (kind of overlapping each other), but one of the sets were moving at a exceptional speed.  The set of the seven stars in the form of the big dipper were going south by south west.   Later the rest of my family came out and witnessed it to.   As we looked closer I also noticed that a few of them had little red light probes going around it (though very hard to see).   Some may say that stars don't move becasue of clouds or something, but we measured the distance with our roofline and other stars.  Other starts weren't moving, just that \"big dipper.\"  Eventually after 30-60 min it disappeard.  It appears that the object was mimicking stars to get around \"undetected.\"",

It kept swaying back and forth in an upward motion.  At first it was hovering over the same spot but then it continued to get higher. This went on for about two to three minutes and it disappeared. We actually could not believe what we were seeing. I typically do not believe in this type of stuff but there is NO other explanantion for this object. The fact that it was dark outside and we could see this black object floating in the air, leeds me to believe that this was something of a different nature. I do not know if this was indeed a UFO, but it was not normal whatever it was.  Please, I am not crazy. There were 3 of us, completely sober, who all witness the same exact object and motions. I did try to take a picture of the object. Only if you hold the carmera a certain way can you see the \"glow\" of the object.  It was a white circle around it. My flash on the camera would not work so I guess the black object did not come through. I just really want some type of explaination as to what this was?

As CKY is just across the Ohio River and a major flight path goes over my neighborhood I assumed it was a mid air explosion of a commercial aircraft. As I drove towards where the objects seemed to be descending I saw there were actually four burning fire balls moving in formation. These were not burners, they were visibly flaming and left 'tails' as they moved. It was an irregular motion and I watched them until they moved out of view. There was a lot of other aircraft activity in the sky as well, including a low flying(and fast) military aircraft that was discernably terrestrial and several civilian aircraft mentioned above that flew much higher and served as a point of reference for both fireballs and military plan. I ca! n still hear aircraft flying overhead in my apartment as a write. Amazing. I also got a poor picture on my camera phone though it does reveal the 4 orbs.",

On 2/11/09, there were storms with high straight line winds, up to 65 mph in some places, in the Cincinnati area.  As the storms were moving out of my local area, I noticed some mammatous clouds, and went out to the entrance to our garage at about 5:45 pm,  to take some photos of them.  The garage faces a little south of due west.  I was using a Nikon D80 with a zoom lens, Nikon model DX AFS Nikkor 18-135 mm 1:3.5-5.6G ED, with no filters.  The clouds were coming straight towards the open garage, and there was a very light rain falling, so I was standing slightly inside the garage to minimize water drops on my lens.  After taking some photos to the west, I stepped out of the garage and looked back to the east, where there was a faint rainbow, which I also photographed, along with some tall clouds to the south. I noticed nothing unusual during the photo shoot, but when I went inside, downloaded the pictures to my computer and looked at them full-screen, the cylindrical object was evident in a picture taken facing due west.  At first, I thought the object had been blown into the air by the strong winds, and only made jokes about its possibly being a UFO.  I didn't remember ever having seen images of cylindrical UFOs.  But after about a week, I got curious, and found numerous web sites with images of cylindrical UFOs, which is what I now believe the object in the photos was. There was a second photo that showed probably the same object, less clearly.  It was taken from the same position as the first, but facing southwest.  The second photo was taken less than 2 minutes, but longer than 5 seconds after the first.  The first photo was taken at 1/180 of a second, the second at 1/100 of a second.  In the second image, the object appeared to be somewhat larger, but the lens was zoomed in slightly compared to the first. I am not aware of any other potential observers of this object.  I saw no objects first hand, only after displaying the photos on my computer. I am a 65 year old, retired PhD physicist, having worked as a research physicist for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health from 1975 to 2003, and then as a US government contractor until 2006.  I am active in community instrumental music groups and in amateur photography.  I have never before seen a UFO, to my knowledge, certainly not an unlighted cylindrical one.",

I was driving on Hershel Avenue in Hyde Park when I looked up and saw three orange and red objects that were round in the sky.  I said to my female friend \u201cwhat is that.\u201d   A few seconds later another one went by and another one followed closely behind.  My female friend said \u201cstop the car I want to get out.\u201d  With that I looked to see if there was a car behind us but nobody was on the road.  She got out and I also got out looking in the general direction of the objects.  There was no sound as they flew by.   They appeared to be 50 or 80 thousand feet in the sky and flying a low speed.  The sky  was clear and there was a moon with no wind.   The objects were moving from the east to the west.  We got back in the car and drove west.  In the distance we could still see the objects forming a circle and following each other in sequence.  They continue to glow a orange/red color and were spinning yet not moving very fast.  As we headed down Erie Avenue towards Hyde Park Square we could still see the objects then they vanished. When I got back to my female friend apartment we got out of the car and went down to the street level.  I looked to the east and saw one more object coming our way.  The object was smaller than the rest but had a red and orange glow.  There was no sound as it flew overhead at a slow speed.  Then a second later after it passed it vanished. We went into her apartment and called Lunken Airport but they didn\u2019t see anything or heard of any reports.  Then we called local news stations, District Two Police and the Cincinnati Enquirer.  All the news agencies said they never heard of anyone else seeing anything. I called the UFO Center to report my sighting and Mr. Peter Davenport answered the phone.  He told me to write down what we saw and we both needed to file a separate report to this agency.  Then Mr. Davenport said see if there is anything on the news about your sighting or if anyone else saw it.  The next day I looked in the papers, and looked at all the local news and there were no reports. In Hyde Park there is an observatory not far from where we first spotted the objects.  I fired an email to the head person there and they respond saying they had guests in the observatory that night but were looking in the direction of the moon.   The gentleman said that there may have been a meteor shower going on at the time or what we saw may have been space junk.  I have seen a meteor shower before, but the meteor past very fast overhead.   I never seen anything that was red and orange that looked like a ball of light flying a low speed.   It was very weird. So far nobody has seen anything to my knowledge or nobody is saying anything.  We live about 60 miles south of Wright Patterson Air Force Base,  10 miles from Greater Cincinnati Airport and 5 miles from Lunken Airport.  We could not hear any sound from these objects so therefore they were not aircraft related.    We both saw them and I must say it was very interesting.",

      "story": "My wife and I pulled onto shoulder of highway to observing a hovering sphere of light for 2 minutes!  See long description. My wife and I (son was sleeping in car seat) were driving on I-275 South(east) towards Milford, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. As I was driving south I looked up in the sky and a couple of miles ahead of me I saw a glowing orange sphere. I knew it was not a meteorite because I was driving for a good minute before I drove underneath it (and it was still hovering). I kept yelling to my wife in the back with the baby to look up and see it. She could not see it from her angle. I did not want to be the only person who saw this because the veracity of a sole witness is always a challenge. As we drove underneath the object I made the decision to turn on my hazards and hop on the shoulder. I have never pulled over for something like this before, as I have always been able to identify an object, until now. As I was slowing down I kept trying to look up and I almost hit the guardrail as I was pulling over. My wife yelled me to watch out. This did not make her happy since it was her car. As I stopped the car I opened the sunroof and said look! There it was just hovering above us. An orange glowing sphere. The time was 9:39pmEST. It was difficult to determine its altitude and relative size. She thinks it was \u201ctoo high for a helicopter\u201d, but I think it was only about 5000'-10,000\u2019. It was the size of a (small) dime. Of course you need to know the altitude to determine its actual size. It did not have any other colored lights on it. Just an orange glowing \"sphere\". I should caution in calling it a sphere as we were unable to determine if it was disc/egg shaped due to the glowing light. Sphere matches the best visual description. The light did change in intensity but it was a very small fluctuation and could have been our eyes playing tricks on us. My wife and I were going through a detailed Q&A trying to discern what it was. It was not moving, on any plane (X,Y, or Z). There were no conventional Nav lights or beacons, there was no noise except for the highway, and my wife complaining to get us out of t! here bec ause I woke my son up and they did not share the same enthusiasm and excitement. I did not want to leave because I wanted to wait and see it move. I wanted to see its propulsion. Was it conventional or something unexplainable by our current understanding of technology? This would have filled in a great piece of the puzzle and possibly answered the question. Very frustrated, I decided to heed the wife\u2019s advice and get off the shoulder because we were not in a safe place on the road with traffic whizzing by us.  After safely merging back on I-275, I immediately called my mother's house to tell them to run out front and look to the north a few miles and up (they are on the highest development around and would have a perfect view). My stepfather answered my call and ran to the front to take a look. He saw nothing. We reached exit 59 within a minute (Milford Parkway) and looked to our right (north). You could see a great amount of the horizon and we saw nothing. We arrived home about 5 minutes later, then I made calls to friends and family and now I\u2019m typing this report.  The credibility of the witnesses (my wife and I) are impeccable, as well as the intelligence and scientific backgrounds to make an unbiased observation. We are also well known and respected in the community. In addition I am an amateur astronomer and private pilot (not current) with exceptional knowledge of ALL active military aircraft in service (except of course current black projects). If it warrants an investigation, you have all of my contact information and can Google and contact me. Thank you.",

At that point the fireworks look like a battlefield of muskets going off nothing but grey clouds of smoke. I recorded the show on my dvr.   At about 9:21-25p.m. easter time a bright white light shows up on the right side of the screen and moves all the way to the left side while these fireworks are going on.  When we put it in slow motion it looked like we could make out the shape of the object which looked like more of an egg shape on the left side compared to the saucer looking shape when it first came into view.  It moved too fast to be an airplane and I can say that with confidence because Airplanes are not supposed to fly that close to the bridge and also as soon as the show is over you can see an airplane fly through the back with a c! onstant flashing light compared to the constant brightness of the ufo. I would say if we had a 1080 p tv we could get a better view due to the larger pixels of our tv",

      "story": "Four reddish-orange lights traveling slowly across the sky in Cincinnati, OH On Halloween evening, my daughter, my neighbor and I were standing at the end of my driveway handing out candy to trick-or-treater\u2019s. As we were facing north, all three of us observed a line of 4 reddish-orange circular lights emerging slowly from behind the trees to the north. I saw what appeared to be a 5th reddish-orange light trailing the other four at a somewhat greater distance, but when the group of 4 emerged into our line of sight I no longer saw the 5th light. The 4 lights traveled as if they were attached by a string, that is, the distance between them did not vary at all as they moved. Perhaps this indicates that they were attached to a craft of some sort, but none was visible from where we stood.. The lights traveled very slowly, from right to left, across our line of sight in a westward direction. As they moved far to the left they dimmed and flickered out, one by one, until they all disappeared. I tried to take note of whether they passed behind a cloud; I don\u2019t think that was the case. Relative to the diameter of a full moon, the length of the formation appeared to be about 6 times that diameter. The angle above the horizon was approximately 55-60 degrees as best I can determine. Each of these \u201corbs\u201d was about 4 times larger than the brightest star I\u2019ve ever seen. None of us heard any sound from this craft, if that\u2019s what it was, but given the distance from us, one wouldn\u2019t likely hear any sound. My neighbor dismissed this whole thing, saying they were \u201cballoons\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019ve been thinking about this and decided it\u2019s definitely out of the ordinary, so decided to report it. My daughter agrees.",

There was no sound coming from these objects which really got us wondering what these were. The objects stopped moving completely for about 5 to 10 seconds then they both started moving slowly upward and we watched them disappear into the clouds.

It was about 935pm.  There were scattered fireworks going off to the south and the northeast but I think it was still a little too light out for people to start setting things off in earnest.  The sky was clear or had a few clouds.  I was looking at and scanning the tree line with binoculars for perched owls when I saw this persistent orange-yellow light in the sky south or southwest hovering in the same spot at maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon and not flickering.  The light was maybe 2 or 3 times larger than Venus in the sky and certainly way smaller than the moon.  I had no idea what it was but eventually figured it was either a) some kind of firework b) the back of a distant plane/jet or maybe c)the launch of some kind of rocket or something since the last weird thing I saw in the sky, that was kind of similar to this event, was part of an NSA Atlas rocket launch. After a few minutes of shining in exactly the same spot in the sky, the light stopped and I saw this gray, blurry object slowly arc a very short distance east from where the light had been until it faded away or I just lost track of it in the increasing darkness.  The gray object, which I figured was the emitter of the light, was roughly the same size as the light or maybe slightly smaller and possibly top-like in shape.  I watched the whole sequence with and without binoculars but don't recall the binoculars giving me a much better view of the event except that they more clearly revealed a non-flickering light.  The light was shining for a few minutes and I saw the gray object for probably less than 30 seconds. I don't know what it actually was but still think it could have been one of the things I thought it might be.  If it was a firework, I've never seen anything exactly like it before.  The light looked sort of like a Roman candle if there was just one flare, no smoke trail and the flare stayed in one spot in the sky instead of moving in an arc.  If it was a plane, there should have been blinking lights on the object after the light, it should have moved in a more direct way and I should have heard some sort of sound.  I don't recall hearing any sounds that I could attribute to the light/object.  And if it was some sort of rocket, it didn't seem to leave Earth's atmosphere and was a little different than what I saw before. I had actually completely forgotten about this until Peter Davenport appeared on Coast to Coast AM and am submitting this report per his request.  And I'm not looking at any of the other reports until I submit mine.",

      "story": "Triangular UFO seen in daylight, with U.S. jet chasing My husband and I were traveling to my parents' house one afternoon when I saw this very large, triangular shaped aircraft traveling above us. It wasn't going very fast, and it was close enough to the earth to see detail. It reminded me of an arrowhead in shape; it had three points, a light orange light on each point, and the back end of the craft bowed inward between the two end points.  I rolled down my window but could not detect a noise.  The craft had no noticeable markings and seemed to be made of metal, which was a medium gray. It was not shiny; the outside of the craft had a dull finish to it. Both my husband and I watched it as it continued straight, then made a ninety-degree sudden turn to the left. It suddenly started flying off toward the distance at a much faster pace than it had been going, and it was soon out of sight. My husband and I were talking about what we'd seen when a U.S. Plane that looked like a jet came from the direction that the other aircraft had come from. This plane was loud, fast, and a dark gray to black in color. Where the UFO had made a ninety-degree turn, the new plane turned as well, although it didn't turn as sharply or as quickly as the other craft had. It followed the trail that the other aircraft had made, zooming out of sight in the same direction. I wouldn't be surprised if someone else saw this craft in action that day. It was about two in the afternoon in the middle of summer, and the route the air crafts took was along the same route of a popular road in our hometown. This craft was very large and like nothing I had ever seen before, so it was bound to gather attention. I did not hear anything about this craft from anyone else whether through word-of-mouth or media afterwards, although I did look out for more information.

It disappeared after about two minutes, so I disregarded it as a possible helicopter or airplane. The light suddenly came back slightly to the right of where it was moving before.

I was lying in bed next to my girlfriend and next to an east facing window at roughly 11:10pm EST 01/22/12, Downtown Cincinnati when I saw a flash of light from the left corner of my eyes.  I turned my head, looking southeast out the window and noticed a round orange/red globe/orb-like object floating along without sound traveling northwest toward my condo.  My girlfriend and I were astonished by its ability to drift, sometimes moving up or down unlike that of a helicopter or private jet! The object was coasting at a pretty good clip.  At this point I climbed higher into the window to get a better less inhibited view through the glass as opposed to through glass and outer screen. At that moment we noticed another object just like the first following a short distance behind approx \u00bd mi. Then came another and another.  Those that followed totaling 5 or 6 more were performing maneuvers unlike the first three and more peculiar.  My girlfriend again pointed out two more circling each other to our southeast while those behind them were hovering very close to the tops of the city skyscrapers around the corner of Seventh and Vine and then finally nearing the ground hovering straight down at roughly Race and 9th St. Downtown Cincinnati.  The one that initially appeared to land on a building top came slowly down at that junction and out of sight once again. I proceeded to film those closest to the downtown buildings rather than following those who were in a straight path out of sight north and west of my home.  The angle from my vantage point to the objects\u2019 was somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees from the ground.  They were straight up halfway across the 8 or 9 Cincinnati City Blocks from east to west on a map. The remaining 2 objects exploring the downtown building tops eventually in just under a minute began to make their way due north up the I71 corridor and out of site.  The objects\u2019 diameter appeared to be a car\u2019s length maybe slightly longer.  I estimated by the size of the object that appeared to land on the building in relation to the size of the rooftop.  We were not sure what to do exactly however with a little research we found the NUFORC.  We have 2:44secs of footage taken from my Droid Camcorder to accompany this report.",

      "story": "Pitch black UFOs with red-pink light that faded This report summarizes the sighting of at least 3 unidentified flying objects on the east side of Cincinnati in Anderson Township.  This happened on the evening of July 4, 2011, around 10 pm (time is approximate.  I did not check the exact time when the sightings occurred).  All three sightings occurred when there were fireworks going off in the sky, and later when the fireworks ceased, we had no more sightings. The first sighting happened at approximately 10 pm (plus or minus 15 minutes).  My son and his friends noticed a red/pinkish light in the distance to the southwest.  It grew larger as it got closer and then they said the light just went out.  That\u2019s when I looked over to see what they were talking about.   At that time, I could see the object, but it was pitch black.  There were no lights on it at all, which ruled out commercial aircraft immediately.  Also, the shape of it was irregular.   From my angle, it looked to be somewhat triangle shaped, with the nose slightly rounded, but the \u201ctail\u201d was not straight as a triangle would be.  The tail was rounded, or bulged out.  It was almost heart-shaped, with the point being the nose.  If flew due north at this point and my wife then saw it as well.   After the red/pink light(s) when out, there were no more lights that appeared on it.  It flew into the distance and we lost sight of it.   The entire sighting lasted maybe a minute. The second sighting happened about 5 minutes later, around 10:05 pm.  This time I saw the red/pinkish light in the southwest.  It immediately got my attention since it was not blinking at all.  We watched as it came closer (heading approximately northwest) and before it got over our location, it turned east.   At that point the light began to diminish/fade out.  I watched it as the light faded out and at that point it was behind a tree in the neighbor\u2019s yard so I could not get a good view of it.   I went to the other side of the tree to watch it as it headed east (I assumed it would be the black mass like I saw before) and I did not see it emerge from behind the tree.  I searched the sky but could not find it.  Again, the entire sighting lasted maybe a minute or more. The third sighting happened about 10 minutes later and this time it was again the red/pink light in the southwest.  I wanted to get a good look at this one and take a video with my phone.  I turned to tell me son that another one was heading our way, and as I turned back to look at it, it was gone. Being the 4th of July, it\u2019s very easy for people to dismiss this as fireworks, but I can assure you that this was definitely NOT fireworks.  The black mass that flew north (the first sighting) moved about the same speed as the commercial jets that cross the sky in my area (there is an airport near, and we did see other aircraft that night).  But I have never seen an aircraft that just had one red/pink light (instead of the red/green that is required), that did NOT blink at all (commercial craft lights blink).   Also, the light faded out; it didn\u2019t turn off as in a switch.  It was gradual.  Plus the shape of the craft was NOT anything that I\u2019ve ever seen.  Even if some would say that it was a commercial craft that had it\u2019s lights off for some reason, the shape of the craft was not like any aircraft I have ever seen. There may have been one or two more sightings by my son and his friends before the initial sighting in this report, but it wasn\u2019t until I saw the craft as described above that turned completely black that I started documenting the sightings.",

In October of 1993 I was walking from the Library Building towards Rhine Hall on the campus of Cincinnati Bible College and as I looked up and towards my left (which meant I was looking towards the Ohio River and the Northern KY area)  I saw a UFO.   I saw what appeared to be the seven colors of the spectrum emerge from nowhere and briefly move across the sky southwestward in a pattern that I can only liken to a chalkboard line maker moving across a chalkboard.  If you were in grade school in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s as I was you may remember your teacher placing chalk in several wire holders attached to a piece of wood she would use to make lines on a chalkboard.  Imagine the colors of the spectrum being drawn on a chalkboard and that is basically what I saw. The colored lines emerged from nowhere and briefly moved across the sky and then abruptly stopped.   From them shot a bright white light that moved across the sky in a southwestwardly direction.  The whole sighting took a couple of seconds at the most.

The object was reddish orange in color, twice the size of Venus, but about the same brightness as Venus. I instantly called the wife and two kids out to see the object.  It did shimmer a bit, so my wife instantly said it looked similar to a Chinese lantern.  I disagreed; the object moved too fast and steady for it to be in any wind pattern.  It took the object approximately 10-12 seconds to move from horizon to horizon, traveling silently from south to north in a straight line. I\u2019ve observed the ISS in the past, and this object was much bigger and seemed a lot lower in the atmosphere.  I\u2019ve also considered that it may have been a meteorite; it certainly moved like one, but the red color seemed all wrong.  We did have some severe weather move through the area a couple of hours later, so maybe the atmospheric conditions gave it the red color. I can say that its brightness stayed consistent, so I don\u2019t think it was reflecting sunlight; tt appeared to be self luminous.  While I\u2019m sure it was natural in origin, there was just something very odd about its appearance.

I put on a doubler and my 200 MM telephoto lens.  I took 7 photos of the object which had no movement other than the rotation of the earth taking it downward out of the cameras field of view.

I took a picture of it that's when i noticed that the second object was round i then downloaded the picture to my pc and cropped it to get a closer look. I was amazed at what it really was it had green lights coming from it and it's round in shape. That object was in the sky for at least 2days and last night when we looked up in the sky it was gone.

      "story": "Glowing Orange Fireball / Lights Seen at Turpin HS Football Game. This sighting occurred while at the Turpin High School vs Anderson High School football game at Turpin, Anderson Township / Cincinnati, Ohio.  I was happy to discover that another group of eyewitnesses from the Cincinnati area submitted a video account of this occurrence on the NUFORC site. At some time around 8PM, sitting in the stands at Turpin's football field, facing west, I noticed what appeared as one bright single orange light/ball of fire, that seemed to hang in the sky for a few minutes before breaking into two, then three glowing orange balls of light.  People around me were witnessing it as well.  A few kids were pointing and laughing say, \"Ohhh, look at the UFOs.\"  I was amazed as these balls of light would slowly drop downward, and at first I wondered if they were some kind of night time military exercise, or maybe skydivers, or luminary sky lanterns. The lights appeared to me to be nearby Lunken Airport (which is due west from Turpin, about 4 miles away), which led me to believe it was possibly a night time parachute jump with the parachutists wearing flares.  But I ruled that out as these glowing balls of fire seemed to hang in the sky far too long to be parachutes.  So I wondered if maybe they were hot air balloons, as they would float downward, but them rise back up in the sky.  But I counted that out as the glowing lights would fade in and out of view--and this was on a perfectly clear night.  They appeared to be maybe 2-3 miles in distance from us. As I was about to conclude they were parachutists on a night jump, suddenly they moved upward at least a thousand feet and orbited around each other a bit, then appeared to be floating in a triangle shape, then appeared to go back into one ball of fire.  Very strange.  At one point when they first broke off from one ball of light to two, it appeared that two of them were linked by a long shaft of light...honestly it appeared to me by the color of it that they were connected by a rope of fire. If you watch the video:    [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4ouLci9bNN_dzJIY2NPQnlSLVE/edit?usp=drive_web]  just after the two minute mark, a streak of light appearing much like a shooting star, shoots off to the right from these balls of light (watch from the lower part of your screen.  I witnessed this as well. I was pretty freaked out, and had pointed it out to a few of my family members after watching it for a good 3-5 minutes, saying, \"Please tell me what we are looking at?\"  Finally they faded into darkness--just totally disappeared.  Naturally, I would glance around the sky from time to time the rest of the night, wondering what we had just witnessed. After they faded out of view, one lady nearby was quite unnerved and started exclaiming, \"Did anyone just see that??\"  A lot of people did, but I thought it was odd that most everyone just glanced at it, then shrugged it off and kept watching the game, which by the way was boring and untypically quiet for a Friday night football game.  The reason I bring this up, I was listening for aircraft engines, but it was very quiet. This is where it gets weirder.  By this time, it was half time, and naturally, I was glancing around in the night sky to see if there was going to be any more of this phenomena.  I turned around and behind me, facing an easterly direction, appears a ball of light, in what I estimate to be 1,500 - 2,000 feet in the air.  It's bright, moving slowly toward me, and so I'm wondering if my mind is playing tricks on me and if I'm just being paranoid.  So I rationalized, surely it's a plane in a landing pattern heading towards CVG airport.  However, it looked like an orange ball of light, not a landing light.  Also, I was looking for the flashing wing tip lights as it appeared to be getting closer.  Never saw them. A man I had never seen before was standing directly behind me.  I asked him, \"Do you see what I'm seeing?  Is that an aircraft, or what the heck is that light behind us?\"   This guy NEVER looked back behind us to see what I was pointing at but instead looked me dead in the eye and said, \"You're not supposed to see that.\"  WHAT THE FREAK!!  I said to him, \"Do you even know what I'm talking about?\"  So he casually glanced back and said something like, \"Yeah, have you ever heard of Area 51?  You're not supposed to see this.  Just pretend it never happened.\"  Now, THAT was weird.  VERY. WEIRD. I grabbed my wife, who was busy chatting away with someone, wanting someone to tell me I wasn't crazy and said, \"LOOK!  Tell me what you see.  Is that an airplane?\"   Suddenly the orange ball of light which was slowly moving toward us seemed to break off into TWO BALLS of glowing orange light.  It was as if the second ball of orange light came out from behind the first ball.  But they were heading right towards us, at this point it seemed less than 1/2 mile away.  I wondered if they were going to pass right over us hoping I could get a good look at what they were, but suddenly they faded out.  It was as if a passing cloud blocked them out, but then they were gone. Were they planes in a landing pattern line up, or was this the same lights we saw some 30 minutes before?  The mystery guy?  I never had seen him before, and I never saw him after I pointed it out to my wife.  He may have simply been a dad of one of the students attending the game but his response was very strange. And where did he go?  I think it was interesting to observe how most everyone just chose to ignore these strange lights as something they just didn't recognize and went about business as usual, watching the game.  Only the two kids initially pointing, laughing and acting silly and scared about seeing UFOs, and then the one lady who was vocal about what she had witnessed, besides myself asking her what she thought they were.  Everyone else just shrugged, and I think were afraid to admit they had just seen something they couldn't explain. This morning while surfing the web, I came upon this site and looked up the date of the game, wondering if anyone had reported the sighting.  I was glad to find a confirming video of it.",

I do this several times during the evening every night weather it's clear out or not.  I have these Binoculars that can see star's that the naked eye can't see with out them. I had just got done scanning the Western sky's when an airliner coming out of the South heading East caught my eye.  I followed the plane for a few seconds (now I'm facing east) and I bent my head back while turning to the West and this huge bright light caught me, really by surprise.  It just wasn't there a few seconds ago. I live next to an airport and have flown myself a few times, so when I say that it was about 15,000 ft. that's a pretty good guess.  So any way I latch on to this light with these binoculars and I'm watching it fly over my head for about a minute and all of a sudden the light goes out but I can still see the damn thing.  I'm watching this for a good 30 seconds when it just cloaked out on me.  That's right, it just disappeared on me.  I saw what looked like heat waves first and it slowly just disappeared.  And it didn't make a sound. I got a really good look at this ship, it was teardrop shape with2 the small end going forward. It looked to be black and gray in color with oval shape windows on the sides.  It looked like a large light with some sort of markings the on the bottom.  I am in the process of making a mechanical drawing of the ship.

I had walked up to the top of my street (which is approximately a 32\u00b0 angle uphill), and turned the corner walking to the right and past the first house on the right.  My dog then stopped to use the bathroom in the grass, while I stood there looking north, staring off into the dark between the large clearing of two houses.  (This would be looking in the direction as if I were at the top of my street looking down).  I saw what looked at first to be just airplane lights, red and blue, out of the corner of my eye.  Didn't think much, until I realized these lights were moving usually fast.  So I turned my attention directly on them, and within a few seconds, saw the lights stop and hover, and then all of a sudden they made a complete \"sideways U-turn\" and started headed east.  I literally said out loud, \"What ((deleted)) is that??!!\" (talking to my dog).  Just as quickly, the lights swerved back to the left (west), and flew for just a second until it stopped and hovered again! I proceeded to get my phone camera out to videotape, and as soon as I pulled the video application up, the red light in the sky went out, leaving just this fluorescent blue light, which suddenly dropped straight down, quick as lightning! Like it just fell from the sky.  I focused my camera on where I thought the light had dropped, and caught it on camera shooting straight back up..  it then dropped down once more, which I saw with my eyes, but did NOT catch on camera (even though my camera was focused right on it) and between messing with my phone, I did not see the light come back up.  About a minute later I saw both red and blue lights in the sky again, seeming to fly north until they just disappeared suddenly.  It was the strangest, scariest, yet most exciting experience I've ever seen\u2026  I didn't even think it was real.  I asked my dog, \"Did that really just happen!?\"  It happened so quick, I literally almost doubted myself.  But there is no doubt about what I saw.  There was definitely SOMETHING there, and it was NOT NORMAL, and NOT an optical illusion...  I cannot explain it to be anything other than a UFO.",

Stayed nearly in the same place (so not a satellite).  Wiggled around a bit.  No beams of light coming from it or going to it.  Occasionally a short streak of light came from it as it appeared to go higher?   Got dimmer and eventually our view was obstructed by cloud cover. Three witnesses, never before reported a UFO sighting... never witnessed one before.   All 3 witnesses were free of any drugs/alcohol.  I have taken astronomy courses before.",

Any way i was looking up in the same area as the last time and noticed a orange ball just bouncing up and down then vanished.  Since the 7/1/12 whenever i go outside i pay attention snd yet a feeling that i get nervouse over what i will see.   Then a third sighting apx. 6/30 i was outside but sitting on my front rs porch and i saw two orange glowing lights again.  They seemed to be headed in the direction of my house side by side moving in a straight direction.  Then changed direction moving south instead of west towards me.  They stayed side by side then just vanished.  I called mufon and made a report here two years ago.  A person from my area was supposed to come over to my hom because of the major sighting and  investigate it due to 3 of us had such a bazzar encounter two years ago and it was hovering over my house for several minutes actually 15 to 20 minutes but he never bothered to come and interview me.  So this time i am not bothering with mufon and reporting it here instead. That upset me. Especially since the home base for mufon is here in the Cincinnati area.  I just know now when i go outside i always look up and yet get afraid of what i will see due to such a close encounter i had two years ago on the same date.  That ufo was about 150 to 200 ft over my house and i think or feel like it knew we were paying attention to it. That was a green round disk plus orbs. Moved very slow and hovered right over us.",

Last evening, April 26th, from 21:30-21:55 a group of 20 gathered at a home in Greenhills, Ohio, witnessed 14 orange/red lights move one after another across the sky each to eventually blink out.  It was very unusual making no sound. All of them came from the northeast and moved to the south/southwest (the opposite direction of our current weather pattern.  Additionally, they would have been moving too fast to be floating.  They were more the speed of a fast aircraft on a calm evening. We had plenty of time due to the number that kept coming to record videos and take a few photos.  Additionally, we were able to observe through binoculars.  I\u2019ve spent considerable time through my life star gazing and have never seen anything like this. I did call 911 to report. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, Below is an updated version of my submission including the weather report verifying the direction of wind I reported.  I've also uploaded two videos to Youtube with the following links.  Let me know if I can enhance the report.  I will try to get two other witnesses to report as well.  Do you want them included in this or filed separately? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsYN9vdb0Gw&feature=youtube_gdata_player https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66j4DPRYjCU&feature=youtube_gdata_player Here are two videos I took of the lights we observed over Greenhills Saturday night.",

      "story": "14 Red/White Spheres Flying Silently over Cincinnati, OH, with video recording. On the evening of April 26th, 2014 three families were gathered socializing with our kids.  A friend of my 12 year old came to the door and asked that we go outside so she would know she was not crazy.  We then observed what she had been witnessing for the previous 10 minutes or so.  From the horizon north of us heading south/southwest a bright light red/orange/white (changing) would move silently across the sky directly above us and then somewhere between 90-120 degrees across would blink out and disappear.  As one was overhead, the next would come from the horizon.  The 13 year old girl did say that she witnessed two come at once with one blinking out before the other.  The rest of us saw one at a time.  There were 20 of us in the yard the witnessed the last 4.  I was able to video record with my Droid Razor Maxx three of them.  Links to the YouTube posting are provided.  Keep in mind that in the recordings I opted to stay zoomed in at all times other than! the beginning of one that shows one initially coming over the horizon starting spot over our house before I zoomed. Because I was zoomed in you it shakes (remember the flight path was direct and smooth) and you cannot see how quickly they came one at a time across the sky. I hoped by staying zoomed in there might be a moment something of importance might be caught.  My phone was zoomed in at 4x. Just as the last one was gone, I called 911 to report.  They had no knowledge of the event and did not call me back.  I called Wright Patterson Airforce Base, roughly 60 miles north, and they said they had no activity or drills going on that night.  Below is a weather report confirming what I perceived.  We had gentle winds from the west, not the northeast, and clear skys.  I am a professional in the finance industry.  The other adults that observed, along with the children ranging in ages, is a high school teacher and a sales vp for a manufacturing firm.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsYN9vdb0Gw&feature=youtube_gdata_player  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66j4DPRYjCU&feature=youtube_gdata_player  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7s_tEJU0-c&feature=youtube_gdata_player  CLIMATE REPORT NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WILMINGTON OH 533 AM EDT SUN APR 27 2014   .................................  .THE CINCINNATI OH CLIMATE SUMMARY FOR APRIL 26 2014...

As I hit the sidewalk and began walking West, I looked up at the sky and saw several distinct points of light - which looked much like stars against the clear blue sky background.  These points of light formed a large square.  I viewed this with both the naked eye, and with my polarized sunglasses.   I quickly ran into the house to retrieve my binoculars, but by the time I returned - a minute or so later - nothing was there to be seen.  I put away the binoculars and began my walk.  A short distance down the street, I saw a single, bright point of light in the same area of the sky.  This remained stationary until approximately 11:30 am, and I have not seen anything else as of the time of this report.  I am mainly reporting this because I really hope to hear that someone else around the Cincinnati Tri-State witnessed the event.  It is a s! unny day here, clear blue sky and I have never seen what appeared as a small constellation-like group of stars showing up in the daytime sky.  Just before 11:30 a large airliner flew on a N-NW to S-SE path and would have appeared to have been between myself and the object I was seeing.",

We sadly did not see any meteors, but witnessed something else.   I caught a really bright white flash out of the corner of my eye first and directed my attention towards it.  It more or less blinked in and out of view several times. I  pointed it out to my wife whom was standing right next to me.  She didn't see it at first but finally saw it.  That was the first UFO that really had me scratching my head.  Mind you it was a beautiful night out very little cloud cover and stars all over.  After that initial sighting we observed probably 3 or 4 more in a span of about 5-10 minutes.  I initially thought it possibly have been a satellite or something.  They all just kinda flashed and disappeared and flashed again.  I was astounded as was my wife.   I really was hoping to find more reports of this because it was such a nice night and figured there would have been more people outside that night that may have seen them.  I thought they possibly could have been meteors, but, I have never seen a meteor act that way, usually they are more like a shooting star to the best of my knowledge. All in all it was very bizarre.  I just couldn't wrap my head around it and neither could she.   Thanks for having this site.  I just had to toss this out there and see if anything similar had been seen.",

We are in a densely populated area, so lots of lights.  It was a clear night but generally not a lot of stars visible where we are.  I was staring up in a southern direction, around the area of Orion\u2019s Belt. I noticed a star to the immediate right of Orion's Belt that was twinkling more than the others.  It was white, same as any other star or light you would normally see at night.  As I watched, it started to actually flicker like a dying light bulb.  Very rapidly and erratically on and off.  There didn\u2019t seem to be any sort of pattern to the flickering.  This went on for maybe 15 to 20 seconds. There was then a quick brighter burst of white light, then it flickered out completely.  Didn\u2019t see it again.  About 1 to 2 seconds later, looking to the right of the first light, I saw another small white light flicker on out of nowhere.  Wasn\u2019t as bright as the first light and that was followed almost instantly by an orange burst of smaller lights.   Very faint but I would say it looked like an explosion.  There were multiple, smaller orange lights emanating from the second light.  Like something hit it and orange pieces flew off of it.  They moved out very quickly in a seashell shape, with the small side coming from the second white light \u2013 the orange pieces were moving back towards the spot of the first light.  The second flash that was followed by the orange burst was visible for maybe a total of 3-4 seconds? I was looking up in the sky for a few minutes but once I notice the first light flickering, the entire event took 20-30 seconds? I couldn\u2019t tell any shapes other than they looked like any other star in the sky.  The first white light was same size, color, shape.  The second white light was smaller and fainter as were the orange pieces. Totally guessing on distance here.  I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d.  If I were to hold a ruler up, I\u2019d guess the first light was 5 inches to the right from the Orion\u2019s Belt.  The second light was another 4 to 5 inches from the first light.",

      "story": "Travel time was way shorter than it should have been (missing time?) I keep recollecting this incident so decided to submit a report.  This happened sometime in the summer/very early fall between 1993 and 1995, in the days before GPS and automated navigation, and before we had kids.  My wife and I decided to drive from North Alabama to Western New York State to visit her parents.  Since our route was taking us nearby Ft. Thomas, KY, where her aunt lived at the time, we agreed we would stop there for the night and take her aunt with us to New York State. In those days, I prided myself on my map-based navigational skills and ability to predict our arrival time to within 15 minutes, even driving hundreds of miles.  I was never off by more than a couple minutes, ever.  The first part of the trip to Ft. Thomas was uneventful, and we arrived within my predicted timeframe.  The second part of the trip from Ft. Thomas to our destination in western NYS, I predicted to be around 530 miles with a travel time of 7hrs 45 min to 8 hrs in duration (which gives an average interstate speed of about 66 mph, including stops).  All went well and we had a great trip.  I seem to recall that the last leg of the journey (maybe 50-100 miles) seemed a bit off from where I expected to be, like I took the wrong exit, but we easily knew where we were, and we made it to the in-laws as expected. When we arrived, the in-laws seemed surprised.  They were not expecting us so soon, even though I had given them the expected arrival time the day before, and we had spoken to them when we left, so they would know when we started.  The problem was, we arrived over 2 hours earlier than predicted, based on mileage and travel time from KY to western NYS. My wife, her aunt, and I were totally confused about how we got there so fast.  We checked the distances, and reran the calculations several times, each time showing the original, predicted 8 hour travel time and predicted arrival time (taking time zones into account).  I don\u2019t remember if we ever checked the odometer (it seems that we would have), nor what the mileage was.  Getting there in 6 hours would have had us averaging over 88 mph.  I never drive that fast, and couldn\u2019t through the city areas, and would have surely remembered doing so.   After a very short while we shrugged it off and went about our business.  However, in the weeks and years after, we talked about it off and on, and agree we all felt very weirded out.  It was a memorable experience. Other than driving through Cincinnati near the start and feeling like we took the wrong exit and road at the end, I don\u2019t have any particular memories of the trip, of how we actually got from Ft. Thomas to our destination, where/when we got gas or made stops, or if we ate along the way.  Everything is a blur to each of us.  However, I do feel like at some point, I asked my passengers \"do you believe in them now.\u201d  But it is a fuzzy memory, and I don\u2019t know if I asked it, or if I somehow inserted that into my memory of that day.  What I do know is that we made impossible time on that trip, corroborated by outside witnesses, and we three travelers have no idea how we did it.  And I have seen plenty of strange things and had a number of odd experiences in my life, a number of which I have reported to this site.

The object virtually flew right over my head (seemed to be less than 1/4 mile to the west), yet it was 100% silent.  It is difficult to estimate its size, as I could only make out the lights and not the body of the craft itself.  The lights numbered between 6 and 10 and were arranged in a triangle.  They were very dim, such that if I hadn't already been looking in that direction with my pupils adjusted to view the dim starlight I certainly wouldn't have seen it.  The lights didn't blink or change at all, and also lacked any discernable hues, appearing to be a dim grey shade.  It traveled in a straight line and was out of sight in a matter of 10 seconds or less, seemingly covering several miles in that brief window of time.",
