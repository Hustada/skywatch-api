My, sister, brother, and I were walking home one evening from a church meeting and we looked up and saw a spacecraft hovering in front of us.  It was huge and was grayish in color, disk shaped, and had lots of windows going across it.  It also had revolving lights in the middle of it.  I don\u2019t remember any noise coming from it.  It stayed in front of us as we walked a couple blocks and then it moved away very fast and was gone.  We told our parents but didn\u2019t think to report it.  As time went on I thought people would think we were crazy if we talked about it.  I was 17 years old at that time, and now I\u2019ll be 60 this year.

      "story": "Saw three white objects in clear blue sky flying against the wind in triangular formation. I was sitting in the back yard at my Girlfriend's house at 5:15 CDST in Grand Rapids, Minnesota.  We had just returned from Hibbing, Minnesota where we were shopping.  We were about to relax and have a drink. I was leaning back in my chair looking up at the sky which was almost totally clear and blue, except for clouds near the horizon.  Basically , it wa a totally clear sky, bright with sunlight.  Windy. My girlfriend was checking on her flowers.  I saw 3 white spots in the sky slightly southwest of vertical (toward Duluth).  I thought they might be fighter airplanes which do pass over at times.  And I thought they could be white birds.  However these objects were very, very high or at least appeared to be and I could not see any definition in the shape as you might with a bird or plane.  My girlfriend thought they appeared triangular. At first sight these spots were in a straight line and proceeding to the Northwest  by West.  I thought I might have seen a tether, but I may have simply interpreted the regular in line motion as tethered.  I was thinking of baloons.  But the fact was I knew that the objects did not appear as baloons or aircraft or birds.  The three spots were not shiny.  They were dead white.  They proceeded in a straight line as though on the wind.  I think the wind was in the opposite direction.  Very soon after first sight the objects moved in relation to each other, first appearing in the shape of an \"L\" with two fairly close together, almost touching.  But as the movement went on the three objects took positions at the vertices of a perfect equalateral triangle.  The triangle did not rotate.  There was no sound.  The motion was very steady as you see in a flight of birds.  As the white spots moved more to the Northwest, they stopped.  Abruptly.  The motion seemed kind of chaotic at that point, but reorginized and then began moving more or less straight south. It was then that the spots disappeared.  On first sight, with the objects in line, the appearance was quite different, but I would say the distance between the two outer objects or spots and the center was about the same as the distance between the points of the triangel shape later assumed.   If the points were tied together, the changing shape might have been that of triangle being rotated so that I just saw it from a different angle.  In the middle of this incident I got a cell phone call from my daughter about band practice.  That distracted me as I tried to get her to go and look. I called the Duluth Air National Guard security service at 5:45, a half hour after the sighting because maybe they had it on radar.  Of course, I didn't get any information and really, I was happy just to report what I saw. I am certain that the thing I saw was white.  Dead white. Not shiny.  It didn't change direction quickly although it may have been going very fast.  It must have disappeared instantly.  I don't know how high it was.  Certainly higher than birds flying.  And. . . I have never seen any thing like it and I have never made a report before.  I am 67 years old.",

My 11 year old son came running into the house with a frightened dog telling me he had just seen something strange in the yard.  He said he was walking the dog and she suddenly saw something and got scared.  He looked up and saw a rectangular object with rounded sides in the air (I found out later he meant the sides were convex).  It was white with a wide blue stripe and was partially hidden by trees in our yard, but was in front of trees further away in our yard.  He described it as waving back and forth, then moving off to the right of his view further behind the trees where he could not see it anymore.  He said it seemed to be about 4 to 6 inches wide and about 18 inches long.  It was at an angle, not perfectly vertical.  He said it made no sound.  It did not give off light.  He insisted it was not a balloon, nor a piece of windblown trash or a kite.  There was a very light breeze, but that area of the yard is shielded from wind by trees.  I inspected the area a few minutes later.  There was no sign of any debris or trash (which would have likely been snagged in some pines trees, based upon the direction of the breeze).  He is a very grounded person and does not make up stories.  I have no idea what he saw, and I am at a loss to explain it.  We live in a rural area on a fairly busy highway, but trees isolate our house from the road.  Our dog is timid, but the fact she was the first to see something and reacted before my son saw it, makes me think he absolutely saw something real.",

It is very hard to come up with a approximate size or distance since the sky was so nice, but for one second I thought it might be a hot air balloon  so I asked my aunt  if she had binoculars or something like it, she went inside and handed me a set of bird watching monocular ( it looks like only one side of a binoculars. It took me a while to sight the object with the monocular but finaly I did and TADA! it was not a baloon, The best description of the object is a big red sphere with three smaller orange smi-spheres toghether, one thing that was very interesting was that we were able to see  some sort of \"vapor\" around it (like when the asfalt is very hot) The object started moving slowly  north, almost like drifting, then it stop completly and started moving south east this time a bit faster and longer to the point that we almost losted in between houses but all of the sudden the thin just rocketted  north west to the oposite side, the speed was not super super fast but but it was faster than anything that I have ever seen flying including fighter planes specially considering how hight it was. just a second after the thing blasted across the sky what it look like a business \"lear\" jet cross the sky with the same trajectory almost as if it was fallowing IT.",

The sighting was South of Lake Michigan Drive and West of Covell Road.    A few more things I would like to point out.  The craft may have been 3 to 4 times the size that I stated (200-300 ft.)  As we were driving up Cenntenial Drive (steep incline) the lights caught my eye.  It was about 20-30 miles away, it was coming at us at a very high rate of speed.  It had multiple lights rotating around the middle of the saucer.  As in other reports that I read, the middle of the craft did not come to a point, it had was a verticle surface (5-10 feet or more)  The strangest thing was that as soon as the spot lights under the object focused on us (my friend who was driving killed the lights and coasted to the end of the road, so I felt it did not know we were there) it rose and speed off at an unbelievable rate of speed (thousands of miles an hour or more)  I was in the passenger seat and never took my eyes off of it.  It traveled 30 miles in two or three seconds.  We jumped on 196 East and followed it for about ten minutes.  It looked like a moving star off in the distance. The strangest thing of all is that after we headed back home, none of us spoke about it to each other or anyone that night (family members, etc.).  It wasn't until weeks later that we were all hanging out together, and I mentioned it as a dream.  Instantly both of my friends who were with me had the wierdest looks on thier faces.  I could tell they were freaked out.  We had one or two other friends present at this time.  They thought we were joking.  Each of us took turns telling exactly the same thing that happened. If anyone would like to talk to me about this, I would like to talk to someone if possible.",

I came home after visiting with my parents and doing some grocery shopping.  When I turned into the street where I lived, I saw something bright in the sky that was just hovering.  At first, I thought it was a helicopter. Then, I realized that it wasn\u2019t making any noise, and it was much brighter than a helicopter. I have lived on an army base that had a helicopter unit so I knew what helicopters looked like in the night sky. I had noticed that there was a row of windows about the center of the sphere.  I did go into my home to put away my groceries, but something compelled me to go back outside.  I stared at the object for at least 30 minutes. There was no movement.  It just hovered. After awhile, I started to feel frightened and I had a strange feeling of being watched. I decided to get my digital camera, and despite my fear decided to go back outside. I went back outside to take pictures, but the craft was gone.  It was a white bright light, but it is was obvious that it was a sphere.  You could see the outline of the sphere.  I will never forget it for as long as I live.  I was never so scared in my life!",

Today I was taking Christmas lights down out of my oak tree in my yard when out of nowhere I noticed a triangle craft moving quickly though the sky.  Looking up at it, it was silver/white in color and silent.   I am not sure how high it could have been, only that I figure to measure about 1 half inch in width across  the sky.  It moved in a very straight line from east to west.  By the time I could get my wife to see what I was seeing, it was already gone.  \tThe thing that makes this so unusual to me is the fact it made no noise.  If it was high enough to be  inaudible to the human hear I figure I would have seen a contrail from its engine or engines.  However there was none.  Also, this object was triangular and resembled nothing like an ordinary airplane I am very used to seeing in the skies flying over the mid-west region.

I noticed a white light coming over the visual horizon and heading in my direction.  It took approximately 1 or 2 minutes for the craft to come into closer view and stopped over our complex.  It was shaped like a \"top\" and had spot lights around the entire circumference of the craft.  The lights were like spot-lights and fanned the ground.  It sounded like a turbine engine and rumbled the building.  My brother was next to me but not at the window.  He heard the sound, but when prompted to come look, he refused and waiting to long before attempting to look and missed it.  I went down to my mom and told her what I seen.  She said she heard it but it was a jet.  She didn't believe me and neither did my brother. The following morning, I discussed the event with a neighbor friend who also verified him and his parents seen the same thing.  Humoring me, my mom called the airforce and asked if anyone else had reported anything.  They said no. Granted, I was young and only in 3rd grade.  But as a boy, I know what a jet looks like.  I know what a helicopter looks like.  This vehicle had no wings and no props. and yet it sounded like a jet.  Besides the only jet that could hover that we were aware of was the harrier.

      "story": "Triangle in sky hovered for several minutes, moved overhead and flew away within seconds Was driving home on a residential street in a suburban neighborhood. My 16-year old daughter was in the car with me. She noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of us and asked if it was the North Star. I looked for a few moments, then told her that no star was that bright. I then racked my brain to see if any planets were visible this time of year. The light was approximately 250-300 feet above ground. As we neared closer, we could see that rather than one bright light, it was actually two white lights and two red lights that were blinking intermittently. I said to her, \"Must be an airplane.\" As we neared even closer, I wondered out loud to her, \"But airplanes don't hover.\" The lights were remaining still in one spot directly in front of us. We could see, too, as we neared, that the lights were lower than first appeared, or perhaps had moved closer to the ground. The lights were not moving at all, other than blinking. It seemed odd and also apparent to me, that at my snail pace of 30mph, I was actually \"catching up\" with whatever it was. I told my daughter that we would find out what it was in a few seconds, because we're going to pass right under it. The object was still hovering in one spot. What happened next is unimaginable and outlandish. We passed under the object, which took 2-3 seconds at my drive of 30mph.  As we passed underneath, we could see that the object was triangular with round corners, the body was metallic, and corner of the triangle had a brightly colored light.  One light was green.  One light was red. I believe, but can't be positive, that the third light was white.  Directly connecting the large corner lights were smaller red and white lights that blinked in a row. The front of the triangle (the longer side) had an amazing glow from it, as if from interior lights.  We passed under in absolute shock. As we passed it, we both turned to each other and shouted. \"That was a UFO!\" My daughter said. I quickly pulled into a side street and turned my car around, in an attempt to catch back up to the object.  By the time I had pulled in, backed up and turned around the object was almost gone from sight. It was now moving at a ridiculous speed away from us.  I sped up, but within seconds the lights were completely gone from sight. Had my daughter not been in the car with me and witnessed what I had seen, I would have thought I had lost my mind.",

After the light in the sky vanished, I saw what looked like lightning in the distance around all of the trees on the lake.   As we were coming in to dock the boat, I looked around the lake one last time and saw some flashing lights on the ground and they were orange also.

I went outside just before midnight, to smoke a cigarette and looked up at the stars and saw a formation of 5 golden lights speeding across the sky West/northwest.  I stared in disbelief, then I saw two more reddish golden disks flying (one slightly behind the other) much lower and extremely fast.  I started backpedaling and tapped on the window to the room where my fiance was and before she came out I saw five more heading northwest.  By the time she came outside they were gone, but I just said, look at the stars...then bam, 3 more just flew West right then.  We witnessed a few more flying west and then I called my parents (looking at my phone I believe it was 12:07 when I called my mom and I talked to her for 11 minutes about what I was seeing)  My phone wasn't working first, but just as it finally started ringing and she answers, (she lives in Kalamazoo Michigan) two more flew over heading due west completely silent and extremely fast.  I witnessed 3 more formations as I talked to her, but I started seeing so many, I lost count of how many were in which formation.  Every formation was heading west or northwest, except one lone formation of 3 that traveled southeast.  The whole time I was seeing them, I only saw one airplane with blinking lights and one helicopter which was extremely huge and loud (it was flying very low, so I could see it was like a Huey and had only red lights)...my fiance had went into the house to file a report and I stayed outside and kept seeing these things.  At about 12:30am she came out and we called a number to report what we had seen, and two flew over very low and fast heading northwest.  I talked to someone on the phone for 4 minutes, and the helicopter flew over during the call. then we tried to call the airport, but only got automated answers.  I also was shocked when I witnessed a small flash and shower of sparks in the sky to the north.  It looked as though something may have exploded.  These things were a goldish somewhat red color and traveled in formations of 2, 3, or 5.  I lost count, but I saw at least 2 dozen.  They were silent, extremely swift, and mostly stayed in very tight rigid formations, that were shaped like triangles, or an upside down check mark.  Two or 3 of the formations were loose on one side, with the things weaving back and forth, while the other side of the formation stayed in a tight line.  The lights DID NOT blink ever.  The ones that were flying lower looked as though they had a ring of light golden light around them.  They moved easily 10X faster than the airplane I saw to the north (which had blinking lights that were greenish)  There wasn't a cloud in the sky, and I saw no moon.  If I had to guess, I'd saw they were heading towards Muskegeon and Lake Michigan.  I have NEVER seen anything like what I saw tonight.  I have seen meteor showers, shooting stars, satellites, airplanes, helicopters, planets, and the MOON of course.  I can't say what to use for a background, but the formations with 5 all had objects the size of stars and were flying much higher I believe.  The lower flying formations which only had 2 or 3 objects were much larger than stars.  Probably 4x the size of a star.  These larger objects were moving incredibly fast.  Even the smaller objects moved easily 10 times faster than the airplane to the north. We do not have any camera to take pictures.  And these things were so fast and some of them were so high, I highly doubt anyone could capture them on film.  It would just be a blurry mess I think.  I hope someone has at least tried to capture them though.  It was unlike anything I've ever witnessed in my life.  When I witnessed the shower of sparks, I did not see any objects around it and it was to the north.  It was around 12:30 when I saw it and my fiance just missed seeing it too as she was dialing a number for me and our house blocked her view.  This is all I have to say.  I would suggest following up in Muskegeon and around Lake Michigan and the Gerald Ford airport here in Grand Rapids....  I hope someone else saw this besides us.  It was so unique.",

After I had been watching it for about 10 minutes we seemed to be getting closer to it so I assume that it had slowed down.  At the point in which we were almost horizontal from it, it suddenly dropped from the sky. I don't know if it suddenly landed being that it was not that far off the ground to begin with or just went invisible.  That is what I am entirely confused about.

These four shapes caught up with the other three, and together they all moved in unison in a south-westerly direction.  It was really something to see.  I'm sure I wasn't the only one to notice them.  They were so close: 500-1,000 ft.",

A few minutes later we spotted the same or another one, same exact shape.  This one was at a bit lower altitude than the first.  It stopped and stayed in one place for a while and then got back up to speed.  It disappeared over the horizon.   Later that night, my other room mate got home and we smoked a cigarette.  Like clockwork, as I told him about what I saw earlier another one appeared, this one much closer than the others.  Much lower altitude.  This one didn't have any light emitting from it though. Looked like a black ball.  By this time it was getting dark so we couldn't make out any details on it.  It eventually disappeared into the horizon too.

      "story": "Two lights, three lights, four lights, gone! I was driving behind my wife on Butterworth.  We turned onto O\u2019Brien St and I was instantly drawn to two lights in front of me in the distance.  At first I thought they were car lights but soon realized they were up in the sky. The next thing that came to mind was a plane with its landing gear down and lights on. There just seemed to be something odd about them though.  There was no red and they weren\u2019t blinking at all.  Just two bright white, almost blue lights.  As big as the lights were, if it were a plane I think I would have seen it moving. Now I\u2019m thinking a brand new cell tower.  As I got to where they were almost to my side up in the sky, I slowed the vehicle way down almost to a stop and looked for the tower itself.  Realizing it was way too dark to see a tower at night, I focused back up on the lights again. Now there were three lights, all the same, in a triangular pattern. I am now at a complete stop in the middle of the road intrigued by these lights.  I decide to pull up off the road and am trying to do so without taking my eyes of the lights but have to look away to pull over.  When I look back there are now four lights in a nonsymmetrical diamond pattern.  Kind of like one end was stretched way out. I am at a complete stop with my window down.  The lights are at a stand still too when all of a sudden they move a long distance in a second and stop again and then start slowly moving.  Now I know this is not a plane and I am thinking it\u2019s not a helicopter.  I think if a helicopter were to move  like that the lights would have had to tilt.  They didn\u2019t.  They always stayed in the same plain.   My wife\u2019s phone call wondering if everything was OK broke my gaze on the lights.  When I looked up for them again I couldn\u2019t find them.  They were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

I observed them for about 30 seconds, and then they were gone. July 25, (2014) (sic.  Corrected by witness to July 23rd, 2014) I was about five minutes from home, when again, I saw some of the same type of lights.  I pulled into a parking lot, and counted 7 of them.  They were at a fairly low altitude, coming out of the northwest heading southeast.  I almost couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing.  But there they were.  So, I came home, went out in my backyard with my Brother, and they were still there, moving fairly slow. We counted about 9 this time.  The last one that appeared was bright red, then changed to orange.  About that time, we  saw an aircraft coming from North to South.  It was probably at about 35,000 feet.  It looked quite distant relative to the strange lights.  After that I did a little research online, and saw similar accounts of the same type of lights.  I would not make something like this up.  I  have nothing to gain from it.  I just wanted to report it, and would like to know if there were any other accounts on the objects I saw.

      "story": "UFO flying around, and then stopping in mid-air- bright flashing lights. The sighting happened on 7/22/2014, ((sic.  07/23/2014)) at around 1:30 am.  I walked out a bar and to a car. When I sat in the car, I noticed something was gliding in the air.  I assumed it was a plane, so I didn't stare at it too long.   About 5 or 10 minutes went by, and then I saw my friends coming out from the bar and in front of the car I was in.  I looked up, and the craft was still up in the air, just sitting there.  It wasn't moving at all, and at that moment I realized what its shape was and how close it was.  No noises came from it, even though it was fairly large.   I got out of the car, and walked to where my friends were.  I still didn't hear anything.  It was flashing these bright lights, mostly red.  It was in a big long strip around the hemisphere of the craft, and it seemed like it was a lot of smaller lights making it look like a red strip. Inside the red strip were little bright red dots, so I assume that means those were individual lights.  Sometimes it flashed green on one side, and sometimes blue on the other side.  The red was almost always on.  I think i might have seen another color, but all I can remember is red, green, and blue.  The craft flashed the lights in weird patterns, sometimes it was just still, sometimes the lights flashed.  It was dark out, so they were very bright and intense.  It was hard to see what color the craft was, because of the light, but I think it was metallic.  I know for sure it was shaped like a UFO.  It was a flying saucer, more round than flat.  We were quite close to this craft too, close enough to get a good look at it.   My friends and I watched this craft move and glide around in the air, taking sharp turns in weird directions.  It would stop, then lower itself straight down in a perfect fast motion, then stop.  Then it would rise up, perfectly straight, and stop mid-air.  It went even higher and higher, in the same vertical way, and then it stopped and lowered itself again. Then it would start flying around back and forth, like it was watching something.  It did this for q! uite a w hile, moving around then going up and down fast then slow. I felt like I could see something around it, but I'm not sure what that was.  I might have been seeing something as a result of those lights, but it seemed like the craft was inside of something else.   When the craft left, it just lowered itself down below the treeline, and never came back up.   I waited in the car for about 25 minutes, but it did not come back.",

During this initial conversation, I looked up into the sky saw a plane coming from the south and the plane was clear enough for me to have stated sitting in front of the wing and the rear of the wing a few times in my life.   While looking up at the air plane, reminiscing about old times, I noticed a oval shaped faintly lit orange object in the sky heading west moving about the same speed as the airplane I spoke of earlier.  I watched this object about the size of a head of a 5/32 drill bit down to a 1/8 drill bit, then all of sudden I seen about 3/4 of an inch of white smoke behind the 1/8 inch drill bit size object disappeared.  (Shapes and sizes are my point of view of the flying object from where I was standing in Grand Rapids, Michigan, while looking up into a clear blue sky the plane was about an 1 inch long in the sky. )  Keep in mind the plane was heading northeast, and the object was heading west.",

The one nearest, which was still at a high altitude, was brighter.  The other one appeared smaller, and was some distance back from the first one.  I observed them for about 30 seconds, and then they were gone. July 25, (2014), I was about five minutes from home, when again, I saw some the same type of lights.  I pulled into a parking lot, and counted 7 of them.  They were at a fairly low altitude, coming out of the northwest heading southeast.  I almost couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing.  But there they were.  So, I came home, went out in my backyard with my Brother, and they were still there, moving fairly slow. We counted about the 9 this time.  The last one that appeared was bright red, then was orange.  About that time, we an aircraft coming from North to South.  It was probably at about 35,000 feet.  It looked quite distant relative to the strange lights.  After that I did a little research online, and saw similar accounts of the same type of lights.  I would not make something like this up.  I have nothing to gain from it.  I just wanted to report it, and would like to know if there were any other accounts on the objects I saw.

I didn\u2019t see the planets this night, they would have been above my house and out of sight at the time I was outside (I can usually see them about 5:30 \u2013 6:00 am).

There was no solidity to it, just the 3 lights formed into a perfect triangle, no noise.

I watched them just disappear\u2026 almost like you\u2019d see a satellite in the sky, but these 3 stayed together.

      "story": "Multiple craft seem to witness black meteor approach over Grand Rapids, MI. Event started with two white starlike/satellite-like craft traversing the sky from North to South and \"parking\" in the sky above SE Grand Rapids area.  Then two multi-colored light, triangular vehicles moved from West to East and parked it in the Eastern Sky, estimating 10-20 miles east of GR at around 2,000ft alt.   Then a black meteor looking thing traversed the sky from the North, where the two satellites came from, to the South (near over the GRRFord airport) and the black object vanished on the Southern Horizon (I've got buildings around so I can't see the real Horizon).   A few seconds after the black object traversed the sky, a triangle of stars in the Southern sky, which I had previously not noticed except that they were there for at least 15 minutes while I was talking on the phone to my fiancee, suddenly moved in unison as if they were falling out of the sky down and to the left (as if in the direction of the black object's trajectory terminus).   I opened the porch door to tell my night nurse to come see the UFOs and she came out and saw another \"star\" fall out of the sky toward the same spot.  She freaked out and ran back inside afraid. I watched for awhile to see if anymore activity, but only saw a few of the \"blinkies\" (stars that blink on and off and move around a little - which I usually only see in thunderclouds).  The \"parked\" stars vanished while I was watching the triangle drop.   Whole thing seemed like either a greeting party or an interference party for whatever that black thing was.",

This organ-ish ball was tracking north to south at a moderate clip -- there was no con-trail observed.  When I went to grab a witness the anomalous object was overhead, still tracking north to south.  Several minutes later, with the witness in hand, we observed that the object was now way off to the east and was tracking to the southwest.   It made quite a course correction in a short amount of time!   Eventually the object got too far out of range for us to see.  Neither the witness, nor myself have seen anything like it before.

I am guessing I was about 3 years old so possibly about 1955.  There was just a hint of light over the hill seen from the window, just enough to see 2 creatures come in through the window, which now makes no sense being the bedroom was on the second floor.  One of the creatures came to my crib, it was about head high to where I was lying.  The other creature went to the other crib but I did not see what was done to my brother if anything.  I do not know why I did not scream?  The creature stuck a needle into my hand near the thumb, but I felt nothing.  They left.  I woke up in the morning and immediately told my parents who said that I was dreaming. I knew nothing about aliens at that age and doubt there was anything on the TV in 1955. There was a red mark on my hand where the needle went in and it remained for about 18 years as a red like mole.  My hand was burned in an accident in my teens so th! e mark is gone, just the burn scar remains. Years later when i read reports on the small human like creatures it occurred to me what could have happened.  I am now almost 68 and still remember the incident vividly. I cannot remember my dreams from last night so am still convinced that something unexplained happened to me. I am not aware of any other incidents in my life like this.",
