The star actually grew in size.  Initially, my first thought was it was a comment (sic.  Comet) that I was seeing coming in straight on so I couldn't see the tail when it got to what I would say is double in size it just disappeared like somebody turned off the light.  So naturally, I was then staring at the sky and called my girlfriend to come to look but it was too late that's when I noticed what I first thought was two seagulls because they were a white silverish color and quiet.  After observing for 2 or 3 minutes they came in to focus and looked as to disc or could have been just round my view was from directly underneath.  They were at about 1000 feet and traveled very smoothly until they were out of site.  The whole event lasted about 10 min.  The disk was also witnessed by my girlfriend.   I and my girlfriend are in our 30's! and I would say we are the average well respected  working Americans. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

My mother, my three oldest brothers, and I walked out of our house in the evening to drive to church to attend a Coffeehouse function (that\u2019s what they were called).  It was evening and dark but not too late \u2013 I would venture to guess it was bet. 6:30 and 7:30pm.  We saw something that astonished us in the night sky.  Looking NW we saw a huge vessel that was not very high in the sky, over the field in the back of our house.  We lived on a court and there was a 3 or 4 acre field behind our house.  The UFO was about 500 feet up, moving very slowly toward the SE, noiselessly.  I have a very good picture in my mind of it \u2013 it largely resembled the typical UFO spacecraft, just like the \u201cJupiter Two\u201d from the \u201cLost in Space\u201d series.  On the bottom of the craft were large, lit panels.  We all remarked upon this \u2013 how amazing it was to see.  We knew instantly that what we were seeing was otherworldly.  It was so close, so large, and moving without sound.  After it departed, at a constant but slow speed, I don\u2019t know why we didn\u2019t just all go back inside and call the police.  I do remember that we went inside to tell my father what we had seen (he was home babysitting my little brother), but we then just proceeded to go on to church.  We all compared notes in the car ride to church, \u201cYep, it looked just like the Jupiter Two\u201d we agreed.  At church we asked folks if they had seen it \u2013 only one or two people said they had heard there was some kind of large weather balloon in the area that was being tested.  This was no weather balloon.  It was directly over the field in our backyard.  I know what I saw.  I\u2019d love to see it again sometime.  Hopefully I\u2019ll have the presence of mind to videotape next time!  (I do not know the exact date of this event.  I thought the year had to be \u201973 or \u201974.

Our house had a large open field that ended in woods. My aunt & uncle lived in the house next to us, large field separated our houses. I remember the weather being a cool summer evening; remember the grass being cool on my bare feet, light warm breeze, just before dark.  I was in my Aunts kitchen when my mother took my hand and followed my aunt into her back yard where the other children were, everyone was standing still, staring about 4-6 ft maybe at one, maybe more, flat oval shaped,  glowing softly sphere, that was silent. The colors inside reminded of the colorful swirls you see in a soap bubble. I remember thinking to myself if I could touch it my hand would go right through it. It felt like it was watching us too. I stood there holding my mother\u2019s hand, motionless, like everyone for what it seemed like an hour, more likely 15-20minutes. I remember hearing someone whisper \u201cwhat is it\u201d but no one answered, maybe for fear it would go away, we all just stared in silence, then all of a sudden\u2026like a camera flash, it was gone? I never recall our families ever talking about it? Maybe the older ones did. I\u2019m now 45 years old, recently, talking family and friends about UFO\u2019s unexplained things etc... I asked my older sister, who was there that night, if she'd remember the lighted sphere or was I just recalling a stupid childhood dream that stayed with me? She immediately replied, \"Oh my God!! That is so weird! I was just thinking of that the other day and telling a co-worker about it. I had never brought it up before, just one of those things, you store away until something brings it to mind.

About 100 feet above me was a huge hovering craft with a \"Capitol\" shaped dome on top and the same shape on the bottom separated by a ring.  It hummed as the top dome spun in one direction and the bottom in another.  It was as clear as day.  Each half of the craft had rows of lighted windows.  I had never heard of UFO's before, so there was no preconceived notion to create interpret anything in my mind.  Awestruck, I looked back into the house, where I saw a friend about to exit and called him to come see.  As he stood next to me and looked up, I asked him, \"Do you see that?\", pointing to the craft.  He answered affirmatively and described what I was seeing.

I was driving n look up n there was this lit object moving very fast in the most metaphysical ways.  Up down n back around.  It stopped in the sky in the clouds n got bright as the sun.  it was still dark out so it lit up the sky.  this was very frightening.  it looked like a black canopy with a hole cut in it with light on the other side. I thought it might b a nuke.  Then I saw two fighter jets fly toward it then it dissapeared.  The smoke trail it left was incredible. Figure eights, zig-zags, then at the top a perfect 3d cube.  None of our phones would work to take a pic.  Well bout five to nine fighter jets began flying straight up then down and all over all morning.  I was in seven 11 parkin lot n pointed them out to bystanders, who at the time were oblivious.  they were shocked at the site of the fighter jets.  I was so excited by the incident, that i called my dad to tell him of the events, n to c if he could see the jets.  I called my exgirlfriend who lives in philadelphia, n she said there were a bout 8 fighter jets in the sky up there, this was around 9a.m.  My dad called back and said there had been a newsflash of the reports.  The media said that the government shot off two missles off of an island off of virginia.  They made no mention of why, and made no other mention of it.  They blamed the smoke trail on the weather.  The smoke trail itself was incredible because it sat in the air for a good ten minutes.   i have met six other people than my friends that witnessed the same event.  The fighter jets were in the sky until dark.  My exgirlfriend told me that she saw on the news that they were saying they released a new fighter jet that day, explaining why they were in the sky.  Y did the government shoot off rockets for no reason, then have fighter jets go after it.  The hole the others from the ohare airport describe sounds similar to ! the ligh t n how it dissapeared.  It was the most amazing thing my eyes have seen.  They cant deny the truth forever. 1 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous;  provides only telephone number.

Angle of original trajectory was about 20 degrees upwards towards the south and bending in a south-southeasterly direction; slowly, at first, then increasing its speed (was much faster than a plane, that would appear as the same size). Travelled in a small arc (towards the west), until going out of sight. There were no colors; just the bright white star-like dot. No sound (although it looked too high for any sound to be detected.)When first seen, it was slightly above the tree-tops in the east of my position. Could easily be seen, even with the ground lights below it. (Had a similar sighting about 10 months ago, which was not reported)",

Well, I looked-up, and saw an object movie across the day-sky.   I thought, \"It looks odd.\"  I could only see three silver dots, in the shape of the sky as they moved at the speed of normal aircraft across the sky...maybe we make triangle shaped ships.   I could not see any body structure, just three dots.   Whitish-silver, but not glowing, metallic looking.  I could see the object, assume some light, but could not discount reflection...hologram?  It was windy, and it moved consistently, way high up. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Description: I am rewriting my previous report b/c it lacked clarity, but not due to misspelled words...due to my not proofing my own work until it goes out. Anyway, again, on Saturdays, I lay under unshaded windows, often until noon or so, after I go out for breakfast, thinking, reading, sleeping, fuming, laughing.   This Saturday, at around 12:00 PM, I looked up and saw three silver dots, smaller than the tips of my fingers moving in the shape of a triangle...less than a tenth the  size of the tips of my finger, that's how high-up it seemed...they moved across the sky at a normal rate of speed for a craft as high-up as this one.   I thought maybe the wind, which was kicking-up, had carried something skyward, so I watched until it went out of vision's range, but it wasn't an object kicked about by the wind...too regular...watched about a minute until it went out of view.   No solid object could I see, though upclose it might be solid, but just three dots.   Can't say it glowed...may have reflected...maybe holographic...maybe we have something new up in the sky these days.    Maybe it was how the sun hit, but it seems like the sun would have changed as it glistened across a metallic cover...not a light, but more of a reflection.  Whitish-silver.  Or, maybe, it was three very distant normal craft moving in perfect formation. I just don't know...they were close, though...if they measure less one tenth the tip of my finger, then the three together measured half, or less, than the tip.

I also love to (try so far) photograph shooting stars, and have witnessed many.  Some during the day, but most at night. They always have some sort of trail of either smoke or still burning fragments.   Also, when they are traveling in the lower atmosphere, they actually burn a more red color instead of the white plasma seen in the high atmosphere stage.  This I can say for sure...It had no tail, it was close (maybe 650 feet away at 60 degree angle to horizon), it was completly quiet.  it was traveling pefectly straight/level/south, the light looked the same coming and going, it was round, and the light (which was all I saw) had a very strange quality to it. It was very clean or pure looking, and didn't blink at all.  Like a giant l.e.d light, that had a sligly stronger output of blue spectrum.   I swear on all that is good in this world, that this is not a hoax, and that I have truthfully relayed all facts in this matter in the way that I understand them to have occured.",

Before I could hardly register what I was seeing, the light zoomed directly at me with incredible speed. Astonishingly, the globe was silent, and did not seem to disturb the night air.  For a split second I was face to face with this thing.  I jumped because I thought it was going to hit me.  Then it veered off quickly to the right and moved rapidly around the side of my house and was gone.  I tried to run into the other room to see if I could still see it, but I never saw it again.

What I am sure of is myself, brother, mother and father were standing in our front yard in Mt Washington, Maryland, and we saw this craft slowly drifting across in front of us about 300 feet away and 300 feet up.  It was not an airplane, helicopter, glider, balloon, inflated object (hoax) or anything we have ever seen.  It reminded me now of the Jefferson airplane blimp if you ever seen that on their album or poster.  It sort of looked like a cross between a box kite and balloon but was not either of those at all.  It was close enough that I remember seeing the operator of this craft staring at us, as it drifted by.  Time seemed to stand still and it also seemed as though we were under the control of the operator of this craft--very, very strange indeed.  I think about this often and would love some answers.  I have other experiences which have happened later on in my life which really make it seem as though I\u2019ve been abducted several times.

It seemed stationary at first, then it started moving very slowly side to side...as I kept looking, I could see what first appeared to be an airplane coming in from the left, but when I looked at it closer there were a series of white and red lights that were flashing side to side - it was small from my angle, but I could still tell it wasn't a plane. It came in fairly near to the first bright light and stopped in mid air, then started getting brighter and brighter like someone was turning on a light switch. They both stayed stationary, and alternated between dimming and getting stronger. Then, out of nowhere, a light just flickered out of the darkness and appeared, creating a triangle - one that started moving slowly in formation, all of the lights together. Then it changed shape a bit as each light moved, and a couple of them flickered out...weirdly, though, the one bright light was still there (it never went away until the very end). For the next hour or so, more and more ships or whatever they were would come in...at one point, there were five of them, all really bright and at all different levels of the sky. These ships, again, looked like airplanes at first - but they would change direction, go directly vertical in the air, and also stop completely and become stationary. Many times, the lights would also descend below the trees so that I couldn't see them, making them too close to the earth to be a plane. Occasionally they would all go away and I would think that it was over...only to look back out a minute later and see another triangle. About an hour and a half into this, I went out to the hallway of my dorm and called 5 more people in, all of whom saw the same thing. So with me and my roommate, that makes 7 witnesses that I now know of, and I think they were going to! tell mo re people as well. The climax was near the end, when there were actually five lights that made a large V-formation, two on either arm near the top and one in the center. It very slowly rotated, and then the lights went out. This just stopped happening about five minutes ago...actually, wait - I just looked back out again and there are two more lights back in the sky, with the same pattern as before.

It was the size of a large star but, as the object came closer overhead, it grew almost to the size of a full moon. It suddenly veered off towards the south and only a white tip, the size of a large star, was visible with the exception of a black rectangular shadow that seemed attached to the tip. There were small sparks/flames from the tip (like a firework}. It moved exceedingly rapidly.  It then vanished for a split second. Suddenly, in its place appeared a huge, clearly defined horizontal teardrop shaped object--with 2 extending tips on each end at the middle - that was a brilliant orange. This object was the size of at least two (2) full moons not including the tips. The object was not moving.  Just as suddenly this entire object turned beautiful neon green. The shape did not change nor did object move. Then, all of a sudden there appeared, at the top middle and middle rear part of the object, what appeared to be cartoon lightening streaks. In other words these streaks were jagged, had width but were very small in comparison (approximately 3 - 4 regular stars in length). They were gold in color. They did not move nor did they glow. They did not seem like rays and their shape was clearly defined. Just as suddenly the entire object completely disappeared without any trace. There was no noticeable sound at any time.

      "story": "Orange orb floating over Baltimore An unexplained orange light was observed by over 15 to 20 patrons on the roof terrace of a nightclub in Baltimore, MD, at approximately 12:15 AM on Sunday, August 29, 2010. I first noticed an unusual glowing orange shape in the sky, perhaps a few thousand feet above the roof of the club, about 80 degrees above the horizon.  I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was. My initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing. The nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon. Over approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair. I tried to take a picture of the object with my phone's camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye. At least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  After I went to find others and return, patrons could no longer locate the object. The coordinates of the sighting location are 39.293' North, 76.611' West. I am currently a ((deleted--graduate)) student at a university in the Washington, DC, area.",

On July 3, 2010, 9:15 PM, I was in my back yard, between the barn and the house.  I have four bats that come out at night and was watching them eating insects.  Something caught my eye and it looked like it might be a half mile up in the sky. The object was not exactly oval shaped, but not really cigar shaped, but rather like a capsule. The back half was lit, but not with a light bulb.  The middle section was dark, and the front was identical to the back half lit, more glowing.  There was no sound, no wings, no gondola, and it appeared to be moving as if by equipment, and not the wind. I watched for approximately 4 minutes.  This object was going from approximately north to south. It disappeared by just going away in the distance. Also, it the light was not brought on by the sunset, as the sun was already down for the night. To give an estimate of how large this object may have been if on the ground it is hard to say, but my estimate would probably be in the 25-30 feet range, the height maybe 8 feet or so.  My neighbor asked me, when I told him of this, wanted to know if there were any smaller lights on it, such as what airplanes use, and there were not.",

It wasn't completely dark yet and we were looking up because of fireworks and helicopters.  I saw a light above that was a circle shape, the light was white.  It was very high in the air, way too high to be a helicopter with a spot light on, and was definitely not a plane.  I don't know the exact direction, but it came from the inner harbor area, and went over Patterson Park.  I asked everyone to look up at the light and everyone agreed it was definitely not a helicopter due to how high it was.  It seemed to be in the height of where commercial planes fly, but it was definitely not a plane.  It was about a pen cap size, definitely bigger than a star or a planet you can see with your eyes.  It moved slowly, it didn't zig or zag, just in a slow fluid way.  Then, towards the end, it was hard to see as it was like it was shimmering out of sight.  You really had to look for it to find it towards the end, then it just disappeared.  It was a clear night with barely any clouds in the sky so it wasn't like it disappeared behind a cloud. The light, was very solid in the center, then it was like a very slight black ring, and more light, almost like a halo around the center light.

First one would appear, travel slow and steady to the north, then a second would appear, where there first one originally appeared.   It slowly moved in the same line and toward the first.  Then a third orange light would appear, same way.   While this was happening, the first orange light would fade and disappear.  This same pattern repeated for about 10 -15 minutes.   There was no sound.  I assumed whatever it was was far away, don't know.   I did get my binoculars during all this, the lights looked like orange dots.  No other colors.  Very steady.

      "story": "An extremely large black rectangle or triangle ufo floating at tree top level outside our house. When I was a teenager, my parents and I were heading to the symphony when we saw an extremely large black rectangle or triangle ufo outside our house. The symphony started at 8pm.  My dad never wanted to be late so we left a little after 7pm to make sure we made it there in plenty of time.  Our house is on a small hill near the end of our block.  It was twilight to dark.  As we left the house and started walking down the front steps down to our car \u2013 we saw this black object floating just barely above the tree tops. It was enormous and hardly moving.  It spanned from one end of our block to the other end.  I don\u2019t know how long our block is but the object was more than the length of our block and there are 6 three story colonial houses between our house and the end of the block and the object was long enough to cover them all.  It was wide covering houses on both sides of the street.  The object was also tall or thick (maybe one story or more thick) and not aerodynamic at all.  There is no way that should be flying.  It was so large that we could never see the far side of it.  We really only could ever see 2 sides of it so it could be a rectangle or a triangle. We walked down the steps and into the middle of our street and stood directly underneath it.  It was very close nearly touching the tree tops (large oak trees in our neighborhood).  It was a matte black and blocked out the sky from our view because it was so massive.  It had lights on the underside -some large, some small, but the lights were dull and not bright.  I can\u2019t remember where the lights were but know some were different colors.  The side of the object had a window like opening which had dim lights. With an object flying so close, it should have been loud but this object didn\u2019t make a sound but you could sort of feel it in your chest.  Even blimps make sounds but this object just didn\u2019t make a sound. We stood directly underneath it for several minutes looking up and then it slowly drifted up the side street next to our house.  It went from moving straight ahead to moving at a 90 degree angle without turning.  We kept walking with it up the side street while it was directly overhead.  It was gliding so slowly that it was easy to keep walking with it. We could have kept walking with it but my dad said that he didn\u2019t want to be late for the concert and we had to go.  In the end, we watched the object for about 15 minutes.  I didn\u2019t want to go but we did.  When we got into the car, I asked my dad what it was and he said that he didn\u2019t know and didn\u2019t want us to talk about it ever again.  I tried to bring it up several times and he made it clear that we were to never discuss it.   Years went by without talking about it\u2013 when my dad was dying I asked him about it and he couldn\u2019t remember it happened.  I thought maybe it was all in my mind so a few years after my dad died I asked my mom if she remembered and she did.  This made me both relieved and uneasy.  We\u2019ve talked about it several times since then.  My father was a physician, my mother is a nurse.  I am a medical researcher. While I wasn\u2019t afraid while we were watching the object (it was oddly peaceful), those moments seeing it have haunted me almost every day since.  I\u2019ve been uneasy sleeping at my house since that initial night and have had to sleep with a light on only when I\u2019m there.  Every time I felt the slightest low hum, I rushed to my bedroom window to see if it is there. I\u2019ve since moved away but my mom still lives there.  I moved to a very large city and oddly I sleep better in this large city than at my childhood home. I can be contacted by an investigator if needed.

So that is why I find what I have observed in the above mentioned evening very peculiar. So like I said, I was looking up at the stars facing west, nothing in the s.ky.  Not even any aircraft the neighbors cat sort of distracted me so I briefly looked away from the sky.  As I looked back up I noticed what I thought were headlights to a passenger jet (above 35,000 ft.)  Traveling south to north..  No sound associated to this craft what so ever.  Also moving extremely slow for any aircraft I have ever seen from t any era.  As I was thinking to myself how it was funny how I did not notice this craft approach; the light suddenly dimmed to what looked like a satellite or a star for about ten seconds..

The formation hung suspended in the air.   I could not tell if the lights were moving away to the northeast, or fading from view.  I drove to a safer vantage point at a church parking lot on Rt 103 but fewer lights were visible and they were gone from view within another two minutes.  The last of the lights were those at the extreme right side of the formation, the lights to the east.  At first glance I thought I was looking a fireworks, but the formation covered to large an area and did not fall through the ! sky or move the way fireworks would and they remained visible for minutes not seconds the way fireworks would.  Best guess would be some sort of flares, but very unusual.  Also way too many lights to be simple air traffic.  I've lived here for the past 22 years and this was not air traffic.  Some such traffic was visible in the sky and the lights from those craft was much whiter.",

It was a crystal clear night, very pleasant weather and only 1 or 2 other dog walkers out.  As we rounded the Pagoda on the home leg of our walk I was looking south and could clearly see the constellation Orion just off to the SSW.  I remember saying to myself, \"So clear, I\u2019ll bet I can see Taurus  (my Zodiacal sign).\"  Started to swing my head to the west and out of the corner of my eye, approaching from the south, I saw something I cannot explain. At least 9 amber/orange lights in formation and 3 or 4 more lights not in formation, meandering around the formation, were rapidly moving across the sky from almost due south to due north.  I was dumbfounded.  I observed this for about 15-20 seconds. The formation consisted of 3 v-shaped flights in a chevron that was rock solid, all flew in unison.  The meanderers seemed to circle and wander around the solid chevron as they tore across the sky at incredible speed. Flabbergasted, I muttered a few expletives.  Trying to get a grip on myself I struggled to get my phone out but just as it cleared my jacket pocket the phenomenon disappeared over the horizon to the north. I looked around to see if anyone else in the park saw this.  There was nobody around except Gadget who, sensing my astonishment, looked at me with concern as if to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, ((name deleteed))?  Why so frantic?\u201d  Completely blown away we stood there for a few moments.  I Goggled the number and called in the report to UFOReports.com right there from the park. Bewildered we walked home and I made an online report of the sighting. I tried to explain it to myself most of the rest of the night. Was it reflections of street lights off my glasses?  Their color was similar to sodium vapor street lighting.  No I surmised.  I had to swivel my head from south to north to track the lights and they never wavered in their flight path.  Arrow straight the formation flew, no wavering or smearing you would expect if it was a reflection. Space junk?  Maybe, but the formation was so solid the flight appeared to be on an intentional course.  And to have 9 lights in solid formation and 3 or for in a seemingly random formation is a mix of trajectories and not likely to be a single object that broke up on reentry.  Such junk would all follow the same path and would leave a trail of some sort.  There was no flaming trail. Aircraft?  I've never seen anything move that fast in the atmosphere.  I've seen satellites, the ISS, Skylab, these moved just as fast if not faster across the sky.  The meandering lights also seemed to take a non-ballistic course and moved in ways no aircraft I know of could reproduce. So, there you have it.

      "story": "Two very large objects reflecting the afternoon sunlight hanging just above the clouds in the sky west of Baltimore. It was the middle of the afternoon and I was driving eastward, when I glanced upwards to admire the beauty of the clouds which were lit up by the sun behind me.  That\u2019s when I noticed the first object, which was hanging just above the clouds and gleaming in the sunlight far more brightly than they were.  It was also angular, which made it stand out from the clouds. \tI noticed the second object, just like the first, a little farther beyond it.  They appeared to be stationary.  The clouds passing beneath them, they\u2019d reemerge in the same spot.  At one point a passenger jet passed below the clouds but still at some distance between me and the closer of these two objects, and then I realized how unbelievably large they must have been. \tThey seemed to be taller than they were wide.  And as I traveled round them, turning to the north, I saw their shape from another angle.  What appeared at first to be a box with a triangular projection below it became something like a very large \u201cX\u201d shape, with the upper legs being much taller than the bottom ones.  Then, viewed from the north, the side facing the sun appeared to be curved, almost like a sphere with a smaller sphere projecting below it. \tThey seemed to be hanging in the sky somewhere between White Marsh and the Aberdeen Proving Grounds northwest of Baltimore.  I was driving to New York, so eventually they were too far behind me to see anymore.",

Just wanted to confirm that as my sister described is exactly what i and brother recall and he believes he can narrow down the year after checking with parents.  I feel it is very similar to what other baltimore report saw.   I believe our parents called police and would have been one of those 200 calls that evening.  That night was clear and the saucer low and moved soundlessly and slowly.  You could make out the outter diameter outline as perfectly circular.  Not blimp shaped.  It had smaller diameter of a dozen or so lights on underside.  I remember thinking at the time how ironic that a ufo would look exactly like the underside of jupiter two of lost in space but i suppose the tv model is modelled after actual sitings.  This was early 70's suburban area.  No hot air balloon and no testing site for aircraft.  Never saw anything like it since even on tv shows showing debunked cases.

The objects were travelling in a tight, linear formation. Seemed to be about several hundred yards distance between each.  As the lead object approached a thin, wispy cloud it seemed to dissipate.  The second and third dissipated as well before reaching the cloud.  After a minute or two a single object appeared in the same location (again, with a trailing object) and quickly disappeared.

I looked for ground based lights shining upwards but found none.  As I continued to drive north through the city the lights remained in front & to the right and above my vehicle.  All the passengers in the car were watching the lights keenly and noted they appeared to be traveling with us. For several miles, traveling on city streets, and then on HWY 83 north through the city, the lights continued to dance above and to the right of my vehicle. 20 minutes after initially seeing the lights while driving, I parked on a hilltop to watch the lights. For an additional 25 minutes all occupants of my vehicle watched as the lights danced and pulsed brightly then faded, then getting bright again, all while dancing through the clouds.  We took a short video of the lights and several photos. The lights in total had a large circular shape, but the lights appeared to be moving in binary groupings. There were at least 20 individual lights, grouped into at least 10 pairings.  While parked the lights faded and the cloud appeared to grow dark grey in a large oval shape. The lights were very faint while I could see the grey outline.  It was getting late and the lights were distant and dimming and so we left the remarked sight to go to bed.

I thought it could have been a shooting star, until it sped at great speeds right over me, sometimes slowing down, in a zig-zag motion.   Then, when it was around 2/3 of the sky, I heard a VERY loud sonic boom, followed by an explainable sound.  It was like a plane, but higher pitched, mixed in with a siren.  It quickly disappeared in seconds.  Clearly, it was traveling at extreme speeds, and only about a few miles above the ground.  This happened around Baltimore.

At first, I thought it was a star, an incoming plane, or a helicopter flying over the city, but the light isn't moving.  The light resembles a star, but way bigger.   As it begins to dawn, the light is becoming dimmer, but it is still there.  It does not appear to be moving.  Perhaps it moved up, higher in the sky, but it's difficult to tell.  Even the binoculars aren't helping much.  The light is still in the sky (5:15). (NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in E sky?

      "story": "Multiple colored dome shaped UFO that sparkled. I believe it was back in 1970 that my brother and some of our neighbors saw a colorful flying object that had multiple colored lights around it and a sparkle effect to it...almost like a sparkler.  We could even here the sound coming from it.   It hovering above us and came close to some of the telephone poles.  It moved it such a peculiar way, sweeping back and forth in the sky.  We reported this to one of my neighbor's parents, but they concluded that it was just a weather balloon.   At that time I was very naive, but to this day I don't believe it could have been a weather balloon.  If anyone else has seen this during that time period please let me know.   I heard that someone from Chestnut Ridge, Pa, area had a similar experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

I noticed it from my bedroom apartment building window, then I went up to the rooftop to see it as clearly as possible it ws extremely small from my vantage point but it ws like a star in the sky but it wasn't ... I look out this window every day and I am well aware of the positioning of the stars from my window ... at night but it was bright and beautiful weather and sunny... it started moving slowly then it would drift down slightly as if it were a balloon but it wasn't I am one HUNDRED Percent SURE !!! then it would drift up ward and stay put!!!! And I tryied to video and take pictures because people are so fickle nobody believes things of this sort but I wasn't seeing things that's for sure ... a plane would fly pass it and it would drift as if it was falling out of the ski then once the plane was pasted it would drift upwards as it it were going backwards in no particular direction but far off ... I did capture as much as I could I am still in awe of it I! had been waiting to see a UFO for as long as I can remember but looking upwards all the time isn't something a person in the city does that often if at all ... I wanted to share this because it intrepid and scary yet fascinating all at the same time",

      "story": "Slow moving round object in the sky, rotating slowly and heading north. I was in my back-yard working in the yard, around 3pm on Friday Aug 24, 2018, when I heard a helicopter fly above, and looked up.  To the right of the helicopter (helicopter was heading west) I saw a round object moving slowly thru the sky heading north.  The helicopter didn\u2019t appear to be chasing it, as it just flew by and kept going west (though quickly fell behind the house/tree line so I don\u2019t know if it turned back towards the object while out of my view.)  Very rough guess, but comparing to the helicopter that was at about 1000 feet, it had to be comparable in size to the helicopter, maybe slightly bigger.  I live near an airport, and see helicopters a lot, this was just an average size common helicopter.  (local news and police take off from there, and it just looked like the standard news or police copter, nothing military).  This airport is a Maryland National Guard base as well though (in Middle River Maryland.)  The object was slowly moving to the north, while slowly rotating.  Would say approximately 1500 to 2000 feet in the sky.  It was circular in shape, but if you think of it as a burger, it was round with a small bite taken out of it.  As it rotated, the side without the \u201cbite\u201d, it was reflecting a lot of sunlight off the top of the object.  As it rotated the \u201cbite\u201d toward me, it was reflecting much less sunlight.  That was how I could really tell it was a spinning object, but indented on one side (i.e. the bite).  It seemed to make a full rotation every 10 to 15 seconds.  I could not take my eyes off of it, kept trying to rationalize what I was seeing.  After 2 or 3 mins, it finally dawned on me to pull out my phone and record some video.  With the bright sunny day, I was having a hard time seeing my phone\u2019s screen.  By the time I adjusted the screen brightness, got my camera app open and looked up, it was gone.  With how slow it was moving, I would have expected it to still be there.  I\u2019m so upset I did not take out my phone sooner.  It had to have moved quickly out of view, I would say it took me about 30 \u2013 40 seconds to get my screen brightness adjusted, and get the camera app open, and look back up.  It could not have been a plane, it was moving far too slowly.  A plane would have fallen from the sky at that slow of speed.  I did not see any helicopter blades on top, no wings, nothing.  Just a round spinning object, indented on one side.  Feel free to email me at address I left in the report, I'll answer any other questions I can.",
