The time was 2:24 PM CDT, the sky was unusually clear, and the wind was from the NNE. I had an unobstructed view of the sky. Looking to the NNE, I saw something approaching in the sky, about 20 degrees above the horizon, that I thought was a piece of paper blowing in the wind. It was bright white. I noticed what I thought was a jet and contrail behind it in the far distance when I first saw it, but could not resolve it.  It did not tumble, except once or twice it dimmed as if it might be tumbling. I thought it might be a bird, but it was clearly not acting like a bird, in that it was not dimming and brightening regularly like a bird would do flapping its wings. It seemed to be simply blowing in the wind. Fortunately, I had a camera, and took some pictures of it. The photos do not clear up what it is, however. It moved overhead and I lost it in the sun. I only saw it for a couple of minutes. It appeared to be far up, at least 2000 feet. I also took a photo of a jet with the same camera settings for comparison.",

At approximately 7:45 PM (19:45 hrs.) on the afternoon of August 31st, 2007 my wife and I walked out into our back yard.  As we were standing there I looked up into the sky and saw a rather bright glowing object in the sky.  I at first thought it was one of the planets, but realized it was still too early and not yet dark enough to see any stars.  I told my wife I thought it was something reflecting light from the sun but it was stationary and rather large.  I told her I thought maybe it might be the International Space station but I frankly do not know if that is ever visible to the naked eye.  I just sensed it was unusual so I went into the house to retrieve a pair of binoculars. I returned to the backyard and looked up at the object and could see then what looked like red glowing lights around the bright center circular object.  We could also see a jetliner moving through the sky and it too was reflecting some light.   My wife looked at the object through the binoculars also but did not try to adjust the lenses to her eyes and did not see the detail I did.  She said she could only see that it was a bright object.  This is when it got very interesting.  I got the binoculars back from her and as I was looking at object I saw approximately six smaller bright looking circular lights move away from  the brighter object we had first seen.  They moved away slowly from the center object at first and paused in a pattern around it.  They then suddenly took off at high speed and simply disappeared from view.  The center glowing object disappeared also.  As I was telling my wife what I was seeing she looked back only to see the original object was gone and the sky was now empty in the area.  I can\u2019t say these objects were craft but I saw what I just described and have no logical explanation for it.",

      "story": "Horizontal row of lights seen from a bridge over the Arkansas river, which changed configuration to a vertical column and disappeared I was driving on I-430 northbound across the bridge over the Arkansas river when I noticed a horizontal group of lights several hundred, perhaps as much as two thousand, feet in the sky above some trees on the right side (relative to the freeway I was driving on) of the northern coast.  All the lights were the same color, a bright white with a tinge of yellow.  They were four or five circular-shaped lights very close together so they almost appeared as one bar of light.  None of the lights blinked or changed color.  I was watching it for a little less than a minute when suddenly all the lights disappeared and a new set appeared in a vertical formation, bisecting the horizontal set of lights if they had remained visible.  The change occurred while I was watching and there was no smooth transition: the horizontal lights simply disappeared as the vertical lights appeared.  The vertical lights were the same color, intensity, and spacing as the horizontal lights, with each light just far enough apart from the next that they did not appear to be a solid bar of light like a fluorescent or neon tube.  Shortly after the vertical lights appeared, within a second or two, the top light quickly became much brighter.  A few seconds later, the vertical lights disappeared leaving only blackness.  The vertical lights were only visible for about five seconds before disappearing.  The entire time the lights were visible, just over a minute, they were completely stationary.  Had the lights been on at the same time, they would have resembled a cross (+).  There's no way the lights could have been attached to a radio tower or any other antenna.  I've made the same commute from Little Rock to Jacksonville almost every night for several years and am very familiar with all stationary land beacons.  Partially due to my familiarity with the drive and the fact that the bridge across the river is completely straight, I could devote a lot of attention to the lights.  It was too dark to make out a shape of whatever the lights were attached to.  Unfortunately, the night was too black and the lights too bright for me to make out any kind of shape the lights may have been attached to.  I never heard any sounds from the lights as I was driving on the freeway around 65 Mph in a cheap, poorly sealed car.  Because of this, it was impossible for me to conclude if the lights made any sound at all.  Note that for number of craft seen, I've selected 1-10: as few as one if the lights were all connected to one craft, and as many as 10 if each light was attached to its own craft.  I remain unsure of if there were four or five lights comprising the horizontal row and vertical column as I could barely make out the shape of each light.  However, I'm positive one of the numbers is correct.",

The orbs went behind a tree and I ran to the end of my yard, and watched the orbs gain speed and height, until they were out if sight.  This sighting could not be mistaken for any manmade craft that we have. Their was no sound at all.  The orbs did not shine any light on the trees.  One other weird thing.

      "story": "Triangular arrangements of lights appearing to begin to land on freeway, miltary-ish cars mobilze around it First of all, the documentary that is out there about Belgium sightings in 1991 - the depictions on that show are exactly what I saw. I was driving home from work from Little Rock to conway in normal evening traffic.  It was dark.  I was driving north on a 4 lane hwy with a large grass median in between and up ahead of me there appeared to be a 747 (my impression) coming towards me about to land on the freeway.  What I saw was a triangular arrangement of lights covering the expanse of the freeway slowly floating down towards the road, about half a mile ahead.  My impression was this was a landing aircraft with its nose in the air, coming directly towards me.  As it got closer it moved off to the side of the road and as I crossed the Arkansas river, it had stopped over the dam to my right and was just sitting there.  All I could see was three bright lights that weren't really illuminating anything.  About this time, all these cars around me lit up with these strange red lights in their dashboards - they didn't go round and round like a normal emergency light, they went side to side, were all red, and were i! n MANY cars ( don't know an exact number ) coming the other way and even driving right next to me, in front of me and behind me.  They all sped off the freeway on the dam exit towards where this thing was floating, probably ten cars in total.  Before the red lights turned on, on these cars, I had slowed down and rolled the windows down and couldn't hear a thing coming from whatever this thing was. I never heard a word about it from anyone, not in the news or television.  Years later I was watching a Discover channel UFO special about events in Belgium in 1989-1991 and there it was, exactly what I saw.  Granted, I never saw a distinct outline but if they said all this happened the night I saw what I saw, I would say, &quot;I saw that too&quot;.",

      "story": "Large white spiraling light traveling at incredible speed I was driving west on Lindsey Rd. at 1:01 A.M. after getting off of work.  In the curve of the road, right around the FedEx facility, I saw something out my driver's side window, at about 45 degrees south/southwest.  It was a fairly large, super-intense white light, circular in shape, moving at an incredible speed, coming from the northwest and moving southeast.  When people count by saying \"1 Mississippi\", this would have been more like \"1 M\" in duration.  The best way I can describe the object is, it looked like a rotating, flat spiral of white light.  In the dimmer arms of the spiral I may have detected a very faint yellow.  Picture the rotating spiral of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo'.  The location I saw this object in is immediately south of Little Rock Airport  (Clinton Airport).  I checked the flight schedules when I got home, and while departures were not listed, the last arrival was at least a couple of hours before my sighting.  This is not an airport that has much late night airplane activity.  I also looked up types of commercial aircraft lights when I got home, but didn't see anything similar to what I had seen.  I do know that Little Rock Air Force Base does practice maneuvers using Little Rock Airport runways and airspace, but they are a C-130 base.  The object I saw was at least as fast as a jet fighter, if not faster.  Obviously LRAFB could have jets from other places on occasion, but I don't know.  If this object came from the airport, it seems it would have been departing based on its direction of travel. I don't rule out any possibility.  I just would really like to know what I saw.  I have never in my life experienced or seen anything like that.  I have traveled this road for the past eight years. An investigator may contact me at my subitted email address.",

      "story": "Never have seen anything like it before...or since. My dad and I were on our way home from watching a movie in Little Rock.  It was dark, and the stars were bright.  We were driving on Hwy 10 (Cantrell Rd) and were coming up on our turn.  And, then we saw it. It had a circular shape, and there were three lights on the bottom that pointed down (the primary colors) moving in some sort of a pattern.  Around the edge of it there were lights that moved counter to the pattern and direction of the big lights.  All it did was hover above the house at the intersection of Hwy 10 and Ferndale Cutoff Rd.  It continued to hover for about 5 seconds as we slowed to a stop. Our stopping must have startled it, as it then stopped the colored lights pattern and very quickly took off. It took off and was going faster than my dad's 1978 Cadillac Coup Deville could muster.  He told me to buckle my seat belt as he buried the needle until it was no longer visible. And then it stopped.  It stopped so amazingly accurate and sudden that we couldn't do anything but shoot past where it had stopped and was hovering.  We turned around and were now headed back towards Little Rock.  It flew and flew and we all but lost sight of it until when it changed its path and flew upwards at a swooping 45\u00b0 angle and was gone. We drove home in silence.  That was 30 years ago.  My dad and I have talked about that experience one time only since.  By the way...that house had been demolished or something as it's now longer there.

I was in my yard and it was dark, I saw something in back of tree line moving slowing, coming from the North.  It came to a stop in a clear area close to where I was, had 3 large lights underneath, I believe.  It hovered approximately 3 minutes and then made a slight angle and went a different direction.  It seemed stopped at the edge of our property.  Very strange.  It was not a 'perfect' triangle, the back edge of the triangle seemed to have some indentations (it was hard to see as it was dark outside).  It then flew East more quickly down the edge of our property and turned to right (South).  I watched it behind tall pine and oak trees in our 20 acres of land.  It then seemed to turn East and I could see no longer.  It did not make any noise.   I have never seen anything like it in my life.  It seemed quite large and near the top of pine trees on our property. I don't think it was military vehicle. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

For quite a while it seemed to be an unfamiliar constellation...very high in the sky. Over the days it has become more and more visible. Tonight 5/28/2018, at approx 8:25 it was very low in the sky when it suddenly began to drop straight to the ground without making a sound. I happened to be looking at it when this took place. I was completely speechless and unable to call out to my friends. When it was higher it seemed more Christmas tree shaped wih several big lights or craft at each corner and in between points. Tonight as it fell the shape was completely visible. Cone shaped top then straight sides with numerous lights or craft. There was complete silence as it fell. It seemed to be extremely close to us. As it fell past the trees I could no longer see it. I had no was of getting to it so I immediately googled for similar sightings. I expect to hear something on the news tonight. I can't describe my feelings. Whatever it was has been one of the most amazing, overwhelming things that I've witnessed in my life. I hope to see more recent sightings here. the sightings in Mena AR and Fort Smith sound very similar. CC N",
