We had heard a light buzzing sound and turned around to see a craft with orangeish colored lights, hovering less than 20 yards from us.  That is all any of the three of us remember and in fact we didn't talk about it for almost ten years, like it had been teporarily erased from our memories, until one night when someone brought up UFO's and the three of us spoke up about our experience.  How could someone put something like that into the back of their brains.  After talking about it for awhile, none of us recalled the craft leaving and we believe that we may have lost some time.

The reason I thought that was because the light given off was a golden or light orange color.  Then I realized the figure was up higher and moving faster.  I thought it was a plane but it had no blinking red or green lights.  By this time my friend was looking on.  We both notice how fast it was moving though it was not streaking. My freind said it looked like it had a bar of lights on the underneath side of the craft.  I would resemble it to a flying wing that was completely illuminated on the underside with its lights having partioning lines between them. It appeared so large at first that I thought it could have been an owl perhaps 50 yards away illuminated by street lights.  This thing just kept on going and was out of site much more quickly than a plane that stared out looking that big. The direction it was flying in was southwest.  It disappeared within a span of 15 seconds. Again, it appeared to have the shape of a flying wing or just a bank of lights like a somewhat rectangular thing flying with the wide side forward.

It can\u2019t be a blimp or a signs pulled by and aircraft.  This was strange. When you took a longer look it was about 100 even more lights all crammed together very closely moving in a straight line in the same direction.  This was not a short line though! This line of lights in the sky was pretty long.  I would say about 10 ft long??  It might be the wrong measurement. My father thought that maybe it was a mother ship because the lights looked like the ones from the movies we watch.  My mother came when the long line of light reached its end.  So she saw about 10 lights all moving together before they disappea! red in the night sky.   This was a very unexplainable event and very scary one as well.

      "story": "Meteor-like objects with a mind of their own. Around 8:50-8:55 there were LOTS of lights falling from the sky. I was driving with my fianc\u00e9 from Cottonwood to Mesa, and I believe I was on the 101, traveling south, somewhere between the 51, and the 202. I noticed the first, and brightest, of all of the objects, and quickly woke my fianc\u00e9 so that he could see it as well. At first, it looked like a huge falling star/firework (bright flaming rock with a sparkling tail), but it lasted a really long time (around 20 seconds), and it\u2019s flight pattern was weird. It was falling straight down for about 6 seconds, then shot right back up (2-3 seconds), fell down again in a zigzag pattern (2-3 seconds), shot straight up again (2-3 seconds), then made a hard right turn in the middle of the sky and travelled a little ways (about 3-4 seconds) before burning out. I told my fianc\u00e9 to grab his phone and start filming, and he tried but said that the camera wasn\u2019t picking them up very well, but I kept insisting that he try. Seconds after the first light disappeared, it was followed by another similar light that originated out of nowhere, high in the sky, but must have been at least 3 miles apart as the crow flies. Then another one appeared in the opposite direction.  Then another miles apart, and so on. No rhyme or reason to where they appeared.  There must have been at least six of these lights  back to back, and all popping up in random places, miles apart. . Meanwhile, there were LOTS of planes/jets that looked like they were circling the area. At first (for a very brief second), I was thinking that maybe they were some sort of flare\u2026 but flares last for a while (about 5-10 minutes), and hover in one place before burning out. I\u2019ve seen plenty of flares from the Gila Bend Air Force while living in Ajo, and those flares are completely different than the lights that we saw.  Even the colors differ. The last one was really strange. It dropped down SUPER low (about fifty feet above some houses), and then, before hitting the ground, it leveled out, turned right, and coasted above the houses for a few seconds until it fizzled out. That would have been the perfect one to catch on camera, but unfortunately, when my fianc\u00e9 tried to view the video afterwards, he realized he hadn\u2019t been filming whatsoever. I did some research, and there were similar reports in Florida the day before, and they were saying that it could possibly be remnants of a Chinese rocket\u2026  But since when did remnants have a mind of their own and move up, down, and sideways?

I was near Union Hills Rd and Tatum Blvd, I parked my car in front of a house facing east and when I got out of my driver\u2019s side,  I looked due North/Northwest and saw a diagonal string of 3 lights very low in the sky, with a fourth light further along the string with some space in between the 4th light and the other 3, as my video clearly depicts. I was in a hurry dropping something off and assumed they were planes, but when ingot back to my car, before I drove off I took a quick video of it because I thought wow you don\u2019t usually see planes or aerial activity in this vicinity, since I was well north of Sky Harbor Airport by some 12 miles and these lights were well North of Scottsdale airport which would\u2019ve been about 7-8 miles east of my location.  I saw a plane off in the distance but was pretty far away from the lights. Even though I didn\u2019t look at them for very long, considering the time I looked upon parking my car as well as looking at them when I got back in my car to depart, the lights didn\u2019t move.  They might\u2019ve been flares but they were definitely white in color and shined and how a glare/glow to them, unlike the 1997 Phoenix Lights that didn\u2019t glare or produce a corona.  There was no sound but I was very far away, maybe 3-4 miles. The 3 lights were very low in the sky, I cannot estimate how low but trees were blocking my vantage point.  And single light that was highest in the sky was maybe 5-10k fest high (?), hard to estimate.  Please refer to my video, sorry it is so short.",

I work in the airline industry and have spent many nights on the ramp.  I know airplane landing light formations for just about every type of aircraft.  This was no aircraft.   The second event were flares dropped over the Gila mountains.  They acted exactly like flaires and it is my opinion that they were dropped to confuse everyone from the first event.  I lived in Phoenix for 10 plus years and never were flares dropped from that position at night.   Sky Harbor is not far away and never once were flares dropped at night.  It would freak the passengers out if they saw something like that while landing.  Even the Marines in Yuma draw attention if they practice at night.  Flying in the Southwest between California and Arizona, you can easily see night activity from far away.  Just as soon keep my name to myself.  Just found your site and wanted to share what I know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  We agree with his assessment about the flares.  NUFORC has long argued that the flares, which occurred at approximately 22:00 hrs., occurred after the genuine UFO event had ended, which occurred at approximately 21:45 hrs..  PD))",

It was sometime between 7:30 and 8:30 P.M..  My recliner seat in my jacuzzi at that time faced the north.  I could see planes coming in from the northwest every couple of minutes which I assume were coming in from Las Vegas and they still fly that same pattern today.  As I was looking what would be due north I notice 5 lights heading straight this way as if they were following I-17.  I was thinking I was going to see maybe the concord. The lights were not real high off the horizon when I noticed them.  I set an watched them coming in anticipation to see what they are.  At a distance they looked like they were in a straight line.  As they got closer they gained in altitude gradually and I could see a V formation.  There is a tree in the lot behind my house that they went behind for just a few seconds.  When they got on the south side of the tree I was amazed at how they had even gotten higher in the sky.  The lights never broke there V formation.  I could see that this was one object of an enormous size.  The lights flew directly over Phoenix while gaining altitude at an accerlerated speed.  I watch the lights along with my Mom and cousin Katy.  As the lights gained in speed and altitude the craft made a straight angle turn with no curve in its turn.  It was simply amazing.  I have seen footage over the years and only one  video showed the same object or one similiar to what we seen.  The lights that supposedly appeared down in south phoenix I do believe were flares.  The object I witnessed was flying and had no sound at all.  It is way to big for any aircraft that we as the general public no of.  I do not know much about the other lights in south phoenix but I wish they would debunk them and focus on the huge craft that actually flew from the north and over the city of phoenix.  I saw the video of the lights that were over Phoenix last night[4/22/08.  At first they resembled the lights I saw however the front light was not there and that video showed the lights moving towards and away from each other so I know it was not the same object I saw in 1997.  The object I witnessed had \"fixed\" lights on it and they looked the same in roundness from any direction you looked at them.  When I was a kid my brother and I have one other sighting I would like to talk or write about but at this time I would like to know more about the object that flew over ! Phoenix.",

Location: Observed from side street near major intersection of 43rd Ave. and Peoria Ave. Sighted multiple objects flying in formation, first noticed in SSE position moving south to north. Objects had a slight tan, copper toned color, which I at first thought might be the reflection of city streetlights. As they approached closer, nearly overhead, they appear uniform in color and seemed to be illuminated with a glow similar to Christmastime luminaria (candles placed in brown paper sacks or bags).  I could not tell the altitude of the objects.  They were moving due north in a wide \u201cV\u201d formation.  There were about ten objects in each arm of the \u201cV\u201d all the same rectangular (shaped like a postage stamp, slightly longer in the north-south dimension, the direction of travel).  Meantime, a commercial airliner was climbing out on a NE heading as if it were heading for Denver (very noisy) to my left that would place it over the far northwest area of Glendale, probably over 67th Ave. and Bell Rd. or slightly farther north, possibly over 67th Ave. and Union Hills Rd.  I was riding a bicycle on a dark side street facing east.  As I recall, the evening was clear and moonless.  I figured that the \u201cV\u201d formation would cross the path of the jet airliner and I would be able to get an idea of the altitude and size of the objects as they intersected with the airliner.  As the \u201cV\u201d formation approached overhead, slightly to the east, if low, possibly traveling above 35th Avenue. If higher, they possibly would be above Black Canyon Freeway (I-17), over the Metrocenter regional shopping mall.  The \u201cV\u201d formation was not directly overhead, but slightly to the east of me at an undetermined altitude. As I watched the \u201cV\u201d formation approach the point directly east of me, the objects did a coordinated maneuver: They moved out along the \u201cV\u201d and spun in a coordinated circular pattern and then moved close together in a circular group packed tightly but none of them overlapping.  They moved out of the \u201cV\u201d formation in opposite directions and formed two separated circular clusters.  In doing this complicated maneuver, they never changed speed or their north-south orientation.  The motion out of the \u201cV\u201d formation reminded me of the Paramount logo at the start of Hollywood movies where the star flow up an around the mountain forming a circle of stars. This happened out of the arms of the \u201cV\u201d forming a rotating circle of rectangular objects that then tightened the circle into a paced grouping also having a roughly circular perimeter with all the objects maintaining their north-south direction only now formed into two separate circular tightly packed cluster \u2013 still moving toward the jet airliner.  The separation between the two clusters was approximately the length of the ends of the \u201cV\u201d when I first saw it and when it reached the point direct east of me..  These objects continued moving due north and at some point would intersect the path of the jet airliner \u2013 either In front of it or behind it \u2013 at least one or the other of the now two separate circular tightly packed clusters.  The jet airliner continued NE.  The two clusters were moving toward the rear quarter of the plane and I was sure one of the cluster would intersect and pass over the plane either above it or below it and that would give me some idea of their relative size and altitude.  As the two clusters moved toward the rear quarter of the plane, probably at about a 45 degree angle if a passenger on the plane were looking back over the plane\u2019s horizontal tail assembly.  As both clusters approached the plane and reached a point fairly close, both clusters simultaneously blinked invisible \u2013 as if the simultaneously and instantly turned on some kind of \u201ccloaking\u201d effect that rendered them invisible.  Neither cluster passed over or under the plane.  They just suddenly turned invisible.  The jet airliner continued it NE heading, the pilot or crew or passengers, unaware that a large cluster of rectangular objects had nearly intercepted it.  When I arrived home, about a half mile from where this sighting occurred, I looked in the White Pages and found two listings for UFO reporting.  The first one I called rang with no answer.  The second one I called, UFO Watch I think was the name, located in Fountain Hills east of Scottsdale.  The man I talked to said it was extremely unusual to see rectangular objects and even more unusual to see multiple rectangular objects.  He said the complex coordinated maneuvers I described the objects performing would not be possible from any current technology he was aware of.  The U.S. Air Force didn\u2019t have anything capable of such a complicated, coordinated maneuver and they certainly would not perform something as complicated as the circular spin and tight formation clustering over a densely populated city such as Phoenix.  He told me to make a note of what I had seen and leave it at that.  He said no one would believe me.  I told him that I had two thoughts.  One was that this was the first UFO sighting I had ever experienced and couldn\u2019t believe that it occurred over a metropolitan area.  I thought UFO sightings usually were seen over remote, rural areas.  And second, that this occurred in the early evening and surely I wasn\u2019t the only one who had witnessed it.  People would be out playing tennis or shooting baskets or doing other outdoor activities and would have seen the same \u201cV\u201d formation and the maneuvers that I had seen.  I watched the news the next couple of days and never heard any report of such a sighting or similar UFO report.  I find it hard to believe that I was the only one who witnessed this unusual event.  There was a different sighting reported over Phoenix of some kind of unusual \u201clights\u201d but they were moving in the opposite direction, from what I have heard, moving from north to south.  I told the man in Fountain Hills that I was sure that if I went out and purchased some video or photography equipment that it was unlikely that I would encounter such an unusual display of UFO mass coordinated maneuvers in the rest of my lifetime.  I probably would be wasting my time expecting to see such a sighting again and hoping to record it on videotape or on photographic film.  But what I had witnessed spanned about ten minutes at the most, maybe not that long.  The objects were not moving very fast, no faster than the jet airliner.  If I move my hand to trace the movement of the objects, the time lapse is more like one or two minutes, possibly less than one minute.  When I first saw the \u201cV\u201d formation, it was about halfway between the hor! izon to the SE and zenith looking due East.  This is the first time I have ever given a written report of that sighting.  I have told family and friends what I saw.  Each time a movie started showing the Paramount Pictures-Gulf & Western stars spinning in a circle, I would mention that\u2019s what I saw those UFO objects do as they moved out of the \u201cV\u201d formation.

There were 4 Points of light, White and they maintained no consistant shape or formation. They occasionaly blinked and moved. Then each one \"winked out\". And were gone.. The Report was fresh, So Details are yet to be reported, Reguarding: Movement,Direction(s),Color Variations, Behaviour(s) and any Related Anomilies ect.  Being a Native of Phoenix for 48+ years, I can attest that Peculiar Lights are... On, Or just above the Mountains around the valley fairly often.

The lights would position themselves like squares, triangles and even straight lines. The lights were visible for about 30 minutes and would move side to side fast. The local air ports and Luke Air Force Base said they had no planes on radar. The last time lights were seen like this was the famous Pheonix Lights, when thousands of people seen several lights in a V formation about 11 years ago. The Air Force said they were only flares.",

      "story": "Rectangular Shaped 4 Red Lights Which All Blinked Out Within 18 Minutes At approximately 20:15, as I was taking out the trash, and walking back into my apartment, I glanced up at the sky, and saw a triangular shaped patter of 4 red lights, located in the Northwestern sky. At least one of the 4 lights was set slightly back from the others, making the triangle off just a tad. The lights were at the approximate height that any helicopter, or airplane getting ready to land or having just taken off would fly. There was absolutely no sound with the lights.  I walked back into my apartment to get my camera, thinking how odd that was. When I got back out, I almost did not expect the lights to still be there, but they were. It appeared as though the lights were moving very very slowly, because they had hardly moved at all. I attempted to take a picture, but was unable to get a good result.  At the same time I was trying to get the picture, two other people were walking to their car, and also saw the lights. Upon staring harder at the lights, it seemed as though they were moving very slowly in a Southeasterly direction. By this time, the 4 lights had formed a uniformed triangular shape.  As I watched, the furthest westerly light started blinking, and after a few seconds, blinked out. Then, the next light began blinking and also blinked out. Within seconds, the third light also began blinking, and then blinked out. By this time, the last remaining light had switched directions, and was now moving northeast.  As I watched the remaining light, there would be times that it would flash very brightly, and I caught a glimpse of a shape of something, but before I could define it, the light would grow dim again. It almost seemed, as if it were a rounded shape, like the nose of an airplane, but much larger. As I watched, the singular remaining light continued to move to the Northeast, and then it just stopped. It would still continue to blink brighter, allowing me to briefly make out the shape of something, but then it would grow dim again.  Within, 18 minutes of my first seeing the lights, the fourth and final light then blinked out. As I walked back into my apartment, I suddenly got chills, as if I had just seen or experienced something extremely important.  In the past, I have seen other strange sightings, including something similar a few months where there were three lights also in a loose triangular pattern. All three of those lights eventually blinked out as well.",

One reminded me of a cassette tape turned on its side; rectangular with an even row of what looked like square holes or dark rectangles. The next one was very round and was the same color as the one before it. The next was harder to see, as it was further away, but it appeared to be the same as the first one, only slightly shimmering (possibly due to vantage point and shimmering city lights?). After quickly arriving at my destination, I parked the car and asked my friend if she could see what I saw.

My mom and I took a trip out to Phoenix to pick up our dogs from her boyfriend at the time.  I was outside playing in the apartment complex with a bunch of other kids.  This craft of some sort came out from behind the left side of the apartment building.  It was hovering low but it made no sound.  It moved super slow and seemed to be there forever.  Long enough for all of us kids to go get our parents and they were standing out there looking at it too.  I don\u2019t remember if I walked closer to look at it but it seemed to me that if I had stood on the block wall that circled that apartment complex I could have touched it.  I think it had lights that went around the edge of it.  I don\u2019t remember what shape it was just that it was dark and like nothing I had ever seen before.  I don\u2019t remember feeling afraid or in danger.  I can\u2019t even remember it going away or if it was there so long that I lost interest. I remember everyone who was standing in the driveway looking at it was very calm, very quiet and I don\u2019t remember ever discussing it with anyone until recently.  My mom even remembers it.  I would love to know if anyone in Phoenix at that time saw that same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I became exited and intrigued about my coincidential UFOs sighting; thus I started to keep a watchful eye more frequently on the skies.  Also, since my first sighting happened at 3pm during the day, I only watch the sky during the day; not having the need to watch at night, since night observations make easier to confuse ordinary lights with UFOs. ******** SUNDAY NOVEMBER 19, 2006 ********** Still excited about the sighting on the previus day; while my wife and daughter went to church, I stayed home, I went to the backyard around 1pm, at the beginning I didn't see anything, but after 10 minutes of watching, I could see a white spec to the North at 80\u00b0, after a little while it became more visible since it descended more becoming a metallic sphere, the altitude was higher than the flight of a commercial airline plane.  The sphere travelled for 3 minutes Southbound until it dissapeard and it was reflecting the sunligh in flicks giving the impression of being a rotating object... ********* THURSDAY NOVEMBER 23, 2006 ******** We went to Tucson, AZ to spend Thanksgiving with relatives... We arrived to Tucson on Wednesday night, and on Thursday around noon while the Turkey was being prepared I went outside to my relatives' backyard; The house is located in South Tucson close to Irvington Road and Benson Highway... The day was a nice with some light clouds on the skies; and again after watching for a while, I was facing Southwest and I saw this bright metallinc, aluminum like, sphere coming down slowly from the clouds at 60\u00b0; I called my cousin's boyfriend and he put his sunglasses on and we could see the UFO flying high from Southwest to Northeast towards the Catalina mountains until it dissapeared without descending.  We could see this object for around three minutes and again, it appeared to have a rotating motion, since the sunligth w! ould ref lect on its body and flicker once in a while.  ********* SUNDAY DECEMBER 10, 2006 **********  I was in my house, located in West Phoenix, watching TV.  I could hear a helicopter's noise flying low in the neighborhood; I came outside to the backyard, and noticed that the helicopter was two blocks East of my house; flying in circles; it was giving orders to someone on the ground thru the speakers; then I turn my sight Northeast at 75\u00b0 and saw this metallic sphere stationary way up there, I went inside to get my wife, but she didn't want to come out, because she's tired of me looking for UFOs; when I came outside again, the spehere was not in there anymore, then I turned North-Northwest and I found it at a much lower altitude at 45\u00b0, and I definitely could appreciate an oval shape and reflecting sunlight, I ran inside the house to get a videocamera; a cheap Panasonic Mini DV53, when I came outside the UFO wasn't in there anymore and the helicopter had moved four blocks south of my house and it still was flying in circles.  I look around for a while, and turned my head up 90\u00b0, and there it was right above me.  I tried to focuse it with the videocamera but it wasn't in there anymore; I looked for it and I found it East at 75\u00b0 and it had ascended; I wasn't able to get a shot of it, but it definitely was in there; I finally got tired and went back into the house; The event lasted at least 10 minutes....  ********* WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 13, 2006 *********   I went to pick up my 6 years old daughter at school, she gets released at 2:40pm, I always get there 10 to 15 minutes early, and while I wait for her, I scan the skies looking for \"my friends\", it was a nice day, sunny with a few light clouds, at 2:39pm, I noticed the metallic sphere appear East-Northeast at 75\u00b0; there's always a bunch of people picking up theird kids, and I watch around to see if anyone notices what I'm watching; noone is watching, I assume noone is into this, noone would care.  The UFO travelled right above us as I picked my daughter, it took ! around t wo minutes since it appeared and dissapeared on its path...  ******** SUNDAY DECEMBER 16, 2006 ********** My brother and his family came to visit, it's been over a month since I've been watching the skies looking and spotting UFOs, and he's not aware of my activity yet...  He needed some tools because he was going to do some work on his car; I was on the driveway getting tools out of my car; I noticed the UFO East at 80\u00b0, my brother came out, then I tell him, about some events over the last month, he scratches his hair, by now the UFO has moved farther East and it's visible at 45\u00b0 over my neighbors tree. I didn't tell him about it, and then he spot it, and he asked \"Like that one?\". I just smiled and replied to him, \"Yes, just like that one\". ******** I must disclose that since the first sighting I've watch similar UFOs in at least 9 different times; however, since the time my brother saw that one, I'm not able to see one more sighting.  Also, I've been able to find video of similar sightings...  check them and judge for yourselves....

The lights were in what I would describe as a random pattern.  We decided to take an exit off the interstate so we could get a better look.  I ended up on a service road heading north.  As I looked for a place to turn around I looked in my outside review mirror and noticed that suddenly all of the lights were in a perfect line!  We went about a mile down the service road, turned around and pulled over to the side and watched for a while.  One thing that we noticed when the lights were in a random group as well as when they were in a straight line, is that one or two would fade out, then slowly \"fade\" back into view.  It was a clear night (CAVU).  After about 10-15 minutes, they all \"went out\" in no particular order.  Later, on the evening news, they were reported as flares, as high as 10,000 ft.  Which raises some questions: Why would they be dropping flares that high (flares are used to light the ground.  At 10,000 ft. they wouldn't do any good) and if they were dropped from a plane, how did they manage to drop the first group of flares in such a random manner?  Also, why would some of them fade out then reappear?",

I was outside smoking on the east side of the building I work in when iI just happened to look up into the sky and saw a light that resembled the star Sirus in shape, size and color moving nort at a pretty slow speed, but then it quickly picked up speed dimming as it moved north across the sky.  The event lasted about 10 seconds!  It was was about 45 degrees high, due east and for about 3 or 4 seconds it was slowly moving north, it picked up speed pretty fast an it was also dimming rather fast as well.   It had just went into a thin stretch of clouds and I waited for it to reappear on thr other side but it never did.  Even a plane coming head on would not have the brightness that the object had and I stood outside an extra 5 minutes just to see if it ever cleared the clouds, it never did, it just vanished!  I'm an amateur astronomer and I know my stars pretty well, this was pretty high in the night sky and it appeared right in the vicinity of Mars on this date and time.

It  started moving in an a zig-zag fashion at that same slow rate of speed.  I told my wife that that is rather odd... we kept watching it for a minute or so and the light then came on solid, and started to pick up speed in a straight line fashion.  It hit what appeared to be airplane speed in a straight direction.  Then, it proceeded to start blinking in a strobe fashion and appeared to plummet towards the Earth.

We saw in front of us, what seemed to be a glow on the ground, at 2 o'clock from where we were positioned, and saw lights in the air, like balls of light, I'm not sure, but maybe 100 ft up in the air.  There were around six of them, perfectly aligned with the road.  I was pretty freaked out, and so was my husband.  I pulled into the last rest area before you hit Phoenix, and you could still see the lights. The lights looked as if they were stretched out for a couple miles or something. at the rest area, there were two we could distinctly see, I had my camera phone on me, and attempted to take pictures.  One, I believe came out, but the other did not. it just looked like a ball of light, nothing flashy.  After seeing photos of the Phoenix lights, I was amazed at how similar it was, but what I saw was slightly different.  6 lights in the air, one on the ground, (which was the first one we saw) and, these lights did not move, at all.  They stayed stationary, and then faded out.  I stayed at the rest area as long as I could, because I wanted to know if these light thingys moved.  I will be honest, I didn't see any movement.  I tried to look for some sort of form, and I did not see any.  I was looking for any clues besides it was a bright white light, so that I would have some definition to what I said once I confessed my report.  I am sorry for not coming forward sooner.

I had just turned onto 51st Ave from Indian School Road and had travel about 200 feet.  I had my radio on, and it was playing rather loudly.  Over the sound of the music, I thought I heard a \u2018pop\u2019 or a \u2018rumble\u2019, and looked up into the night sky.  It was dark and cloudy.  From behind me, up in the sky, a very bright green light shot through the sky, also going southbound, and traveled very far and very fast.  I have never seen anything move that fast.  This entire incident lasted less than two seconds.  I would estimate that it went as far as South Mountain before disappearing in the sky.  The green light was about the size of a dime coin if I was to hold it above me against the windshield, and did not get much smaller than that in overall size as it moved away from me.  There was no tail, no trailing smoke or anything one might associate with a meteorite.  It was not a solid ball of light; it had points of light, like a star in the sky.  It moved incredibly fast, in a straight line, it did not arc towards the earth; it remained elevated in the sky, and disappeared in the distance like a light going out. This was fascinating and beautiful to see.  It was incredibly fast, and from the distance that I estimate it traveled, I don\u2019t think we have anything publicly known that can travel that fast.  I believe other people in cars behind me saw this as well.  I suspect it was a meteorite, but it was just an awesome sight, and cannot explain the lack of an arc or a tail if it was.",

The moon was behind me so the light was reflecting off of the object.  I initially thought it was a paraglider, but it was not moving across the sky and there was no sound.  I called my wife out to the yard and she brought binoculars.  I used the binoculars to view the object, it looked like a a group of about 10-20 large white balloons (shaped like a parachute) with a cable pointing towards the ground.  It seemed to be pretty high in the sky, but as it was night I can not say exactly how high it was.  I watched the object for about twenty minutes, it moved slowly back and forth across the sky.  I then went into my front yard and walked up the street about 200 feet, the object was above me and off to the side.  I thought that maybe it was some kids playing a prank, flying an odd shaped kite in the sky at night, so I got in my car and drove to the park up the street.  I didn't see anyone at the park, but I did see some odd flashing lights on or beneath the playground equipment.  I didn't get out of my car so I don't know if there were people on the playground, but I definitely saw some flashing lights on the ground.  I then drove home, viewed the object from the front yard and then the back yard, and then went inside to quickly search the internet for images of weather balloons.  I went outside approximately 5 minutes later and the object was gone.  I awoke the next morning to my alarm clock, it wakes me up to KTAR 92.3 FM, a local talk radio station.  The very memory I have of that morning is listening to a quick story about some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership and a plane almost hit them, and then the announcer quickly moved on to the next story.  I felt like I was awake, but I can't say with 100% accuracy that I did not dream the story.  However, I do have a very clear memory of waking up to that news story.  I searched KTAR's homepage for the balloon story and also searched azcentral.com, but did not find any stories.  The nearest car dealership is about 8 miles away to the southwest.  I have thought of three explanations for what I saw.  The first is that it was someone playing a prank and flying an odd shaped kite or balloon high up in the sky on the night of the full moon.  The second explanation would be some large balloons that got loose from a car dealership.  The third explanation is that it was a UFO.  I doubt the second explanation just because the object was \"floating\" above my neighborhood for so long.",

      "story": "Triangle, lights, north Phoenix, AZ, spring 05 Ill state this to the best of my memory.  I was 20 working a pt night shift while in school in north phoenix. Nights are very nice there so i would sit out side for an hour after work. I had been sitting out side staring at the stars maybe seeing a shooting star once in a while. I was doing this for maybe 3 nights prior to seeing this, and was actually thinking how id like to see a ufo, and so i sat peacefully staring and pondering about et and life.  This is when it almost scared me because three stars(lights just dimmer than stars) started to move in unison, in a triangular shape(a triangle that was flat with the earth that distorted with distance) it was heading nw slowly. i tried not to blink because the glair from city lights there made it harder to see the farther it moved.  I was hoping to see it pass a star through the center of the object to determine if it was solid of not but never noticed it happen, just floated silently to disappear in the orange glow of the horizon.  I think i held my breath the entire time so event was very short  Also seen same lights in Colorado, so see my other report Ill file shortly. Ill call it Triangle, lights, front range ,CO, summer 05 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

All  four witnesses saw two round orange lights that would occasionally flicker red/ yellow flying in a horizontal linear formation. These lights flew in formation for about five minutes then the eastern most light(the one on the left) disappeared, followed shortly(perhaps 30 seconds) by the western light(Right side of formation). It is relatively clear out tonight, by that I mean you can see the outline of the surrounding mountain ranges. These lights were well above the summit of the southwestern ranges. We dont believe they disappeared behind them, they just left. Two witnesses saw a third light to the far north west that matched the description of the other two lights. This third light disappeared shortly before the other two. As far as background of the observers: one high school principle, a loan officer, a real estate agent and a local business owner.",

The white sphere had no blinking lights what so ever it was soild white and was alot brighter than the headlights on plane. I continued to watch as they crossed pathes with each other, I was not able to tell if they were at the same altitued because the sphere was just in fornt of plane. As the plane went past me I couldn't see the headlights any more but I could still see the bright sphere as if it was a ball of light. The object continued flying south into some thin clouds. When it got into the clouds they lit up all around it. Then it got into a thick cloud and I couldn't see it anymore , I stood there for a few more minutes waiting for it to come out the other side of the cloud, and it never did.",

Off to my left I noticed a disk shaped object moving very erratic from North to South just ahead of the gust front generated by the thunderstorm. I at first thought maybe it was a balloon or other debris but that couldn't be the case because this storm was moving basically to the West directly at me, and very slowly ! So any objects would have been heading straight towards me. This disk shaped object moving North to South was traveling very slowly, almost as if it were sightseeing. Lightning was very intense just east of my location so that ruled out any helicopters or private planes in the same area. That disk shaped object was much to low as seen in the photo to be commercial airliner, Sky Harbor international airport in Phoenix was almost 25 miles away. Shortly after this photo was taken it traveled slightly more to the south and lifted almost verticle into the scud clouds and never did reappear.",

We took a blanket with us to spread it on the grass.  There was a lot of people at the park, and we opted for a tree apart from the rest of the people.  After having lunch we laid on the blanket facing the blue clear sky.  I started scanning the sky for airplanes, and I noticed a small sphere way up there, too high, for a minute I thought it was a balloon; however, as I saw airplanes flying by, I noticed that the sphere was much higher than the airplanes.  The size of the airplanes was tiny, and I could still see the sphere, so it could not be a balloon.  The sphere was stationary for a minute then it started moving slowly North in a straight line, I told my wife about it and she was able to see it too... she said \"The air up there is dragging the balloon\"; however, after several seconds, the sphere reversed direction, now going South slowly.  I told her about it and she said \"Well the air changed course up there\".  As I kept looking the sphere going South, I noticed another sphere positioned much higher, my wife wasn't able to see it.  And I started to get excited, \"Those are not balloons I told her\".  The sphere going south reversed direction again, and this time it moved faster Northbound, as it was moving I look farther ahead of it and I could see another sphere at the same speed ahead of the firt one and I lost them in a couple of seconds.  I turn my eyes back looking for the sphere that I had noticed on a higher altitude, and I noticed that the sphere had come down because I could see it better. My wife was able to see it too.  I grabbed my digital camera and took a picture, when I moved the camera away the sphere was gone, when I got home and downloaded the picture, I only could see the blue sky.",

We tried to get a video camera from neighbors but could only find a pair of binouculars.  When we viewed the object through the binoculars, it appeared to be dark in color and somewhat amorphous in shape.  At times, depending on the angle, it looked like a black blob with a tail, like a tadpole.  Later, it appeared to look almost like the silouette of a bat, like something you would see at Halloween.  It also appeared to have something smaller trailing it.  I am not sure, but they may have been connected.

I thought that it was a balloon, but noticed that it seemed motionless.  I would guess that it was well above 5,000 feet in altitude.  The object was whitish/ silver and seemed to be the size of an airliner, but it was difficult to judge, since it was so high up and there was no other reference points in the clear blue sky.   This object stayed in the same location for about 3 minutes.  I was distracted briefly by a phone call and when I returned to the sky, I noticed that the object had disappeared.

It was a full moon and we simultaneouly saw a light appear, move and stop about 15,000 feet above downtown Phoenix.  The easiest way for me to explain its movement is to have you hold your extended arm straight out in front of you, then hold your thumb and index finger about four inches apart - that is how far this thing move in a second, after appearing out of nowhere. After acting like a satellite, it just stopped and hovered in the same spot for 20-30 minutes.  We had convinced ourselves that we imagined it before it moved about the same distance in downward and behind a desert tree. Before moving, two airplanes with navagational lights passed over the orb, and Phoenix at approx. 30,000 feet. The orb was a good 5 miles from us.  The round, glowing craft had colors \"scanning\" around it which reflected off what seemed like a mist around it. Two of the lights coming from the orb appeared to scan a wide swath around my friend and I. The first was a bluish color that was wide and tall, and it moved up and down. The second 'beam' was more focused and white, and it seemed to come directly nears us and scan through us in a sideways motion. Pink and red colors were also present in the overall rotational pattern.  About that same time, strange noises were coming from the brush on the other side of the cattle-guard, steel fence surrounding the house and pool area. The nearest house was two hundred yards away with open desert and tall brush between houses.  On two occasions, and in two different areas, I swore that I could see a blue glow that seemed to be coming from a specific point 100 yards into the brush.  The first noise was like a muffled duck call, very quiet and over and over again from different areas. Then the brush moved violently as though something ran through it in one area. Then crackling was heard in another area.  The other noise sounded like pieces of hard wood knocking together because something was moving around, or communicating from different areas of the brushy desert - multiple somethings moving around with them around their necks or something.  The hair was standing all over my body at that point. My friend concurred. I felt as though I was begin watched from outside the fence by something, much like an animal in the zoo must feel.  Then there was a flash (like a camera flash 100 yards away) and all the noise in the brush suddenly stopped. It was deadly quiet! Even the dog quit barking. We joked that the aliens took the dog (it barked again later).   I have since left my friend's house and have been watching the orb.  It is now 12:46 and on the move again. It has now moved two inches straight down and to the right since 12:11 (at least it is straight down the side of my window. By 12:55 it was five inches farther in same direction and then blocked out of my view by highway 202.  It looked like it was slowly going west across the city toward Buckeye when I lost it. ((NUFORC Note:  A sighting of a genuine UFO, which lasts for almost three hours in the vicinity of a major metropolitan area, is quite unusual.  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the planet, Jupiter, which is quite prominent in the southern sky, at present.  PD))",

UFO Report  Dear Sir;  I was just made aware of your reporting center from a television show narrated by Peter Jennings.   I appreciate your work.  I\u2019m sending you an ancient sighting report for one purpose:  You may be able to compare the description I give with similar ones, or it may stand out as a different one.  The event happened in approximately 1993 or 1994 in the summer.  My son, his girlfriend and myself were in the back yard of my house when the girlfriend said \u201cLook at that\u201d and pointed to a plastic shopping bag that had been kicked up by a gust of wind.  When I looked at the shopping bag my gaze was directed elsewhere and I saw 4 or 5 craft that I consider to be not only unidentified flying objects but non-Earthly flying craft.  The craft were gold in color and incandescent, glowing with their own light in the full sun, with no part of the craft shadowed.  The craft had no windows, flight controls or other appurtenances.  They were identical, about the size of a thumbnail on an outstretched hand, and were shaped very similar to a football with one exception:  The points of a football are centered between top and bottom, but in these craft the points were slightly lower than the center.  The craft maneuvered independently.  I\u2019m not sure of their number because they maneuvered in diverse directions and moved so fast I couldn\u2019t get a count of them.  I watched one in particular and observed it to move very fast, and to make sudden changes in direction, performance unlike any Earthly craft.  All of the craft were located to the south-southwest of my position.  The one I watched most intently moved to just about due west of me and then changed direction suddenly and went back to the south.  All manuevers observed occurred in clear sky with no other background.  The observation lasted only a minute or so.  Eventually all craft disappeared in one way or another.  The one I watched the most carefully went into or behind a cloud.   At that point I queried my other observers and they agreed, yes, they had seen them too.  The area of my observation is a few miles west of the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  No Earthly craft would likely be in that area without the knowledge and permission of the Phoenix TRACON.  Seconds after my sighting terminated an airliner departed westbound out of Sky Harbor and climbed directly through the same place in the sky that I had seen these gold-colored craft maneuvering.  The airliner made it all the more apparent by it\u2019s difference that the craft I had been observing were not Earthly craft.  The airliner was larger than the craft, moved very much more slowly, and displayed clear areas of sunlit and shadowed areas on the top and bottom of the fuselage.  I had a 20-year career as a Police Officer, was so employed at the time, and consider myself observant and objectively so.  If you\u2019ve had other reports giving the same description, one that I find to be rare among my casual UFO reading, I\u2019d be interested in knowing about them.

I saw a saucer-shaped object rise out of the desert in front of me and slowly ascend into the air, straight up, until it was out of sight. At the time, I tried to guess the size of the object and estimated that it was at least as large as a high school football stadium.  It was a dull silver color and looked like the flying saucers in old sci-fi movies.  There was absolutely no sound associated with this sighting. I thought I would see something about this in the newspaper, but did not.  I was so astounded by what I saw and thought surely someone else would report it, as I could not possibly have been the only one to see it.  I did not tell anyone for years, thinking people would think I was a nut.",

      "story": "A massive object in the sky, that shined a light in front of me that was very weird.... this happened when Iwas ten years old and around sept. 10th 1993. It was after dark on apartly cloudy night with the moon out there was no other aircaft around and the weather was good. Every Friday evening my Mom and I would walk around the school I was going to for fun Etc. on the way back about half a block from my house I was looking down and was about 7 feet behind my mom  Out of nowhere a very bright dark blue light flashes on the ground right in front of me. the best way to describe this light is it looks like the light you would see at the bottom of a pool with the water moving kinda like bubbles but not kinda like electricity, but not very weird but pretty I guess you could say the light had no noise to it. Once is saw the light i looked up to the sky and there happened to be a opening in the clouds that was a good 2 to 3 miles wide. there was a very large cloud behind me, but I saw nothing. I began to think it was so funny lightining or something like that. At this point I ask my mom did you see that she said no. At about the same time we both lookedagain to see anything one more time and out of the cloud comes a very very very large rectangle object at a very fast speed going west tored Luke Air Force Base about 7 miles west of where I am at. I lost track of it in the clouds about ten seconds after I saw it, but in those ten seconds it was proable 7 miles away already. The Clouds that night where about normal alttuide and like I said earlier the opening was about 2 to 3 miles long and about a mile wide this object was bigger then the opening in the clouds I want to say it was 12 to 15 aircarft carries long and 6 to 8 wide it was HUGH. The object had a ton of lights on it all over the place they could have been in a pattern , but it went by so fast and unexpectedly was unable to see that. The one thing I did notice was the back end of the object, the back end was all white/blue lights kinda like a rocket area or where the engines are at. The object looked to have a blueish silver metal on it. The object made no noise at all and did not displace a cloud that was the weirdest part of all for something that big, that fast, and with what looked simalur to rockets on back that was just not right. I have been a beleaver ever since. I have never seen or heard of anyhting like this ever again. also to note for the next hour after seening this my eyes were burning. if you have any questions please contact me thanks  P.S. I also saw the Phoenix lights and those in any way where not flares, even if they were there not going to do any military trainning where they were at becasue it was over a Indain resrevion and that test area they were talking about its near yuma Arizona 95 miles south west of Phoenix ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

      "story": "Rising balloon transformed into cigar craft with red light on bottom   At 11:33 p.m. on November 11, 2001 I as putting my backpack in my car, that was running in the driveway.  After closing the back door to the car I looked up to reach to open the front driver door. That was when I noticed a dull grey colored small \"birthday party\" balloon with string below. It was rising at a normal helium balloon speed and appartently coming from the neighbors, 3 houses down, backyard.  After noticing the lights all off at their home and no car in the driveway I was suspicious of how it had come from that backyard that was dark and silent.  Then, without my perceptive ability to actually see the transition, it was now instantly a dull grey cigar shaped craft about 50 feet up above the houses.  It was not a balloon anymore yet retained the same color and underneath the hull of this silent and now motionless craft was a rectangular shaped protrusion of sorts that was obviously a part of the craft's geometry. In the right corner of this short protruding box-like bottom was a brilliant, almost like DIGITAL/LED square light.  The light blinked on and off with no apparent pattern and the object was the size of 3 or 4 mini-vans worth of mass in the sky from the distance I saw it.  It slowly moved horizontally over to be closer to me standing there and remained still nearly over head for a near full minute.  Then it began accelerating in a northwesterly direction at a calm speed remaining at its altitude consistently eversince ceasing to rise upward during its time as a \"balloon of helium\". In shock I documented the event within minutes and then before leaving after only a few minutes past the event an appartent police helicopter, \"ghetto bird\" swept low over that spot of the neighborhood doing a typical orbit around the house I was at with its spotlight on, but not pointing down at me or anything and after one full circle it flew around me there, in a diameter of about 300 yards and height near the same as the craft, the helicopter then sped off in the exact direction that what I had seen left from there traveling in.",

I usually go for morning walks mid-morning at work, and this day it was quite cloudy. There was a storm that was coming in and it had not started to rain. As I walked, I looked up at the clouds to determine if it would rain soon. Among the clouds I noticed what looked like a circular platform. There might have been a rail at the top, but I can't say for certain. There were no sounds and the platform did not seem to move. It appeared to be stationary. Size of the platform is also indeterminate as I could not tell how far away it was. The platform was not directly overhead, but it was not low on the horizon. I was talking on the phone when I noticed the platform and it remained in sight for at least a minute or two. I stopped to tie my shoe laces and when I looked up, the platform disappeared. It could be that the platform was lost in the clouds. I could not make anything out on the platform, other than it was a circular shape, very much like a platform or a stage.",

One moved to the right and then rejoined the original one.  My friend was with me and witnessed this event also.  I grabbed my camera and shot these photos \u2013 if you zoom in you can see the sphere (definitely not a star or any other type of aircraft that I know of) and in the last photo you can see the faint outline of the second sphere. Since this sighting, I was again in my backyard (in May) with a friend and we saw the same sphere, but, this time it moved at a very rapid speed from south to north and, as it moved, a small strobe-like light shot out from the side and moved away to the east.  As the sphere approached the same location as the last time I had seen it, it stopped abruptly, another sphere appeared and flew off very fast to the north.  The original one hovered there for some minutes and then just faded away. The feeling I get after having witnessed is frustration at not knowing what the hell I\u2019m looking at.

It was very ink-black against the dark sky and one could differentiate the fact that it was a much darker black than the night sky. It was VERY big and was hanging like a thin black mirror in the sky, point down. This was the second UFO I've seen in my lifetime, and this one made me feel very afraid.  I think because it was so large and so black. Next, the triangle began to rotate, with the point of the triangle going up and the other points turning in a clockwise motion. What was so strange is the lights of the triangle then began to stretch and the inky blackness of it dissipated and the 3 lights shot off quickly in separate directions.

I was driving to Prescot from Green Valley, on high way 8 with my family for familly dinner, when suddenly my 8 year old son said \"Daddy!, theres' a ship in the sky!\"  Me and my wife then looked up to see three green lights in a HUGE triangle, or V formation.  The object moved about every 5 minutes, from side to side, or up and down. My wife, who was frightened said \"Call the police! Call the Police!\".  Sadly, we had left our cellphones in the baby bag at home.  So i stopped the car to look up at the strange object.  The lights were flashing green and they didn't seem to be connected to each other.  But they stayed in a straight line and continued to hover.   About 20 minutes into watching it it climbed a few 100 feet into the air and continued to hover.  It moved vigorously up and down from side to side.  As it climbed, thats lights became whiter and whiter, and soon became pure white.  For a moment, we couldn't see it because of the tree's.  But soon enough it hovered over our car.  It was at a high altitude, so i could not say if it was directly above or not.   But then it started slowly moving west, turning counter clock wise [ which was odd, because it was a triange shaped air craft ].  It then sped off at almost the speed of light maybe 50-60 miles west.  It was just above the horizon when it stopped.   Then another 5 or ten minutes later, it sped off into the horizon disappearing completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

A white light then emerged from the star and began to streak across the sky making a zig zag like pattern.

I already have numerous sighting statements on record at MUFON that I made daily during the sighting period.  My first sighting of the star-like craft was made in the afternoon here in Phoenix while I was outside on a break. I was looking up at a jetliner that was cruising overhead out of Sky Harbor International airport and I noticed what appeared to be a star shining directly over my head at about 2PM in the afternoon. I was perplexed as to why I would be able to see a star in the middle of the day when suddenly the 'star' started to move very slowly and then stop. I watched it make these manuevers for about 6 minutes but my break was almost over and I had to go back inside to work - however, I thought that I just had to figure out what it was I was looking at. It was so far up that I figured it must be at about a 60 thousand foot level or so. It started moving again and then it just 'popped' out of existence altogether ! I was freaking out at that point. I began to deliberately look up at the sky for the duration of my breaks and lunches and sure enough, every single day I saw these star-like craft just appear out of nowhere and for the most part they would just move across the sky until they were no longer in my range of sight, but the thing that really got to me was the FACT that they would just suddenly appear out of nowhere. About the 3rd day of my seeing these things, I watched a total of 5 of these things appear from the same part of the sky and then move off into different directions until I could no longer see them. On one occasion I watched two disc shaped craft fly over our building at about a 20 thousand foot level and fly side-by-side from west to east at a very fast rate of speed and disappear off in the horizon over Scottsdale Arizona. I would have to estimate that they were flying at around 2000+ miles per hour because of how quickly they traversed the sky. No sound at all came from any of these craft at any time.  I did on 2 different occasions have other employees outside with me that watched the UFO's with me so I at least had witnesses to verify what I was seeing. I don't know what I saw other than the fact that these craft made moves and achieved flight speeds that exceed any known aircraft that I have ever witnessed in my lifetime. Phoenix is has a major air force base to the west called LUKE AFB and it wouldn't surprise me to find out that they have been tracking these craft yet they will never admit it. I have a feeling that the lid is going to be blown off the ET visitors being hee on earth very soon but I for one am anxious to have it happen as soon as possible!",

I was looking toward the Southwest and my wife was looking toward the Northwest. It was light enough that the sky still had blue color in it. All of a sudden I saw a single round white-glowing object with a whitish tail going at a very high rate of speed from the East going towards the West. The object looked about the size of a pea at arms length and its tail length was approximately 10 times the size of the object. The tail size was the same as the object at its start and tapered to a point. In other words, the tail was cone shaped. It was just a glowing white object without any other features. The object was at about a 35 degree angle from where I was sitting. It was traveling at such high rate of speed that by the time I told my wife to look, it was gone. It was traveling in a straight line from East to West. I\u2019ve seen a lot of \u201cshooting stars\u201d and satellites in the California Mohave Desert near China Lake and their behavior was entirely different from what I saw yesterday evening.

I had to make a turn into the parking lot and I lost track of the object.  I parked and got out to try and reacquire it, but no luck. I got back into the car and drove to the drive through.  After I got there and ordered, and another car pulled in behind me so I couldn't back out, I saw the object again.  This time it was closer to being overhead, slightly north and east of my position. I have to take my eye off it to pull forward.  Once I stopped, I look for the object once again.  Now I see 2 objects, the new one further west of the original. I pull forward again.  Now when I look at the objects, the new one has changed color to red. The objects are moving, but so slow I could hardly tell.  The white object seems to be moving closer to the red object.  The white object starts to circle around the red object counter clockwise, all the while closing the distance between them. I have to look away to pay for my food.  I look up very briefly after taking my food and see the white object moving away from the red one.  I sped out of the drive through to a parking space; I get out and look for the objects once again.

It looked like a news helicopter panted solid black.  It was about 3 telephone poles high. After it past I saw a white light a little lower coming towards me.  Then it curved changed to red and went away from me. It was doing an oval pattern.  It was white coming towards me and red going away from me.  It was probably moving at 30 mph and covered half the length of the block but only as wide as the alley.  It made 4 passes the first three it would get a little closer each time. Then the last and fourth pass it made was right over my head.  It paused there over me for about 2 seconds. As I looked right up at it, it wasn't white or red anymore but a ball of glittering lights.  It was about the sizes of a beach ball.  Then as it went away again it turn red continued down the alley a! little farther this time.  Here is where I got goose bumps and chills.  Instead of coming back it went down and to the right so fast it left a red streak of light in the sky.  It stopped there on a dime for 1 second and changed to a bright white light.  Then it shot up and to the left so fast it left another long red streak of light in the sky and was gone.  The whole time I was watching this ball of light change colors it never made a sound.

However, after I stopped walking to get a better look at the object, I realized that it wasn't moving, but rather drifting ever so slowly, and at times, it would remain stationary.  I stood staring at the object for a number of minutes trying to decipher what it was that I was looking at.  I thought to myself, is that a balloon?  I just couldn't figure out what it was that I was looking at.  It was just a sizable black object high in the sky, about the size of an aircraft, but shapeless.  It didn't make a noise, or have any lights, but it did seem to have a whitish hue or ambience to it at times.  After a number of minutes staring at the sky, I said to myself, I must look ridiculous, so I decided to move on, not to mention that my dog was ge! tting very impatient.  I probably wouldn't have thought much more about it, but what happened next is what dictated that I report it.  I looked away for only a second or two, probably took three or four steps, and then glanced back up at it, but it was gone.  It simply disappeared.  I immediately stopped again and stared in disbelief.  It was nowhere to be seen.  There were planes flying all over the place, but no black object.  I searched the sky for a number of minutes, but it was gone.  That's when I started to question the reality of what I just witnessed.  What did I see?  There has to be a rational explanation.",

      "story": "Daylight sighting of a long cigar shaped object that  slowly disappears The object was long and thin, cigar shaped whitish/silver color although more white.  This is a rough guess but I would say it's height was somewhere between 2000 and 5000 feet.  I first thought it must be a plane as we are in the flight path of a major airport.  Started looking for wings, couldn't see any but that's not really unusual because sometimes the angle of the plane makes it impossible to see the wings.  Then I realized that the \"plane\" or \"object\" was in the wrong place for the flight pattern - too high for just taking off or landing, and too low for passing through. No contrail at all.  As I watched the object, which was flying east to west at about 65 degrees above the horizon, it appeared to just simply fade out. I was looking right at it (still looking for the wings on the thing don't ya know) as it slowly dissappeared! The effect was like a plane going behind clouds that are thin at the edges but get thicker towards the middle - I'd say about 8 to 10 seconds from the time it started to fade, to completely gone. But there were no clouds in the sky. I don't know if my eyes were playing tricks, but at the last place I saw the object - the spot where it completely vanished - there appeared a faint dark smudge - like smoke - in an otherwise clear blue sky. It dissapated in a few seconds, making me wonder if I had actually seen the smudge. I continued scanning the sky but saw nothing more.",

      "story": "1959 Saucer shaped object sighting Phoenix Arizona In 1959 in Phoenix Arizona near South Mountain on or about baseline road traveling via car west to east at approximately 9 or 10:00 p.m. a bright white light saucer shaped object flew from our right at a steep descent as if coming off or over the top of the mountain, dipping in front of us on the road and flying northeastward, fast and far into the sky to the outer atmosphere to pinpoint size and then flying to the left abruptly and disappearing like a shooting star.  It was a bright white glow which appeared to be multiple lights with no colored lights. The speed and abrupt movement was nothing like I\u2019d ever seen.  We were used to seeing and hearing jets in and around Phoenix but never at night.  Jets frequently broke the sound barrier over Phoenix during that time so we were used to seeing them and this was not one of them. There were 9 of us in the car.  My two parents and I were in the front seat and my 3 brothers and 3 sisters in the back seat.  My two parents and I saw it clearly for the duration of the event which lasted less than one minute or half a minute.  Four siblings saw the event and the other 3 were sleeping. It had to have been a weekend day because my parents would not have had us out that late on a week night. There was much commotion in the car and my parents, who were normally calm and serious, sounded alarmed and scared, which scared me.  The term UFO was not used; we all used the term \"flying saucer\" to describe it.  My father abruptly told all of us that we were never to speak of this again because the child welfare people would think they were crazy and unfit parents and take us away.  We never reported the incident to anyone. I mentioned it to my parents several years later in the 1980s and they both remembered the incident vividly.  In February 2009 all of my siblings were together and I asked if any of them remembered the incident and all four of them that witnessed it remembered the event. My parents are now deceased but all siblings are living.    Phoenix was a really small town back then.  South Mountain was a nice area, not a slum like today.  There were radio towers on top of the mountain.  From the top of South Mountain you can see all of Phoenix as well as Luke Air Force Base and Sky Harbor Airport (which was very small back then). I\u2019m reporting it now because I thought there should be some record of the incident for posterity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date in 1959.  PD))",

We also observed many planes being routed over us coming from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport that we do not normally see.  We observed this object for about 45 minutes as it finally moved very slowly towards the west until we lost it on the horizon.  As planes moved towards the object there was a white light that would emanate from the object towards the approaching plane.  This beam of light was wide and was white and very dim not bright.  The object seemed to be shaped to where it had a vertical section to a point and a larger mass at its center where most of the lights were at.

After observing the light for several minutes , I noticed that the light wasn't moving, it was quite stationary in the sky. There was also no evidence of a willowy or feathered edge, nor a trail to this light that is so characteristic of contrails. The light's shape was that of an elongated cigar whose ends seemed to be positioned N/S.  The color of this object was mainly illuminated white, with a mixture of yellow & blue throughout its corona. I cant give accurate dimensions because I do not have anything to reference it to.  But as far as scale goes, it was 3 inches long by an 1/8 inch in height. It seemed to be over the NE edge of the range that holds Lake Pleasant, so maybe 25 miles away? There were other planes in the sky, local traffic for Deer Valley Airport, as well as the usual Sky Harbor traffic.  None of these planes, regardless of altitude, had contrails. The entire duration of the sighting was less than 10 minutes before it disappeared from a clear sky.",

We started star gazing to pass the time.  Looking for shapes and I pointed out Orion to the kids.  By vision maybe 3 inches above the screen, (facing NE) there was a triangle of what appeared to be just stars, but between two of the stars was another that was fading in and out.  Thought it was cool and pointed it out to the girls.   About that time the previews started and we quit paying attention to anything else.  The previews run about 15 minutes and the screen goes dark again before the feature starts.   Looked up to see if the one fading in and out was still there, and the triangle of stars I was using to coordinate the position were gone as well.  This time of year the stars rise in the sky, i looked above and to both sides, they were simply gone.  I dont know the exact date, about 2 weeks after the news in phoenix went nuts about the return of the phoenix lights. (I dont care what the news says they were not flares, flares do not reconfigure their positions and flares sent up attached to regular(kind you buy in the store) balloons from and individuals backyard(as they claimed even less so)can not be seen from other cities, would not last that long, nor could a reg balloon hold its position with out moving before deciding to reconfigure its position then holding again.  Getting off topic sorry. I dont know much that much about space other than i love to watch the night sky.  I know what different satellites look like passing in the sky. These too are not found to simply be sitting still fading in and out, they travel in the sky.  I have no idea what i saw.  Like i said it was just interesting due to short time following the \"Deer Valley Lights\" \"Return of the Phoenix lights\" or whatever they are calling it now. This type of thing fascinates me, I have always held an interest in this field, though  never really have done anything about it. I have heard many stories from family that are absolutely out of this world \"no pun intended\" things that i was not a witness too, but know the witnesses to be honest, most of them anyway.  Things that my family has seen that cant be explained away.  But the reason i have been looking at these sights the last few weeks was to see if anyone else had seen what i saw, or espescially if they had seen what happened to it, where did it go, how did it vanish. After seeing reports from phoenix near the same timeline, i decided to go ahead and report this.

So i left to my friends house and i told her look at the sky what do you see she said my god what is that i looked up and there was all these bright silvery lights. We were in shock then coming home as i was approaching home i saw a large triangular shaped object i followed it and right when i got close enough it took off-very fast.",

Its as if I was waiting for it to move past the power lines in the foreground but it was gone.  The strangest thing about it is the fact that I had so many things on my mind that I wasn't even scared or even excited when I saw it.

Before the start of play with 13:47 on the fourth quarter game clock they show the city skyline of phoenix.  I counted roughly 5 orbs circulating the city and then disappearing all at one time.  It seems very clear they are orbs, not plans, their movement is nothing like plans and they disappear all at once.  At first I thought they were speeding up the film time and they were plans landing, but why did they all disappear at one time.  The pattern they were flying did not seem like plans at all.  I was so alarmed I DVR the rest of the game to record it. Just would like to know what it was I saw.  I've heard of white orbs spotted in Arizona before.  Thanks",

I calculated that our plain was going roughly 500 miles an hour and this thing was going at least as fast as we were. I did my reasearch and this thing was moving faster than any small aircraft can go.  Another intresting fact that should be noted is that it was flying roughly only 100 to 200 feet above the desert mountains.  I watched it for roughly one minute before it disapeared off into the horizon.  I know that this was in no way an aircraft also because i saw other aircraft earlier that were farther away smd they were completely defined, while this craft had no deffenition, no wings and no tail.  My estimation of the shape is a disc shaped object but given its rapid rate of speed it was too hard to tell.   I do not know if anyone else from that flight saw it i had no knowledge of it.",

I had seen them before I went into the store, but didn't pay that much attention, thinking they were two planes together, because it was at a distance to where I was I only glanced that way and noticed it but went into the store as I was in a hurry and on the phone at the same time. When I came out of the store around 5 minutes later, the 3 amber lights were still there, hovering, not moving since I had gone in the store, in the same exact spot and they looked like they were twinkling. there were 3 distinctive lights. What I noticed was it seem way too large to be a plane on approach to SKY HARBOR {my son and I watch planes on approach all the time} when I was watching it intensely a plane was coming from the west and dwarfed in size to these three lights. If I had to estimate the size I would say 3-4 Jet plane size wise at least. Way to big to be a regular craft. Plus they were AMBER in color, not like any normal craft lights. It was not a helicopter as it was too far to be that big. And they run with white, green and red lights. As I was watching these 3 lights I called my son on the phone to try and see it, but he was in an area that the tree lines near our house blocked the view but because I was at the field at 51st and Olive I could see clearly the area it was hovering at. I stood there for 3-4 minutes watching then I couldn't believe my eyes as the lights started to twinkle brighter then dim then the center light went out first, then the one on the right, then the one on the left. It was not a plane or helicopter, nor was it a craft I have seen at any airshow I have been to in the last 30 years. The lights were in a line next to each other but what was weird is that it was parallel, or slightly above the nearby south mountain lights but not too far above the horizon. about .5 - 10 degrees abov! e the gr ound but more over the estrella mountains side of the southland.  It was not like flares I have seen in the past, it was not like blimps or balloons we see here often in Arizona, it was 3 Amber lights close together but separate.",

And some flashing red orb shaped lights in the background Ok, so the first sighting was a very large aircraft which headed towards me from the far distance which I at first thought was an unusually large star, but as it appraoched, I saw that it had lights, and then at the same time there appeared to be unusual background activity also going on in the sky. I saw flashing red orb like lights that seemed to almost come together and then moved quickly away from eachother, meanwhile, in between there appeared to be a falling star! Now, (and I know this sounds too outrageous), but while the large craft was meanwhile approaching overhead, and it seemed to be possibly a half a mile in width It had at the front of it a horizontal line of yellow lights, and at each end, two red lights. It flew overhead as I watched from my balcony, and was then out of view. I kept on trying to tell myself that it must have been an airplane, but I didn't know what the other orb lights were all about in the distance. And if that were not enough!!I then heard what sounded like another approaching plane or craft overhead, flying in the opposite direction heading towards the west valley, which was a huge, triangular shaped craft ( as I saw that it was indeed a solidly shaped triangular craft ) with maybe three lights. But as it was gliding over the valley away from me, it appeared to have onlt two white flashing lights, that then dimmed one the lights as the other light kept flashing on and off. I watched this craft until I could no longer see it gliding away in the distance. Now I have NEVER seen anything in the sky unusual except maybe a falling star only once in my lifetime. I have no idea what these were, but i reported the sighting to the ArizonaRepublic newsroom.",

One interesting characteristic about this is that when I saw the lights, there  seemed to be an aura or hue.  It was dark, so I could not clearly see the craft, but it seemed to have a metallic, or \"mother of pearl\" look and I could see the shape of the craft was round and appeared to be roughly the size of a dime.

It disappeared at about 20 degrees above the horizon in about 5-6 seconds at what I believe was approximately 2000 to 3000 feet in elevation above my home.  No sound or shockwave was evident, no vapor trail, only the sound of chirping crickets. The sky was cloudless and winds calm.  As the object moved directly overhead the neighborhood dogs began barking as if startled and as soon as the object disappeared they stopped.  Airplanes in a pattern for Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport were plainly visible along with the outline of the aircraft and cross the pattern at about 5000 feet at 150 knots.  No outline was visible with the glowing object which I would describe as the glow of a toaster against a wall and not that of a nozzle of a fighter jet.

      "story": "2 strange craft spotted over Phoenix, Arizona Tonight, two strange objects were spotted over Phoenix.  The objects initially looked like meteors as they appeared one after the other and left a trail of sparks in a streak.  When the first object stopped emitting sparks, it changed direction, and then the other object did the same thing.  Both objects then started changing direction numerous times, occasionally emitting sparks.  On a couple of occasions, the objects appeared to hover briefly before moving again.  The objects first appeared overhead moving west to east and appeared to be moving at a very high speed.  After about two minutes of high speed travel, both objects traveled beyond view.  The estimated distance traveled was well over the Phoenix metro area.  Neither object made a sound and no chase vehicles were observed.",

      "story": "Very High star-like dot of light, high speed, crossing sky, then abruptly 'shot' into space, faded out. These two events occurred in 1989 and 1995 respectfully (approximate) in Phoenix AZ.  I lived North of the city, pretty dark in those days. The first:  Facing South, a white, star-like solid light, like a medium size star, appeared in the sky very, very high up, at an almost-directly-overhead latitude and crossing the sky coming out of the East to West. I immediately thought it was a satellite. Way too high to be an airplane.  It was either already in space or just on the fringe. And faster than a satellite I was use to seeing. But just as I told the person I was with to \"look, it's a satellite\", the object stopped crossing the sky half way, almost directly overhead, and literally stopped on a dime, and then went straight up into space, fading out.  It didn't continue across the sky like a satellite would and then instantly 'blink' out when it went into earth's shadow.  This object went straight up.  A 90-degree instant 'turn' up into space.  I verified this in my mind by acknowledging that it did not 'cross' any more stars in any direction. I'm a private pilot, university graduate and voluminous readings, I know of nothing that would act like this, particularly that it was so high to start with, traverse half the sky, and then abruptly stop and go into space and fade out, not suddenly blink out. Now here's the kicker:  about six years later, my wife and I were standing in my backyard, same house, facing North this time, looking up towards the horizon, not straight up.  I had told her my UFO story. Suddenly, There...I instantly knew it was the same 'object', probably because it\u2019s so different then my \u2018normal\u2019. It suddenly appeared coming at us, from North to South this time, crossing the sky towards us at a very fast speed.  Both were traveling much faster then the satellites I've seen crossing the sky.  So, from first sighting it near the horizon to it going up into space took about seven seconds and then another two/three seconds as it faded out)   Without taking my eyes off of it this time, I told my wife, \"see the light coming at us?\"   Watch...it\u2019s going to come almost overhead, stop, and then go straight up into space and fade out!   And it did just that as I was describing what it would do to her!!  Again, never went 'by' any more starts verifying that it did indeed go 'straight up' into space. And now I have a witness who's always with me (married). so now it's 'we' who saw it!  Ran across your article in the SOCO Magazine here in Boston MA and thought I'd send you this 'tale'.  I've seen rockets launched in the Air Force (I worked on Minuteman Missiles), saw the shuttle launch in Fla., a missile 'blowup' just after launch in New Mexico (from our backyard in Phx) leaving the colorful contrails from the rising morning sun, we've seen satellites, the shuttle, the space station (as I acknowledged, they cross the 'entire' sky then suddenly blink out when they go into the earth's shadow) but I\u2019ve never seen anything this high in the sky, just a 'bright' dot of a light, that initially looked like a satellite but traveling much faster, stop on 'a dime', and go straight up into space and just fade out. Any ideas as to what these/this could have been? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "bright light, missing time   Although this happened many years ago, I am just now able to talk about it.  I struggled for years as to whether this was an actual event or just some sort of hallucination... The year was 1968, I was playing guitar and traveling the country with a band in a small VW van.  We criscrossed the USA playing music, groovin' with the groupies and partaking of the various indigenous plant life. We were in Arizona playing at a local club just outside of Phoenix, can't recall the name of the place, but it was a stone cold groove that night!   After the gig around 2 or 3 AM we were hanging out in the van having some 'sandwiches' when one of the guys noticed a bright light in the distance.  We all thought it was the cops cause it was so bright, like a search light. Being ever suspicious of the 'man' back then, we stowed our 'sandwiches' and waited.  Well it didn't take long before we realized it was not a cop car search light.  But something we could not explain. At first I thought maybe it was the 'sandwiches' but I wasn't the only one that saw this thing.  Some of us started giggling uncontrollably, I wet myself, and our sound guy fainted. Next thing I know I am in a room laying on a table looking up at some very bight lights.  Not cool... I was freakin' out.  Then things started to get weird. Two skinny pale dudes, with big eyes.  I can't talk about what all they did, I think I blocked it out to keep my sanity.  However I had the a sour stomach for a couple of weeks afterwards, difficulty urinating.  Kind of a cruel preview of how things are for me at age 60. I don't remember being returned to the van, but we all woke up in the van naked, which in itself was quite traumatic.  Several hours had passed, but none of us could clearly recall what happened. None of use ever talked about what happened that night, it was too weird and strange, even for the 60's, and that is saying something. I know this all sounds crazy, but it REALLY DID happen. What can I do to get some help?  I still have night terrors, flash backs and more from this incident.  I found your site using the Google, I have no where else to turn. Thank you for listening.

      "story": "I was in my patio that faces west and sitting facing north, around 12:15 pm on October 23, 2011.  I was in conversation having a smoke when I noticed a white string of balloons floating across the sky towards the west.  The angle was about 35 degrees, distance not more than 2 miles in the sky (guessing), from my sitting position.  This was no big deal but as they floated the objects started falling out of formation in the sky, kind of like RC planes.  I\u2019m staring at them trying to make out what they were.  The shape was hard to make out because there were no distinct edges or sharp lines to make out the object shapes.  They all were similar to a balloon and had flattened edges at the sides.  On the flattened edges, one side seemed to be thicker than the other.  They all were the same size and color, white with a dark bottom.  Then I start to see them move erratically, one at a time like dominoes, going downward and at different angles like in \u201cflat Z\u201d free f! all, some left to right and to and from me\u20262-3 others moved curving towards the ground and eastward.  They moved through the sky and seemed to glimmer from the reflection of the sun as the made \u201cfalling moves with quick pivot positions\u201d (the \u201cflat Z\u201d free fall). The movement would be similar to a butterfly falling from the sky.  They all changed direction at the same time, came to a weird shaped \u201cV\u201d, moving northeast, and with a change of angle of about 5 degrees from the Earth\u2019s surface.  They floated in the sky away from me, back in a straight line, and then formed a \u201cV\u201d pointed towards the north, and it did not seem to be parallel with the ground either.  The fascinating thing is as the objects were moving this entire time through the sky they still seemed to be \u201cfloating in the wind\u201d when not moving erratically. They dropped down about 3 inches from my vantage point in the sky when completing the \u201cV\u201d and went behind a roof.  I was in shock and ran through the house, gra! bbed my cell phone on the couch (try and snap a picture), and ! ran out front door.  I went in the middle of the street and witness them still flying in the \u201cV\u201d formation, again not parallel to the ground, towards the north and then they completely disappeared!!  They were not high in the atmosphere nor did the duck behind a building.  They completely disappeared into the \u201cbig blue sky\u201d without a trace. The objects were West of the Sky Harbor Airport in Central Phoenix.",

The object appeared to be a solid \u201ccraft\u201d or aerial vehicle of unknown type. (as opposed to just a set of lights in the sky)  Duration of the sighting was brief, approximately 15 seconds, during which time the object performed various maneuvers, and displayed very unusual lights. When first spotted, by the passenger (Right, front seat) the saucer shaped object was hovering, or flying very slowly, with it's circular plane horizontal, or parallel to the ground.  It then tilted, or rotated towards the cars on the freeway, whereupon a single blue and red light (spaced closely together on the forward facing rim) illuminated, and then began \u201cpropagating\u201d around the rim, in opposite directions. (Blue lights, clockwise, Red lights, counter-clockwise)  At the same time, it became apparent, the saucer shaped object was domed on it's upper surface.  Also, at the same time, the entire object, or craft was observed to rotate counter clockwise, while the lights around it's rim, remained stationary. The object then began moving north, towards the observer's car, and vanished from sight.  The two witnesses left the freeway at the next exit (Cactus Road) pulling over as soon as possible to try to spot the object again.  While doing this, they observed another couple, apparently doing the same thing. The driver of the witness car produced the attached drawing.",

I think its finally time to talk... I was in my back yard, and my dog was barking like crazy, i was trying to get her to be quiet, she kept running back and fourth in the yard, jumping up the fence, like as if chasing a cat... she was barking and she sat in the middle of the yard. and i finally got up one last time to bring her inside, but as soon as i got next to her she stopped barking. it was so silent. at night, you can see the stars... for the most part... there wasn't any. it was pitch black. i mean, NOTHING. it, the stars i mean, were in the shape of a ellipse, but i don't know for sure. my phone broke, like, literally. broke. the battery was dripping. i don't know what happened next. i woke up in my room and i haven't talked to anyone except for one person. The second encounter i had, which I've sent before, was in my living room. in the morning. the sun was barely rising. it was around 4 or 5, summer. and i looked out the window. and. there it was. clear as day. a being. Its face was like a bony mans, very skinny, sucked in to the bone.  it had no eyes. no nose. it had holes on the sides of its head, which, i thought were like a reptiles ears. but this was pale, flesh. it looked human. but it had the slightest green in it. blue in some spots. it was tall, but hunched over, it had four arms, and very small legs. it had a very large spine, like, it was long, and it was very prominent, very easy to see through its flesh. it had something else, where our ribs would be.  It looked like gills, they were bright pink. no tail.  I dropped my glass of milk and he/it turned to look at me.  It stared. for what felt like hours...  I know exactly what it looks like.  I could almost feel the creature through the glass.  I blacked out.  I woke up lat! er around 12. And lastly. the reason why I reported this entire three story's.  was because i was in page with a friend, hes Navajo , and he took  me to meet his family on the reservation. that first night, we went out at about 12, we got up, on top of this huge sandstone ridge, and he said that his father told him never to leave at night, blah blah blah right? i'm a boy, i'm 14. i didn't listen. mind you i'm a very intelligent 14 year old boy. I should have listened.  There was a bright light.  illuminated the valley. it was a bright as day, it grew brighter and brighter. and then it kind of coned into a small area, like a stage light.  but really bright, we could feel the heat, and it was very cold. anyway, the cone of light grew so small you could barely see it, yet it grew hotter and hotter. it was like a laser. technically, by definition a light is a laser. but whatever.   BACK TO THE STORY.  A loud buzzing sound started, it was a low hum, then a loud ring. then. complete silence but it was! bright, the light sketched across the sand like lighting or a crack in the ice. we ran faster then I've ran before. *living in the ghettos of Arizona, especially being white, you have a lot of things to run from*   We decided to walk back to the sands after last night, and we walked out there, and it was over cast, raining.... but the rain was caught and wouldn't sink more then a few feet inches. we dug in. for a radius of thirty feet, there was glass.  It looked like a spider web on the top, with a plate under it. we dug it up and, it looked random to me, but who knows, the father said to leave it and its gods work, its not for the media, so we buried it. Shortly after the mans cattle and sheep started to disappear. I NEED a follow up please, i really want this to be at least seen by someone. I almost feel like the one person i told doesn't believe me\u2026",

At the same time, I heard a woman gasp a few rows ahead of me which led me to believe I wasn\u2019t the only one to witness this strange object.  The object was small (beach ball size), silver/chrome, round and had a red light or glow to it.  It was within 40 feet of the plane, above the wing on the left side (or right side from my perspective). Once we landed in Phoenix, I had intended to ask the pilots if they had seen anything strange but when I got to the exit, the pilots were already gone which I found very peculiar.

I was driving so I could only take side glances at it while driving.

No such lights have ever been present in this neighborhood as I work in a business only six blocks from where I saw these lights.  The lights from a distant seemed stranded together but upon arriving for a view under each light each object was separate from the others. Each shape (kind of oval) was uniformed throughout.  Each had a different altitude(some higher some lower)from one another. And each craft had two oscilating, dull lights on the their underside.  To be honest, they looked like candles flickering and masked inside a pumpkin except that there were no openings but rather light that was diffused as being filtered/masked as if inside a lamp shade or parachute material.

It was about as bright as say, maybe 1/5th of a full Moon-or brighter than any star in the Big or Little Dipper, say. It made a semicircle almost overhead, then went SE towards the City of Tempe, then vanished in the clouds. It would make 3 graduatingly brighter flashes, then dim-down again, while in flight.  I did attempt to photograph it, but my celphone couldn't catch it due to the general lighting of the area.  I am a trained observer.  I've been a security officer, at least P/T for almost 34 years.

Not a small meteor with a smoke trail (I've seen those too) -  This was fully on fire, and huge, much like a movie set. Once it hit the clouds, it blinked out.  Three seconds later, two very bright and disticnt orbs started free falling to earth from the spot that the metoer dissapeared, only not straight down.  It took 4 mins for them to reach the surface, after going this way and that, pausing, and circling down to the ground.  It was like the two orbs were dancing with each other on the way down.

Dear Sir or Madam:  I am contacting your office to report what might be UFO activity, if not some kind of cyber villain activity.  At the location where I work I have been observing something that I feel is very much abnormal and should be seriously looked into.  During the past month or so I have been noticing 2 large and exceptionally bright star-like objects appear in the sky coming from the Northeast direction.  This occurs between about 3 \u2013 5 am.  Over the last 3 days it has been occurring between about 2-5 am.  Unlike other stars that are in the sky throughout the night, these objects change position in the sky with my movement on the ground.  No matter where I go I can see these objects from exactly the same angle.  Over the past several months I have been making this same observation but the star-like objects came in from the western sky and they usually remained in the area throughout the night.  I have considered the possibility of a private person with illegally obtained technology, attempting to harass and intimidate me and my coworker just to make himself or herself feel important.  However it has been recommended that I report this as possible UFO activity. When I make observations of unusual activity I usually have no doubt as to whether I am seeing what I think I am seeing, but I still attempt to confirm it by pointing it out to others.  My coworker said he has made the same observations and I have pointed it out to at least one other person who works in the area.  While making these observations I have never felt nervous or afraid that I was being pursued by UFO\u2019s or Extraterrestrials.  What I have felt and still feel is mental distress from the belief that this is very abnormal and so far no one has given me any assistance whatsoever with understanding what this is. In the past I have contacted the Arizona Society of Astrologers, but no one has answered and attempted to assist in any way. Your attention and consideration will be greatly appreciated.",

      "story": "UFO Sightings in New York State similar to those reported on the June 20, 2012 Coast to Coast AM show. UFO  Report to NUFORC    I have experienced three UFO sightings, one with my daughter, one alone and most recently with my daughter\u2019s boyfriend.   I had no intention of reporting my experiences until I received the Coast to Coast AM e-mail update on the June 20, 2012 show dealing with red-orange-yellow spherical UFO\u2019s.   This is exactly the type of UFO I experienced all three times and the C2C show inspired me to report my experiences to NUFORC.  I did not have any way or chance to video any of these sightings.  The first sighting was my very first experience and it happened approximately 11:15 pm about 10 miles north of Syracuse , NY on August 30, 2011.  I pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car and watched the object approximately 10 minutes until it \u201cdisappeared\u201d instantly.  It was moving very slowly overhead at maybe 2000 feet from NW to NE moving maybe a quarter of a mile along a straight path at constant altitude. There was no sound at all.  It appeared to be \u201cpulsing\u201d from red-orange and some yellow, kind of like a \u201cglowing\u201d ball almost like \u201cfire\u201d.  It was hard to estimate the size of the object  but it was larger than the lights of a landing aircraft or helicopter and much larger than when Venus was very visible this spring. (2012)   I KNOW it was NOT an aircraft, planet, balloon, flare, parachute or star.  I wonder if it could have been a secret military drone.  The following two sightings were essentially \u201cidentical\u201d to the first in the appearance and characteristics of the objects.  The second sighting occurred on June 14, 2012 at approximately 8:45pm in  Oswego, NY.    The object moved in a straight line NW to N. I observed it for about one minute and it moved out of site...it did not disappear. The last sighting was June 16, 2012 about 10:15 pm also in Oswego, NY.  It moved in a straight path S to N over the roof of my house I estimate at 2000 feet.  No sound and VERY slow and we observed it for about 5 minutes when it \u201cdisappeared\u201d instantly. I KNOW it was not an aircraft, balloon or satellite . There was one difference in this object over the first two. I wear glasses and the object was so bright that it seemed to cause \u201c radiant spikes\u201d from the general spherical shape. I took my glasses off and these \u201cspikes\u201d disappeared and I was able to make out a king of pulsing between the spherical shape to a kind of cubical-elongated shape. This made me think of a military drone of some kind.   I have no idea what my 3 UFO\u2019s were other than \u201cunidentified.\u201d",

At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO\u2019s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert At 8:30 P.M. on the 27th of July, 2012, my husband and I were walking our dogs and saw several UFO\u2019s at the end of our street. We live on the edge of the Sonoran Desert in North Phoenix near Cave Creek, AZ. and always enjoy the view. The mountains and horizon looked like a postcard and the horizon was purplish blue. As I gazed up at the sky, I noticed that there were a lot of trails crossing the sky. In fact, the sky was full of them. And there seemed to be a gigantic X in the sky where two of the largest ones crossed each other. My husband and I thought that this was very odd indeed. On further reflection, it seemed that the X marked a meeting spot. Then we noticed that coming from the north, very high in the horizon, what appeared at first to be a plane was not a plane at all. It was soundless, for one thing and moved erratically.  I could not believe my eyes. It jumped around sporadically in a fashion that no plane is capable of doing. As it jumped, it blinked, and then it hovered, waiting. Why was it waiting?  Then we noticed that an actual plane ( or what seemed at first to be a plane) was some distance from it but seemed to have some connection with this object as well as the other unidentified flying objects. This first one would not continue on its path until the plane- or what appeared to be a plane- turned off its lights. At that point, the object flew in a southernly direction in a slightly more normal path though at no time did any of them have the noise of a plane. This happened several times. We saw seven of them, and they did not all appear to be exactly the same though they all did act in an erratic fashion. Some had orangish lights and some had greenish lights. Some were bigger than others and seemed to have lights that blinked as if they were  rotating discs. The smallest of these were more cigar or bullet shaped and the size of a plane, but two seemed to be much larger. One was in the shape of a triangle. We watched fascinated. Before we left, one of the very largest ones first hovered and then headed in the opposite direction. It first headed closer to us and then followed us across the street like a low flying plane above the trees which made me feel quite uneasy indeed. Except for the last one, we lost sight of all objects over the horizon or they seemed to just disappear. Also, while this was going on at one point we looked at the moon and it was clear. Five minutes later there was a distinct trail across it- like a long line. There were no lights moving in the area. If it was created by a chemtrail in the area, then the flying object had no lights as we saw nothing saw cross the moon. It is odd that they all came from the same exact place and seemingly from out of nowhere.  We watched them as they appeared. My husband  now suggests it was perhaps from the area of 51 Las Vegas. They all headed in the same direction ( seemed to be Goldwater Preserve SW of Phoenix). We could not identify any landing. One flew back to the point of origin, inexplicably. The rest, five, continued on out of our sight except for the last one which followed us. It seemed to be a convoy mission of some sort ( some escorting others into the area that they were all headed).  The \u201cplane\u201d that shut its lights off and then on from the object waiting to make its flight seemed to be giving it a signal to pass. Also, not only was their behavior bizarre (hovering and stationary and then deep ascents or descents), soundless, and erratic, but they appeared to have come from a much greater distance than a plane possibly could. When they first appeared, they seemed to be brighter than the brightest star, so perhaps that gives some indication of size and distance. It seems as if they came out of thin air and were at first at a much greater distance. In fact, at first they looked star like, then like several  bright points that jumped around a bit( to get stabilized?) and then, coming closer (it appeared) into our atmosphere, you could detect some type of shape with lights (green or red) at the bottom of the unidentified flying object.  They all moved noiselessly unlike planes and were able to move in a manner unlike any plane. We did not take our eyes off of them, but I had the creepy feeling with some of them that they were trying to approximate the look of a plane once they began to f! ly in the same southwesterly direction. However, planes do not shut their lights off or hover and come to a standstill, planes do not come out of nowhere as far away as a star then jump in inexplicable patterns, and planes do not fly noiselessly.  I was not sure whether or not they actually changed their shape or the shape came into focus as it came closer. My husband and I are serious, well-educated, and professional people and have no reason to be making this up.",

Is it possible that it was someone with a laser pointer? Perhaps but it was VERY steady, not sharp movements at all and it really did not look like a laser, there was no beam, just did not look like a laser to me. I have video if interested.",

We noticed by the stars disappearing in front of the object and reappearing behind that it was moving.  There were no flashing lights and no sound.  We had seen blimps over Phoenix that covered sporting events and they are very loud.  Also this was much larger than any conventional craft I had ever seen,  If it was a craft.  We could not see any structure.(estimate, 400 yards long x 250 yards wide)  No one in the neighborhood said they saw it and no mention in the news.

      "story": "Three large orange lights / triangular craft, North-Central Phoenix The object consisted of three large orange lights, formed in a rather straight line (although the center light seemed to be slightly lower the other two, but only by a hair). Though the lights were not visibly connected by any sort of discernible fuselage, I got the sense that they were each part of one singular craft. The distance between each light was equal. I also got a strong sense that this object was triangular, perhaps equilateral. Moreover, it was quite large; much much larger than any aircraft I\u2019ve seen before. The craft made no discernibly significant shifts in position, neither vertically nor horizontally. It just hovered. Situated over flat terrain, and above a heavily-populated, low-lying residential area, it hung in the night-sky at a relatively low altitude (much lower than planes departing from or approaching Sky Harbor). I was driving south on I-51 at 10:28pm. As I approached Shea\u2019s exit ramp I saw what I thought was an extremely large (and normal) aircraft off to the west; three large orange lights (what looked to be the lighted ends of each wingtip and nose). I passed the exit and soon lost my view of the object due to topography (a small mountain range just beside the road within northwest section of Phoenix Mountain Preserve, west side of the 51). Beyond this exit, I-51 makes a series of curves through the range. Coming around the last major bend (near Dreamy Draw), I gained sight of the object again. I thought it looked quite peculiar, but I almost wrote it off as nothing special. I continued to look at it as I came around the curve, and finally decided to pull off onto the shoulder to get a better look. Trees obstructed the view, but I could see two of the tree lights through the branches. I slinked over the center console into the passenger seat, pulled my binoculars out of the glove box, opened the passenger window, and saw that it was definitely no ordinary craft. Since the object looked like it was going to move out of the trees any moment, I waited for about 10 seconds before I grew impatient. I jumped out of the car (with the binoculars) and walked 15 ft up the shoulder (north), giving me a clear view of the object straight west. Three large orange lights hovered over north-central Phoenix. From where I was standing the object was almost eye-level, but slightly higher. Its distance was too hard to judge, but if I had to guess, I\u2019d say it was roughly 500 yards away. Maybe more. This didn\u2019t seem to be an ordinary craft because: 1) the lights on the craft were orange; 2) given its distance from me, the lights on the craft were very very large (about the size of a racquet ball held away at arm\u2019s length); 3) the punctuated distance of one light from another signified a wingspan significantly larger than any craft I\u2019ve ever seen before; and 4) It hovered (demonstrating no positional shifts). I heard nothing but the traffic of I-51, thus if any sound was associated with the object, it was not heard. I watched it for about 4 minutes. At one point the object seemed to be coming closer as the lights grew slightly larger. Then the object seemed to slowly retreat, as the lights got smaller and more defined (i.e. the edge of each light became much sharper, less hazy).  At this point I decided to try to exit the freeway and head west along Glendale to get a better look.  Being on a really unsafe section of the road, parked on a narrow shoulder, I decided I best be moving along anyway. As soon as I left the shoulder of I-51 I lost sight of the object. When I exited at Glendale, the object remained unseen as I drove west to central (about 3.5 miles) and decided to turn around and continue down the 51.  Either visibility hindered my ability to see the object, or the object was no longer present. Given the size, location, and duration of time the object was visible, I\u2019d have a hard time believing I was the only one who saw this. I snapped a photo, but it is extremely blurry.",

It immediately got the attention of me as well as a few coworkers who were with me. It was completly silent.  It bobbed and weaved in a general vicinity for about 15 minutes before moving over the horizon, where I lost visual contact. The color was the most striking feature of this object.  At times it appeared a solid magenta, but at other times it almost looked like a black light with a blue aura. It seemed like it was about a mile away tops, and about 1000 feet up.  Planes passed by in the background and were MUCH further away.  If it were a plane or helocopter, the engines/rotors should have been easily heard. I initially thought it could have been a balloon tied to the ground bobbing in the wind with a light attached, but as it started moving far from the original spot, towards the horizon and back, far out of the range of a balloon string, I ruled that out. I captured about 5 minutes of footage with my phone.  It conveys the silence and the movement, but falls short on conveying the intense color of the light.  I started filming about a minute or 2 after i spotted it and the video ends about 8 minutes before I lost visual. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpyArOlPiw&list=UU-ViVnRJYEqpn9TCGjTNIA&index=1&feature=plcp",

      "story": "UFO sighting over  Rose Mofford Park in West Phoenix, AZ on 01-31-2012 at 3:30pm ... formation of 6 muted color Orbs, cloaked. On January 31st, 2012, at 3:30 pm I decided to go from my home to clear my mind at a large park about two miles away from my home (very peaceful place).  I was at Rose Mofford Park located at 9833 N. 25th Ave. Phoenix, AZ (on 25th avenue just north of dunlap). This park generally has many people playing sports in the afternoon and some people having lunch or relaxing during the day.  At that time of the day I had walked buy two full soccer games involving preteens and kids.  I decided since I wanted peace and sunlight that I would avoid the soccer fields and go on the way to the running track area, which I did.  I proceeded to lay down on the grass on the outside of the track on it's west side.  It was completely cloudless that day which is very typical of Phoenix.  I was affixed at looking into the sky as I did when I was a child... like looking at the clouds and guessing what they might resemble.  That was my state of mind at the time. I soon noticed a small dot in the sky that could have not bee a plane by any stretch of the imagination. I looked a little deeper and thought it couldn't be a bird... no bird would ever fly so high alone that it was nothing more than a tiny black dot (size of a pin head or smaller).  I chose to ignore that dot and decided to gaze at the whole sky rather just out of relaxation.  I widened my gaze and the whole viewable sky  and immediately came across something out of place... a formation of 6 semi transparent or muted color orbs forming a slightly unorganized cross system.  One orb was a darker gray color and was bigger than the others, this orb was off center (top left of the cross intersection).  This system of orbs moved slowly across the sky (as if quietly cruising) as one unchanging group.  None of the orbs moved independently of the others.  They moved as one system. In between the orbs it appeared just as the rest of the sky or completely transparent. I was baffled, but not surprised or skeptical to see this.  This is the second time I've seen a truly unmistakable alien craft or UFO in the sky and don't regularly go looking for them at all.  Even my choice to go to the park to clear my mind in the middle of the day like that was absolutely out of character (been at leased a whole year since I did that type of thing). To debunk any skeptics, yes I was here when Phoenix lights occurred but was not an eye witness in any way. For the record, that event doesn't & didn't cross my mind during this sighting.  That event was never fresh in my mind since I had no personal attachment to / experience with it.  With that said, the Phoenix Lights event has no bearing on my current experience.  I was not looking for this sort of thing,... it just happened!   My belief system as for Phoenix Lights is this: I believed it was true and happened physically as well as that it was a real space craft driven by either our govt or other intelligent species from within our galaxy.  As said before, I actually was not an eye witness of the Phoenix lights, but from all videos and said descriptions of the sighting from eye witnesses, this UFO that I saw had / was using what appeared to be the same type of cloaking technology where I could see the normal sky in between  the orbs.  Also, this UFO appeared much higher in the sky and didn't form a chevron like the Phoenix Lights one did. In a nutshell, I 100% without a doubt know I saw an alien or possibly top secret government craft that was cloaked and peacefully traveling over West Phoenix that day on Junuary 31st, 2012 at 3:30pm in the afternoon.  Hopefully others might have seen it as well and can confirm it with me.",

Only Lights  Story 1:  In the late 1980's I worked at a banking processing center here in Phoenix, AZ, (Bell Road and the I-17), on the night shift.  It was common for us to finish our work midnight or later, then hang around in the parking lot for some time chatting afterwards.  Due to the type of work we were doing, it was only breaks and non-work time that would provide us a chance to talk. One night, after mid-night, we must have stood around talking for nearly 45-60 minutes.  The entire time it looked as if there was a light cloud cover over head and behind the clouds were single lights that slowly came on and then faded off.  It seemed to cover the whole sky directly over head and had been going on when we got out there and continued on when we all left. We all saw it.  Commented on it.  Wondered what it was. But never once...at least not until the next day... did any of us think of it in terms of &quot;UFO's&quot;.  Then of course, it was a done deal and no one knew what else to do with the information. Story 2: I worked at this site for about 11 years.   Every night at break, 8-8:30PM, I would walk the perimeter of the business park, since we did a lot of sitting for the job.  Another night...and I wish I could remember how much later it was, as it could have been months or years...I just don't know.... I was out walking and looked to the western sky, it must have been close to summer as the sky was still a little lit up. What I saw was similar to the earlier light(s), except the was only one cloud in the sky and as I watched it, it looked to have a light behind it.  Like someone was holding a giant flashlight behind a cloud. The odder part was, as I watched, the cloud began to shrink and the light faded with it until the sky was clear of any cloud, or light in about 5 minutes or less. There was a co-worker, who was off that night, who I mentioned this to the next day when we were together.  She had been out walking with her husband and said she saw the same thing around the same time...however, she saw it in the northwestern sky, not the western sky,  like I had.  And she lived further north of where we worked. Neither of us had any of the classic symptoms, like lost time or lost memory.  Never saw any craft or movements, other than the fading on and off of the lights both times.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen anything like that since.  Yet, I have heard of folks who say they see lights over the White Tank Mountains to the west of the valley all the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

Last night, Larry Sloss saw the HTV-4 in hot pursuit of the ISS in the twilight skies over Priest Lake, Idaho:  \"The HTV-4 was trailing the ISS by just 3 seconds,\" says Sloss.  Many observers noted \"HTV-4 flares\" this week. Apparently sunlight is glinting off a flat surface of the spacecraft, briefly raising its luminosity to match that of the much larger ISS. Sloss saw one too: \"In the image, a brief, bright flare from the HTV-4 is slightly offset from the ISS trail.\"  HTV-4 has an interesting payload.  Among the 5.4 tons of food, spare parts, and other supplies are Kirobo, a talking robot to join the crew of the ISS, and Firestation, an experiment to study mysterious Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes.  Update:  The HTV-4 docked to the space station at 11:38 EDT on Friday, Aug. 9th.  Unloading has commenced.

Suddenly 9 orange lights appeared in the southeast horizon and were moving in an irregular formation.  Each one then slowly dimmed and went out.  My son took pictures of the lights with his cell phone.  We stayed outside approximately 10 mins more to see if they would return but they did not.  Did anyone else see and/or report these lights?  (We are visiting family here in Ahwatukee, AZ for the Christmas holiday.)   He will send his video once you tell us where to email it.",

      "story": "Amber-Orange light over Phoenix This sighting of 1 object, occurred in central Phoenix, at 3:33 am, Wednesday, July (sic.  August) 14, 2013. As I walked outside, I immediately noticed an object due north of my position, approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. Object moved on a west, north-west to east, south-east heading.  When it seemed to be almost overhead, but still slightly east of my position, it executed a smart left turn for a heading of approximately due east. Object, then abruptly slowed, to approximately half it's previous speed.  It almost came to a full stop, but slowly continued on a due east course for about 45 seconds, then began to dim in brightness, until after another 15 to 20 seconds, the light seemed to just \u201cturn off\u201d. Object was a brilliant orange-amber light, about the size of a green pea held at arms length.  The color and intensity were very vivid, and at first dazzling.  It had a similar appearance, and brilliance to the landing flood lights of a passenger jet coming head on, except the color of the light was a very intense amber-orange.  Duration of this sighting was two and a half, to three minutes. I do not think this object was some sort of \u201cflare\u201d tied to a balloon, although that remains a possibility. 3:30 am on a Wednesday morning does not strike me as good timing for a hoax.  Still, the thought did occur to me.  Upon returning inside my home, I examined three internet based weather stations very close to my home. Weather conditions were, lightly scattered clouds, with calm wind conditions.  All three showed wind conditions of 1 mph or less at the time of this sighting, reporting \u201ccalm\u201d with no wind direction indicated.  I have archived these weather stations by URL, and by taking screen captures.",

We had used clear blinking lights that we had placed in a Red-Green-Yellow-Blue order.  All of the bulb's were working and had begun to flash on and off. We then noticed that about a half dozen of the lights furthest from us had begun to chase themselves back and forth numerous times.  We were both amazed. I continued to watch this light show when I noticed my wife was not.  Her attention had been caught by movement over the top of the house. Looking upwards I caught sight of the object that she was looking at.  There at about 50ft above the house was a oblong (?) shaped craft that was moving silently in a southernly direction.  It seemed to be reflecting the color's of the light's -Red-Green-Yellow-Blue. We think the craft was about 10-15 ft long.  It seemed to have no external propulsion system, no navigation light's nor rudder.  It did seem to have electro-chromatic skin though. We eventually lost sight of the craft as we had to run around a tree in the front yard to see it. It was gone. We have not seen it since then.",

I have been employed as an Airfield Management Specialist in the United States Air Force and I am currently a Senior Airport Operations Technician.  I have worked in some remote locations all over the world, including RAF Bentwaters/Woodbridge, United Kingdom.  I have an aviation degree from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and an accumulative 20 years of aviation experience.  My experince includes service at seven airports (Military, Civilian, Foreign and Domestic. I saw the 15-20 circular shaped objects fly, low-level (Appx 1000ft AGL), over my north Phoenix house on Saturday, 5/25.  As close as I was to them, you could see a candlelight burning inside what appeared to be helium balloons.  The color was definitely yellow, then orange.  The winds aloft were quite strong, so the balloons moved at a good pace until they flew far enough out of sight and burned themselves out.  I knew, as well as the other witnesses knew, that people would report seeing strange objects because they weren't close enough to see what they actually were.  If you were in a different part of the valley, it would have been easy to assume that these objects were extraterrestrial.  One of the other witnesses got video footage and he is a pilot, with an Aeronautical Engineering degree as well.  Our conclusion was it was definitely a HOAX.  Another witness was a retired Air Force airplane crew chief and worked as a civilian crew chief at a local Fixed-Base Operations.  After showing the video footage to some friends the next day, one lady commented that she had seen a documentary on the local news about people illuminating and releasing these balloons as a commemoration for family deaths and or ceremonious or tragic events that have occurred.  Definitely a HOAX. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We are somewhat sceptical about this report.  Launching balloons does not constitute a hoax.  It is only if the people launching the balloons intend to mislead witnesses that it could be labelled a hoax, and there appears to be no indication that their intention was to mislead.  PD))",

About 9 orbs broke off and hovered. what looked like to my angle over sky harbor or even a bit more to the north of the airport. so the 9 the broke off. 3 started to form a triangle with one blinking (strobing) fast in the center top of the triangle.  The other 3 try to make what seem to be a other triangle to me facing to the west ( none in this formation where blinking) later these appeared to form in to one orb..  And the other three where just hanging around watching.  Mind you it was cloudy and raining last night. But some of the orbs shined thru the clouds.

I was in my first year of working for the hospital.  I was working the night shift between 4 PM and midnight on the above estimated date and time. I had pulled my patrol car over to make an entry into my daily activity log.  It was a clear summer night with not one cloud in sight.  Airport traffic was coming in from the north to north west area and landing in from the east of the airport at sky Harbor international Airport. I am an aviation enthusiast and sometimes I look up into the sky to look at aircraft as they fly by.  I noticed in America West Airlines Boeing 737 fly into Skyharbor from north west of Phoenix.  I had pulled my vehicle over facing north along 10 Street and Brill Street which is located just south of McDowell Road at the intersection of McDowell Road and 10 Street. For some reason I was fixed on the airplane flying over the building located on the southwest corner of 10th St. and McDowell Rd.  As it flew over I noticed the stars around the airplane were stationary.  I then noticed one star just to the 1 to 2 o'clock position of the aircraft when it suddenly shot towards the rear of the aircraft, then circled around behind your craft over to it's 9 o'clock position. It trailed and traveled with the aircraft in a parallel motion tracking and pacing the aircraft for approximately 1 to 2 seconds and then it faded and disappeared.  As I recall, the star or the UFO was constantly illuminated and looked like a star and at no time did it appear.  It looked like it was just sitting there stationary the whole time waiting for the aircraft to fly by. And that was the end of the UFO encounter.

I was driving back to my job in Tucson on Sunday night, (03/15/2009) from visiting my wife in Ontario, California.  I was driving on I-10 just south of Phoenix, east of South Mountain.   I saw the stars being blacked out by something huge (UFO) moving in the air.  A big rig truck a lane or two to the right slowed down and the driver leans forward to look up through his windshield.  Other drivers also slow down and look up.   I take my foot off of the accelerator to look up through the large front windshield of my 1983 Toyota Supra and see something big, black, slow and silent, couldn\u2019t hear anything but the road noise of the cars and trucks on the freeway.  This \u201cUFO\u201d was moving from behind me (North) in a South-East direction.   I then noticed a small flare, bottle rocket or meteorite come from above the huge UFO and hit the leading edge of the left wing and break up into many small pieces.  It really looked like a lit meteorite hitting the leading edge of the left \u201cwing\u201d and then brea! king into many lit pieces.  I thought this was very strange that a meteorite would just happen to fall to hit this very unusual object as it glided over, a strange coincident indeed.   I was driving about 70-75 mph in that stretch of the freeway and the object was moving slightly faster over me in a Southeast direction.  I then thought the object which hit the UFO could have been a bottle rocked but I thought again about this because when it hit, it sounded like a pebble hitting something made of metal because it made a slight ringing sound.  I remained uncertain as to what I had observed as I completed my drive home to Tucson. The next day the incident was all over the papers but I still didn\u2019t make the connection to what I saw because when I saw the UFO I didn\u2019t see any Lights other than the \u201cmeteorite\u201d which broke up when it hit the left \u201cwing\u201d and shatter into lit pieces.  The UFO was totally black, blocking out the stars as it passed but seemed to be slightly illuminated by the city lights below. Years later, I read people accounts stating that they felt no fear.  I recall that I also did not feel fear but more curiosity and confusion, like, \"What Is That???\" I\u2019ve seen large planes up close before, B-52, B-747, C-5, Hughes Aircraft Co.\u2019s Spruce Goose, and the Space Shuttle, etc.  None can compare.",

DOGS WERE HOWLING FOR FIRST TIME-19:06 12/10/13 At 7:06 p.m., I was sitting outside at our home in Laveen (SW Phoenix) and letting my dog play.  I was in the backyard where we have full view of high skies and much flight activity as close to Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport and Air Force Bases. I was standing and an enormous and brilliantly white in color light caught my eye as the it seemed to literally fall from the sky and quick over the house and neighborhood and then to the ground. It came from what appeared to be the North and East direction (saw as quick came over roof of home) and the immense and very intense bright white light dropped in the just near South and just East or possibly just Southerly direction.  The area where it flew over seemed to be almost right above the front of our home and heading rapidly towards the ground and South Mountain part.  The bright light was very intense and large and \"appeared\" too close to be real.  We did NOT hear any explosion or landing noise.  We did, for the very first time we've lived here, hear dogs HOWLING. It was so large that clearly others have seen and will report.  I had thought to call 911 but thought I could not really tell them what it was or where it landed. I have seen meteor shower and stars falling.  They burn out quickly and don't appear to ever be lower than the very busy aircraft that are constantly in the air.  The Airport closest is about 10 miles due East and we see departures and arriving flights around the clock, along with military craft performing maneuvers and plenty of high altitude large craft mostly coming from the West or likely California and passing far above the local traffic.  This was in a fairly spherical shape but the light was SO BRIGHT and SO WHITE that it seemed like it may have been very large-nothing I have ever seen in 40 years.  I've never reported anything like this, never have seen anything like this and hope that you and others can locate where this landed and hopefully it didn't land or crash in a populated area.  It's too early online to see comments from NEWS, etc.  But MANY private and commercial craft were in the air at this time.  This was far below even where helicopters fly.  Thanks for listening.

My husband and I were traveling south on the west side 101 Freeway at Glendale Avenue.  There is a large building on 99th Avenue south of Glendale Avenue.  It was dusk outside and the sun had just set behind the White Tank Mountains.  My husband pointed out the building with 3 large orange/red orbs stacked over the top of the building.  They were glowing and my husband asked if there were any airplanes that fly over that building because it looked like one of those large poles with lights on it that warn airplanes. Glendale airport it just north of this area, but this building is right next to the 101 freeway and no planes would be flying that close and low over the freeway.  I was trying to get my phone on to take pictures, when the lights starting glowing even brighter and getting larger and as we watched they just disappeared. My husband got off the freeway and we drove over to the building to see if there was a light pole in the property or even close to it.  There was none.  It was completely dark by then and we went up 99th avenue and got back on the 101 freeway, southbound again.  The orbs were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time.  PD))",

I went in to get a camera and while inside my son saw a second one pass by, slightly farther away.   As it passed by it dropped off a smaller version of itself, that slowly descended to the ground. Only my son saw this one as it was a distant dot by the time I got out.  But right at that time, a third orb approached from the northwest again, on about the same path, but closer than the first two.  This one was less than 1/8 mile away, and you could clearly make out the slightly egg-shaped form, again glowing orange, looking like a small sun.  The speed was again probably 75 mph, maybe a bit more this time.   My wife also witnessed this object.  There were multiple normal aircraft small and large visible in the sky at the time.   Fumbling with my camera in the dark I didn't get it focused and taking pictures until it was well over a mile away, but using the zoom feature, I got four decent pictures.  The image I will attach is a collage of those four pictures, reading in chronological order from top left, to top right, to bottom left, to bottom right.   There was a slight greenish color to the bottom of the orb by the time I got the last picture.  All objects moved silently past.",

      "story": "20+ft diameter clear crystalline sphere traveling slowly and silently a few hundred ft above and parallel to ground It was a clear night, and I had just arrived home from church and wanted to stay outside and enjoy the night air.  I dropped the truck tailgate down and sat on it looking westward enjoying the quiet clear night before heading inside for good. I was just basically staring straight ahead across the road over miles of vacant land and not up into the sky.  Not too long a time went by when I spotted an object moving toward me from a mile or so away.  It was traveling parallel to the ground and not more than a few hundred feet above the ground.  It got larger, naturally, as it came closer to me.  (It did not change size. It was just getting nearer and nearer.)  I hopped down off the tailgate and stood watching it get closer and closer.  I was definitely not expecting to see what I saw. This object was clear like crystal glass and spherical.  It looked like a crystalline golf ball in that its entire surface had concave circular \u201cdivets\u201call over it just like a golf ball.  I could see inside a black structure spanning about the center third of the sphere. The top of this black structure was probably a bit more than half the internal height of the sphere. Below the black structure was a brown structure that touched the black structure and was the same width.  It is hard to estimate the size of the sphere.  This was no star pinprick of a light in the sky.  This was probably a minimum of twenty feet in diameter and just a few hundred feet above me. I slowly raised my head up as it passed and turned my body around to follow it towards the city of Phoenix.  This sphere made not a bit of noise, and it did not cause any air turbulence.   There was no harsh or bright light emanating from it.  The inside was illuminated, (that is how I saw the black and brown structures) but no bright spot that would indicate the source of light was evident.  The outside had like a hazy light around the sphere. No separate exterior light(s), but light that must have passed from inside the crystal sphere to the outside.  It was like the haze you see around a street light at night. My eyes followed it until I could see it not more.  I ran inside and turned on the radio\u2026no news flash, etc.  My husband was watching  tv, and there was nothing on the tv about the object. I never heard anything about it. I have looked on the internet concerning spherical ufos and have found nothing similar to what I saw.  I came across this site tonight, hesitated, but then thought maybe someone else did see it  or one like it and hadn\u2019t responded either. It was real, and makes me wonder what our government really has knowledge/ability to do.  I know what I saw, and there will never be an denying it. I am 67 now and saw this when about 32 years old.  I was a school teacher at the time and just retired two years ago from 25 years of teaching mainly science at a Texas junior high/middle school. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I was trying to fix the event time on a report I just sent in and clicked on what ended up getting me to your home page.  I couldn't find a way back to the report to try to fix it again. The event time should have been 20:30.  It was about 8:30 at night, and I think I converted the event time incorrectly.  Sorry.

It would morph into a cylinder light.  I wonder if it were moving around or spinning.  It would get long and thin and then become round again. It would pulsate also when we were talking so it looked like the lights were blinking in it.  It was difficult to get an exact shape.  It split a couple of times or appeared to.  It moved up and over to the right as we walked the dog around.   We went back inside as I wanted to share this with you.  It was almost like a living entity, like it responded.

As it turned I was looking for a strobe light like on a plane, there was nothing no noise either, then as it turned to the west holding its altitude of maybe 3-4 thousand feet,  the flickering fire looking light turned to a more solid appearing orange-yellow light.  I ran into the house to get my binoculars as quick as I could. As I came out the the object was farther away still going west, then it appeared to just nose dive and went out of site, a few seconds later I saw a second orange flickering light object farther away to the southwest towards downtown phoenix flying level for a few seconds and it too nose dived out of sight. The third object came  approx. 20 seconds later with the same flight path as the first one.  And  again where the first one turned, this one did as well at the same altitude.  This time having the binoculars I started to look for it.   As it turned away, I saw it, either it was oval  or round  being in a banking turn and out the back end of it where several maybe 6-8 equally spaced bright solid yellowish lights where the back end of it would be.  I had a good eyeball on it as it turned, then all of a sudden those lights I was looking at out the back of it went dark, yet I was still panning on a dark object in the sky afterwards for a few seconds more.",

Then it slowed and switched directions and headed north.  I noticed that it was very visible with polarized sunglass but barely visible without.  It started moving north and ascending in altitude.   At that point I got out of my car and approached someone leaving the diner and asked them if they could see it.  He could not see anything but I could see it with my polarized glasses.   I took two photos.  I deleted the first as I noticed my iPhone camera could not detect the object.  The second one I kept to bring home and see if could indeed pull it out with some enhan! cement.  I was able to actually see a faint point of light in the photograph.   The object must have been highly reflective being that I couldn't spot it hardly at all until I viewed it through polarized lenses.

The object appeared through the glasses (red lenses for night viewing, no distortion) to consist of a center with 4 arms extending from it, like a cross.  The center was where the flickering colored lights appeared.   The colors changed rapidly but I was able to discern at least red, blue, green and either yellow or white.

I pulled off and went into the neighborhood to take a look and see what they were to find that they were free moving objects slowly heading south easterly.

They were low and holding elavation. As soon as the first one got in what would have been almost right over the airport.  We could see what looked like a cloth or shading extend out and fold over the bottom.  Which darkened it from all sides and made the bottom appear to match the stars at a much further distance.  Fortunately we have a lot of smoke looming over the city from a mulch fire which made the shadings visible slightly enough too see it eventually disappearing from view.  As soon as the first one went out the other two followed.  They picked up speed and were gone in seconds. Suddenly another one appears.

I observed it for approx. 15 \u2013 20 seconds.  The orange object was not flickering or flashing but the all of a sudden the light went out and I could still see a dark image for a brief moment  and then it disappeared. Approx. 30 -45 seconds later I observed a second object with the same description as the first traveling the same trajectory.. Then the orange light went out about 15 \u2013 20 seconds later and  I could not see the object afterwards. I then ran into the house and got my cell phone camera. Again, approx. 15  seconds later I observed a 3rd object, same as the first two traveling the same course and manner. I recorded this object on my cell phone and again the light went out and again I could see the object briefly but I could not see the shape or where it disappeared to. The weather was clear and the temperature was approx. 70 -75 degrees at the time. I did not see any aircraft in the area. It should be noted that Luke AFB is located approx. 20 miles to the southwest of my location and the F-16\u2019s usually do night training from about 2100 \u2013 2230 hours and you could see and hear them but there were no military aircraft at the time of my observations.

Mountain.   When I looked out my window I saw what appeared to be a group of at least six separate very bright red, with light flashing, flickering objects, that basically looked like they were hovering, but then would move in different directions sporadically, flash, and then the lights would disappear and would reappear,again.  My first thought that they were commercial jets taking off from Sky Harbor or landing at the airport.  But, they (the unidentified objects) were stationary, hovering and the movement clearly wasn't any jet aircraft.   My only other thoughts were that they may have been a lot of helicopters,possibly hovering over an accident on the freeway area.   I alerted my adult daughter to go out into the backyard to see what she thought, and she thought initially maybe it was jet aircraft, but then came to the same conclusion that the ! objects were hovering, flashing off and on, and the movement couldn't be that of any commercial aircraft either.   After about 10 minutes of continued watching the objects, it got dim and then the objects just disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))",

At first I figured it was a planet but when I saw it I saw it was much too bright and was slowly moving across the sky.   Very slowly it started moving toward the horizon, so slow that we almost couldn\u2019t tell it was moving, believing it to be our eyes playing tricks on us.  It was very bright, and my brother swore that he saw it shoot up towards the sky which is how it caught his attention in the first place.   We continued to just observe whatever this thing was over the next half hour or so, even climbing on the roof to get a better view.  We had each commented on how the object seemed to be varying in luminosity and to have shown little specks of red blink occasionally.  Again, I must emphasize that it *seemed* to do these thing because we were all staring at it so long that it could very well have been our eyes playing tricks on us.    As we were watching, we noticed that it had slowly shifted its color from a bright, almost star-like, white glow into a deep orange and yellow.  This was for certain, there was no way it was an illusion caused by focusing on something so bright for so long.  Remember, all of this happened over the span of around thirty minutes so the changes were subtle except for the eventual change in color.  It continued to float down towards the horizon and slightly towards what would be north from our perspective.  My brother grabbed his Iphone to use his Starmap app to verify that it was not a planet or star.  It was WAY bigger than anything else I had ever seen, that I suspected was not an aircraft seeing as it was so steady and \u201cfloaty\u201d.  One last thing that we remarked on was the fact that it often looked as if it partially blended with the sky.  We thought it could have been something blocking our view but it was only a part of the object at any one time and whenever this occurred the (I want to say distortion) was the exact color of the sky behind it.  It was definitely one of the strangest things I have ever seen.   I do live near both an airforce base and a major airport if that is at all relevant.",

Prior to this, and for several minutes, I noticed a pattern of whitish-yellow lights in line formation, with slight variations in altitudes, in the relative proximity of South Mountain.  They were visible for at least 40NM. Prior to hearing the radio traffic, I was under the impression I was seeing very bright lights coming from atop the mountain, as I knew there were horseback riding trails in the area.  I can account for seeing five lights as I remember they formed a shallow W-pattern similar to the form of the Chair of Cassiopeia, however this was in the southern sky and appeared below our altitude. ATC radio inquired if we saw the lights, which we acknowledged, and it was overheard that the lights were visible from other aircraft and from the ground. We turned to the north for an approach into Luke AFB and upon completion of that approach, turning toward the south, the lights were no longer visible. In later years, I was informed they were probably flares in the MOA to the south of Phoenix, however, I am familiar with air-dropped illumination flares, and although there are similar characteristics, these did not appear the same. This information is extracted from my log-book. ((NUFORC Note:  Reported by a military navigator.  PD))",

      "story": "Object like uprooted tree drifting over Arizona desert I am reporting this event that occurred 18 years ago, only because it was so highly unusual.  I am sure of the date and time, as it was the 4th of July, and my brother and I were living in Phoenix at the time.  We had decided to go to a small desert park near Camelback Mountain, climb some rocks and watch the fireworks in the city below.   We parked at a dead end street and were walking toward the desert when I noticed an odd thing in the sky, moving rather slowly.  It was nearing dusk and the sky was cloudless.  The item was dark and had an irregular shape.   I pointed it out to my brother and he quickly went back to his truck to get a pair of binoculars that he always carried with him.  We estimated that it was about 800 feet above the ground, and it was moving south to north, very smoothly, as if propelled in some manner (not moving erratically or intermittently as a balloon might do).  If it was at the estimated height of 800 feet then we guessed that it might have! been from 10 to 12 feet in diameter.   We each got a good look at it in the binoculars, and it appeared to be nothing so much as an uprooted tree with roots dangling below.  There was some kind of rotating platform on the upper portion of the \u201ctree roots,\u201d and some kind of a weird-looking appendage that stuck out of the top of the rotating platform.  The appendage was very thin and slightly curved, and appeared to be dangling something over the side of the rotating platform.   Astonished, we stopped two passers-by who were also heading into the rock formations and pointed out the bizarre thing in the sky.  They took a look at it through the binoculars as well, made a comment about how odd it was (I guess!) and then strolled off.   We stood and watched the thing disappear over the mountains into the darkening sky, total time of sighting was approximately 10 minutes.  There were no lights on it, and it made no sound.   Later that night my brother and I agreed to separately draw what we had seen and compare the pictures.  It was clear that we did see the same thing.  We have no idea what it was.  My brother has since passed on but he was an astronomy major in college, and I had spent six years in the military.  We were both over 40 years old at the time of the sighting.   We considered all possibilities, but could not even venture a guess as to how such a thing could be hoaxed.  Since that time, I\u2019ve heard about the \u201cjellyfish\u201d UFOs and have wondered if that is what it was.   Since we expected to be spending time in the dark outside, we had no camera with us and this was long before the cell phone age, unfortunately.   I just wanted to mention this event which we did not report at the time, in case anyone else has seen something similar and would like to know if others have had the experience. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Mr. Davenport,  thank you so much for noticing my report.  My brother who was with me at the time passed on in Florida in 2009 and many of his effects were boxed and given to friends, so I don't have his original drawing, and I have moved so many times since then, that I'm sure I have no idea where mine went.  I could certainly re-draw it, however.  It's not a thing I'm ever going to forget. I've been a Coast listener for many years, but it never occurred to me to report my sighting, until I recently heard you mention that you were interested in past reports, as well as new ones.   I was visiting your site for the first time this past weekend and reading mostly about the Washington reports since I live here now.  I went to Arizona's listings too and checked around the date of my sighting and saw there were some reports from that date in Arizona, but nothing very similar to mine.   Interesting that you mentioned Mars, by the way -- I've always been particularly fascinated by that planet and have been following Curiosity's progress toward Mt. Sharp over the last few years.  I also spend a lot of time on Google Mars just roaming around to see what they will allow us to see, and I never get tired of that.  I can't wait until we have Google Venus and Google Saturn, etc.!  I was impressed to find that the dates of your collected reports went back so far.  What a great resource for researchers.  Now that I'm familiar with your site, I'll check it often, and be sure to add my own sightings, should I have any more in the future.  Kudos for all the very hard work you must do to keep it organized and available to everybody. Again, I'll be glad to redraw the UFO I saw.  I do have a cell phone available so I can send a pic through email or as a phone message attachment, or I can just snail-mail it to you if you like.  Let me know how you'd prefer to receive it. Thank you, once more for all that you do and especially how you share it so freely with all of us. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

As I approached the Ahwatukee area entering onto Pecos Rd it became clear these 4 lights were far off in the distance near the southern tip of the Estrella Mountain Range.  I have witness these UFO's before back in the late 90's with father, very similar in fashion to the famous \"Phoenix Lights.\"  I see planes come and go every night, and I know what their landing lights look like.  These were much brighter and far larger in their radiant glow.  It appeared to me that they were even gaining altitude.   I lost sight of them as I went under the I-10 interchange.  When I came out the other side past Pecos Park I caught a glimpse of them right as they blinked out of existence separately, but rapidly in succession.  Some background info: I am an avid aerospace enthusiast and have flown several air craft myself.  But I am not a licensed pilot.   My father, who did not witness these, but the previous ones in the 90's, said he had seen nothing like it.  He is an aerospace tech who works on jet engines and was a former aircraft mechanic in the U.S. Air Force.  Commonly our local Luke Air Force base claims these lights are flares from the fighters performing bombing runs at the Barry Goldwater Range.  While this is a large range its no where near the location of these lights.",

On Friday, July 3rd, 2015, at 9:20pm, as I was leaving the Nice-n-Easy parking lot in Phoenix, NY, I saw a stationary object in the southern sky above St. Stephen\u2019s Church.  I extended my left arm toward the object and raised my thumb as a reference for size.  This object was the size of my thumbnail.  I estimated it to be approximately eight hundred feet above the ground.  I based this estimate on the objects location in relation to the peak of St Stevens Church below it, and the cumulus cloud cover behind it.  I would describe this object as a ball of light.  It was bright red, and twinkled orange to yellow at its core.  I had determined at this point it was not an airplane, helicopter, drone, or fire work flare.  It was stationary.  There was no sound associated with the object. I drove out of the parking lot on to Culver Street and traveled west intending to cross the bridge to lock island.  I continued to view the object.  I slowed down in order to observe the object for three or four seconds at a glance.  The object was now moving west parallel to my line of travel.  It had matched my speed of fifteen miles an hour and was visible at sixty degrees to my left as I traveled South West.  While I was on the bridge I again compared the object to the landscape and my thumb nail.  The cumulus cloud cover remained a reliable reference in the background.  It was now just above the trees located in the area of the old paper mill.  I estimated the object to be approximately two hundred feet above the ground.  Its size was still consistent with my thumbnail. I continued on Lamson Road and turned onto Pendegast Road. After traveling only a short distance, I pulled to the side of the road.  The object was behind me.  I stepped out of my truck.  At this point the object passed very close to me, approximately fifteen degrees off my zenith.  As the object moved in front of me I began to record it on my cell phone.  It was now in front of me traveling in a Northwest direction.  The object climbed steadily and maintained a trajectory of approximately sixty degrees above the horizon. The length of my recording was forty-one seconds. The time stamp of the recording was 20150707_213513.  I estimate the entire event lasted approximately fifteen minutes. If you have questions please contact me I would be happy to talk with you.",

The object seemed to be the size of a large house or larger.  It was not illuminated (and appeared dark in color with some irregular features that seemed to reflect light) but seemed to be a large creature of some sort (resembling a beetle as seen from below).   It also appeared to resemble a dark colored octopus as seen from below, but with tentacles much shorter (each only a quarter the thickness of its body) and more wirery than those on an octopus.  The \u2018tentacles\u2019  (approximately ten or twenty located around its periphery), in fact were more like the cilia of a cell seen under a microscope.  These \u2018cilia\u2019, flagellated and shivered rapidly as if being rapidly blown by an erratic wind, yet the sky was very still (with no wind) and the object made no noise that I could hear (as a loud commercial jet was taking off from a nearby airport the moment I awoke).  The object had a highly organic look, as if it were a creature (maybe a large bug) of some type.   After I\u2019d watched it approach for about two seconds, I yelled thinking that it may crash into me.  The moment I yelled, it abruptly changed direction (without slowing down) and began moving away and to my right.  As it ascended to the right and away from me, it slowly faded away and vanished.

While looking up at the night sky and laying on my back, relaxing close to where I sleep outside near sky harbor airport, I noticed a flash in the sky.  The flash resembled a star coming into existence suddenly, and then disappearing, just as suddenly (within a fraction of a second).  This caught my attention as I have seen strange lights in the sky two years previously, when I lived in San Diego, California (USA). I then noticed two orange orbs, which I initially though were balloons, floating side by side next to each other heading in a southerly direction.  No moon was out, so the orbs seemed to be self-luminous with a soft orange glow.  The orbs flew directly overhead and then drifted out of sight. Regarding size, the orbs appeared to be, if looking at the back of an outstretched hand facing the sky, a quarter of the size of the pinky nail.  As they moved, they seemed to have a slightly wobbly motion, as if they were balloons.  A local dog began barking when the orbs flew over. Keeping my eyes trained at the sky, I then noticed stars moving.  First one, then another, then a third and fourth over a period of about an hour.  One of the stars seemed to strobe brightly for a time (five seconds) and then its light dimmed. It continued to fly and then seemed to vanish prematurely, before one might expect it to fade away due to distance.  Two or three other stars approached my position on the ground, as I lay on my back looking at the sky, and disappeared suddenly when they were in a position directly overhead of my position.  Two of the stars flew together, although not in formation, within my field of view before one vanished.  Then the other.",

      "story": "Seriously Close Encounter!!!!!! Myself and my two roommates were sitting on our front porch, when I saw what i thought was a star at first.  It started swaying back and forth from side to side slowly.  As it got closer to the ground it quit swaying, and my roommates noticed what ever it was flying directly towards us from straight ahead of us but up in the sky.  As it got close enough for us to hear the flying craft, we could hear a high pitch turbine engine sound radiating from the craft that came to a complete stop above my neighbors house in the middle of the night.  My roommates and I all stood and I asked if they saw that thing too.  They said yes.   The craft was obviously as interested in us as we were of it.  I looked around at my other neighbors houses to see if anybody was coming out to see what this loud noise was coming from this craft now hovering motionless above my neighbors house.  Nobody came out.  We all three started walking to our driveway and out to the street.  As we did that ,th! e craft became silent and I could not hear any noise.  We all three kept our eyes glued to the mysterious craft that just floated down from the dark sky.  As we walked towards the street , the craft came towards us but parallel so that we didn't end up directly underneath it when we met in the middle of the street.  The craft then hovered silently about 15 feet above us and ten feet away so weren't directly underneath it.  We all three staired at the hovering craft for what seems like a long time and I felt tired, but only about 13 min passed.  All three of us seemed to be in a trance like state staring at the craft as it started to float silently away from us down our street at the same altitude it was checking us out at.  Whoever was piloting the craft that was about half as big as my neighbors house, that it first hovered over, was just as curious about us as we were about this craft.  We watched it float away down our street after what felt like hours, but almost no time had! passed.  The craft made it about 3/4 of the way down the street and then made a degree of a turn over 90\u00b0 smooth fluidly and effortlessly back towards where it originally flew down from up with all the stars.  It flew as effortlessly and slow going back up that it did coming down.  Except it flew in more of a straight pattern going back up.  When it was to small to distinguish the craft from a star I blinked and looked around my street ,sighing when I realized nobody was watching us.  Then I noticed my roommates were still in a trance staring at the sky in the middle of our street at 2:30 in the morning.  Then I said hey guys let's get out of the street before someone thinks we're crazy or something.  The craft did not have bright lights emanating from the bottom, but it did have some lights flashing colors in the fusilage area that sat in the middle of the saucer craft.  I have never seen or experienced this kind of thing before or after in my entire life.  As the craft was flying away slowly like it didn't have a care in the world, I thought to myself how insignificant we really are and those things can do what they want and we probly can't stop them.  When then craft was observing us close I could have hit it with a rock it was so close.  The air had a strange smell also while it was close. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

On the top of the aircraft were two attached but, different lights.  (On the left: a red slower flashing light & on the right: a faster blinking bluish light). The aircraft was triangular in shape & the only way I can actually describe it as I witnessed it, is:  Push all of your fingers outward on your left or right hand, (as far as you can), and imagine it filled in by a darker beige color, with the front lights in between each finger.

You would see what appears as a tiny ball of light. This object traveled from the west and to the east at a high rate of speed, much greater than anything I've seen before.

It traveled faster than normal civilian aircraft we see above altitude to me looked at least 10,000 feet.  Granted we see all types of aircraft fly over our building due to us being in the flight path of aircraft taking off and landing at Phoenix sky harbor airport.  There was no noise when it flew over.  Tried to keep watching it but it flew out of sight due to building in the way.  Couple minutes later I looked again and the object was now west of us and it made a tight turn and vanished.  There was no reflection from the sun on this vehicle.  I really don't know what this was.  My coworker is a 20 year air force veteran with flight status who flew on the e-4b for a number of years.

I was standing in the covered porch and I saw a huge red object rising on the other side of my neighbors tree.  I saw the object through the tree branches.   I stepped out into the pool area moving across my decking so I could see the object with out the tree.  I was rising higher than the tree tops.  I thought it was coming from the airport.  It appeared as a fireball, it was not a plane.  I watch the planes fly over all the time.   As I watched a huge chunk of flame fell off and went towards the ground.  It burnt up and was no longer visible.  Then a smaller portion broke off and did the same thing as the first larger piece.  The size of the fireball did not appear to change even though two pieces had fallen off.   The fireball rose higher then completely disappeared.  It did not fall to the ground, it simply disappeared.  I logically thought it was a plane crash.  There was a plane from Sky Harbor that was heading opposite of SW and was climbing into the clouds.  This was absolutely a plane.  A pilot would have been able to see the object from their cockpit.   I called a local news company and there were no sightings or reports.  This was not a meteor, or a shooting star.  Those items are very easy to distinguish and identify.  Has anyone else seen the object this evening?  If so what was it?   My cell phone was in the house.  If I'd gone to get it I would have missed the display. A cell camera would not have given a good photo, the object was not near enough, it would have just looked like a light rather than a fireball.",

      "story": "Large rectangle object making no noise. I saw this object so many years ago and the year and month are correct, but the day could be off it was sometime around the first half of the month. I was in my backyard, looking at the sky.  The night was calm and quiet, the sky was partly cloudy (but the clouds were sitting lower than normal at approximately 7000 to 8000 feet),  and no planes were in the area.  I lived approximately 8 or so miles east from Luke AFB. At about 2015 hours or so, I noticed blue lights, lighting up a large cloud to the south of my house.  The blue color that I can describe is like a welders blue light a bright dark blue color.  This light appeared from the cloud about 2 to 3 times in a short period of time.  The light looked to be coming out of the cloud but there was no visible beam to it, so I was not sure if it was making it to the ground.  Oddly enough on the final light flash, I did here someone yell to the south of me about a light flash, but I don't know if this was related. After that, approximately 30 or so seconds later a large rectangle object came out of this cloud slowly , but increase speed quickly.  The object had many sets of lights all over the haul and there were no viable wings on it.  The objects structure looked metallic bluish-gray in color.  The object made zero noise.  At the speed it was traveling and the size of the object not hearing any sound from it made the sighting very uneasy. The object traveled through a few more clouds and went west heading towards Luke AFB, but ended up shooting up into the sky and almost vanishing in seconds. a few minutes after I lost track of the object, I smell something similar to burning electronics or something like that and my eye became a little irritated.  I am not sure if this was related or if a neighbor was doing something funny. The size of the object is hard to explain.  The size of the object was something I could never think that could fly, a specially with no wings nor making a sound. Being retired career military and having clearances.  I have very good knowledge of military aircraft both known and kept secret, long with civilian aircraft.  I have no clue what this is or was..  this was tattooed to my brain that night.  I only now come forward because  my story should be told.  I never saw another object in the sky after that but this was enough for me.",

Time of sighting: 6:38pm mountain time   Duration of sighting:  Six Minutes   Location: South Mountain Look Out nearest Radio/TV \u2013 Gila Valley Look Out   My girlfriend and I drove to the top of the mountain to view the sunset as it almost completely dropped behind the mountains due west.  The temperature had dropped down to 71 degrees and the wind was blowing east by southeast 10mph (you can hear it in the footage).  As my girlfriend and I were turning towards our car she stopped and pointed. I turned and looked to find four lights hovering past or behind the Estrella Mountains level with the mountain tops, in front of the visible cloud streaks to the southwest.  They were reddish, amber, gold color.   At first, I thought they were typical airline traffic approaching due east to land at Sky Harbor International Airport.  But these lights hovered\u2014almost flickering\u2014maintaining their position.  We could not determine if they were balls of fire, or that the space between us and the objects seemed to flicker because of the atmospheric particles between us and the lights.   Then, to the left, a reverse C crescent formation of seven lights a! ppeared roughly two minutes later.  Then, a single light appeared below the crescent\u2014that is when my girlfriend began recording.  At this point there were 11 visible glowing objects.  One minute into the video, you will see the camera pan left where another light formed and immediately to the left of that light, two comet-like streaks passed to the left\u2014they were visible for 10 seconds before they faded out.   The remaining lights stayed in position\u2014unaffected by the present wind--keeping formation, for another two minutes before fading away.  The first four lights appeared for four minutes.  The crescent group of seven appeared for 4 minutes and the two streaks lasted 10 seconds.   We held our position for five minutes after the lights disappeared.  No lights appeared thereafter.

I was traveling northbound on Hwy 87, just past Fort McDowell Casino and I spotted 4 lights in a row, as I was looking northwest.  These lights were bright white in front and flashing red lights from side to rear.  After I passed and looked back they were no longer visible, however there were several more ahead of me. While driving, I noticed several vehicles pulled over and people standing on the side of the road staring at the objects which drew my curiosity to watch these lights closer. At first, I assumed they were planes but as I got closer I noticed that the lights seem to break off and stretched for miles of approx. 12-15 bright lights in a straight line. Roughly 200 ft. west of Hwy 87 and approx. 500 feet above ground. I didn\u2019t become suspicious until about the 6th light that I passed, I then pulled over about a mile before Bush Hwy exit and got out of vehicle, it was very quiet, no sound and objects remained very still, hovering.  I tried to capture a picture but it only looked like a bright dot (crappy cell phone camera). After approx. 5 minutes of watching these objects remain motionless, thoughts began to run through my head, as I was trying to rationalize what these were, drones, planes, or military crafts etc. My only logical conclusion was UFO\u2019s which prompted me to get back into the vehicle and drive away, heading northbound on highway 87. While driving past the Sugar-loaf/4 Peaks turn off, I spotted several other lights hovering east and west of the highway.  There was 2 remaining lights in front of me.  After I passed the second light, I didn\u2019t see any more and that concludes my sighting.",

There were monsoon clouds in the distance, but something closer caught my eye as I was waiting.  This \"cloud\" was unusually bright--white.  I looked at it and realized that it wasn't a cloud--it was too small in the foreground, very white/illuminated, and had a very distinctive (not blurry around the ends like a cloud) shape.  The light was shaped like a skinny oval.  From the top, the oval wasn't flat but graduated up towards the center about 15 degrees.  Suddenly, from each end a beam of a similar bright light (thin like a string) shot out at the same time then this \"shape\" shot straight up and was gone.",

Please review the show of \"American Monster \" S1 / E5 \"Shooting Phoenix\"   This show has absolutely nothing to do with UFO sightings, but around 40 to 45 minutes in the hour long show there is a scene that is suppose to be a night view of the skyline somewhere over Phoenix, Arizona.  I noticed as I was watching the show an unexplained occurrence with a fast traveling light coming from the left right above the city lights at an extremely fast speed compared to the traffic on the highway below it traveled quickly towards the right of the tv screen then came to an abrupt stop and dropped to the road level slowly did a complete 360 and traveled back towards the left at a southwest angle.  I and several others have watched this footage over and over the only explanation we can figure out is that it could truly be a sighting! Granted I know that only the producers and editors of this show know when and where this footage they used was really captur! ed on tape and was used at this particular time on the making of Season One / Episode Five of \"American Monster.

      "story": "3 Moving Lights with Large Trails in Phoenix form a Triangle in the Night Sky Lights Over Phoenix, AZ July 2nd, 2016 9:03 PM \tI was sitting on my patio in south Scottsdale near Oldtown, when I heard a loud bang.  As I looked up towards the North West I noticed the 3 objects falling in unison.  I first thought that maybe 2 aircrafts had collided in the sky and these objects were falling debris on fire.  I started to record a video and as doing so the trailing lighted objects proceeded to move along different flight patterns, even turning and changing direction.  The altitude was way too high to be fireworks and the patterns of the lights made me think about potential rockets or missiles.  However, rockets and missiles move at a much larger rate of speed.  I\u2019m a veteran of the U.S. Army that worked in avionics and with the knowledge I have over the Hellfire missile there\u2019s little that relates for it to be classified as such.  There is a lot I still do not know on the subject though.  Nothing as far as I can tell makes any sense. \tI\u2019m an avid reader of science-fiction and do believe in the possibility of many lifeforms in the universe, even intelligent life.  This is the only experience I\u2019ve had first hand. Towards the end of my recording my roommate happens to come out and witness the lights and their maneuvers through the sky as well.  I would describe the lights to have a yellowish tint and large sparking trails following them.  Around the 40 second mark you\u2019ll see the bottom light start to change directions more rapidly than the rest of the video with clear visibility of the trail of light behind it.  Then around the 1:01 mark all 3 lights come back and form a triangular shape in the sky.  Excuse my language in the commentary at this point too. \tLike I have stated this is my first experience with something I believe to be supernatural and I\u2019m not sure if all the information you need is provided.  If there are any questions or need any follow up I\u2019m more than happy to help. I immediately uploaded my video to social media, but for ease of access here is the link to the video I\u2019ve now posted to Youtube.  https://youtu.be/wVpXssN0VK0  \tThank you for your time.

I have never in my life seen anything fly like this.  It was definitely NOT man made.  This UFO seemed to be scanning or taking pictures of something near my backyard.   After it flashed red lights a few times, it just zoomed away heading west, till I could not see it anymore.   This thing made NO SOUND WHATSOEVER!  Did anyone one else see it/them?

And in others a light blue with green which is very puzzling.  One other thing to mention is normally a light or object is picked up much easier on my phone while recording video opposed to shooting a picture.

On 11/11/2016 at approximately 6:50pm MST, I was aboard Southwest Airlines flight 422 (Boeing 727-700) from Phoenix, AZ to Sacramento, CA.  About 15-20 minutes after the flight left Phoenix at 6:30pm MST, a bright light appeared on the left side of the aircraft.  According to the flight parameters available via the onboard Wi-Fi, the plane was flying at 528 mph (ground speed) and ay 38000 ft.  The light appeared off the left side of the aircraft and appeared to be about 1,000 feet away.  The light would move up and down vertically throughout most of the flight.  Even as the plane adjusted course, the light did not vary.  Other stars in the background appeared to move as the plane headed towards Sacramento.  As the plane descended for landing and went through the cloud layers, the light faded in and out.  About 40 miles out from Sacramento, the light suddenly disappeared.",

Even so, this was very close to the ground and low flying, so whatever the 2 planes were following was extremely small with no identifying features - just like a fast moving star. Chase planes kept in formation as they went into a valley and over a hill and one of the planes started flashing a red beacon while the other did not. The dot of light they were following remained the same, appearing to slightly fade out at one point but then brighten again. Currently watching for any reports to see if anybody else saw this!",

      "story": "Mysterious object in the Phoenix sky. I live in Phoenix Arizona.  I am an adult male, never used drugs in my life, non alcohol user, no mental issues and of sound mind and body.  I am the type of person generally speaking that has to see something with my own eyes, see it, touch it, taste it, feel it or witness something to believe it when it comes to things of this nature.  I am just an average Joe with above average street smarts and intelligence in the game of life.  Arizona is known for having high visibility and fosters the type of environment where things can be seen from a distance. I have never in my life seen anything like I did On Friday October 21st 2016 approximately 10:50pm.  I saw something in the sky in the northern part of the skyline when I was taking out my trash to my dumpster.  What drew my attention to it was the light it emitted and how it moved.  The light was all one color and of a white light clear in nature.  This was a flying object in the sky that moved like nothing I have ever seen in my lifetime.  This was not something of commercial or military aircraft in nature.  If it was one of ours it was of discrete nature or kept very secret. I have seen stealth bombers and fighter jets in person and this was NOT one of those.  I have never in my life witnessed anything of this nature previously.  I used to laugh and have doubt at people that claimed to have seen things of this nature and were so adamant about it.  My opinion now has changed after what I witnessed. The way this thing moved laterally side to side was like nothing I have ever seen in my life.  I will never forget that aspect of it. It was THAT fast the horizontal/lateral movement was just unreal.  I stood and observed this thing in the sky for about 6 or seven minutes.  I saw one of our aircraft approach it.  I knew it was one of ours because it had red and blue lights and moved entirely different from how this thing moved.  When our aircraft approached it whatever it was I saw disappeared in an instant. I checked online and on the news and there was nothing about this reported that I am aware of.  Someone knows something about this as it was investigated by our aircraft approaching it.  Another piece of the puzzle is that Luke Air Force base is close to where I live and also we are really not that far from an installation known as Area 51.  What I saw was not something created by mankind.  Again, if it was it was something kept very discrete and secret.  That is all I have to say about it.",

As I closed my trucks back door, I noticed 3 very bright stars that were vertical of each other similar to orions belt, but perfectly straight up and down, and perfectly spaced apart from one another.  They were brighter than every star in the sky.  I thought this was very unusual, so I went back to my front door of my house and yelled for my wife to come out and look at this as well. We both came back to our driveway next to my truck, and I showed my wife the 3 stars.  As we looked at these 3 stars they had moved farther down from the sky, and they were now turning themselves off and on separately in order, like one two three, one two three, and they were definitely moving lower and further away in the sky. Although they were very high in the sky like where the stars are.  My wife could not explain them as well.  We watched them for a couple of minutes.  My wife went inside and I grabbed my phone and called the fox 10 news station and talked to a guy and told him what I was looking at. He said he would check into it. I then went to get our son from his room to show him as well.  He came outside within 1 minute or so and we all looked at the 3 stars/lights still staying in that same formation, but getting farther away and lower in the sky, but also maintaining the off and on sequence.  Our son couldn\u2019t explain what he was seeing as well.  This was know going on for approximately 7 to 10 minutes.  We all went inside to get our telescope, it took about 2 to 3 minutes to locate the lenses for the scope, and then we went back outside to see if we could center the telescope on the moving stars.  They were now a lot further away and lower in the sky, and getting very faint.  We couldn\u2019t lock the telescope onto the lights as they disappeared into night sky.  We stayed out a little longer to see if anything else in the sky was similar, but their was nothing else. When I first noticed the 3 stars/lights I was facing almost due west, and as they disappeared into the sky they all were at the northwest part of the sky.  The whole sighting lasted approximately 15 minutes, and throughout the entire time, all 3 objects maintained their exact spacing from one another and the exact order and timing of turning off and on.  They must have been very high in the sky, since the entire time they looked like stars in the sky except they were moving and turning off and on, and we\u2019re always in formation.",

I needed to ((use restroom)) first before I left the land fill, so I pulled off the haul road and got out of my truck ((deleted)) by the truck fuel tanks.   I was ((using toilet)) and I just looked straight up into the sky, while I was going, and I saw a incredible sight.  Right above me was a very strange looking contrail that was being produced but it was being produced so fast.  It was at a incredible speed.  WAY faster than Mach 9.6 or almost 7,000 mph.  I know most commercial planes fly about 500 miles a hour and produce contrails sometimes and you can see them because they fly so slow. Not this very odd contrail it was moving so fast it had to be 5 times faster than Mach 9.6 or almost 7,000 mph.  So I looked way ahead of the fast moving contrail and I saw it.  It was a black swept wing looking aircraft the size of a commercial craft like a 747 and the contrails that were coming out looked puffy and strange.  This craft was moving so fast FAST FAST it went from right above me to almost out of sight in less than a minute.  From one side of the sky to the other in 60 seconds or so.  Aircraft cannot fly that fast its impossible.   As it flew out of sight I saw two other contrails being produced bearing down on the fast contrail and you could see they were following the real fast contrail but could not keep up..

We said, ''no, what did you see?'' he said ''it was a light, i don't it was a shooting star it didn't leave a streak. but not only that....it was red and yellow.  We stared like it was pulling our leg.  suddenly we all saw the red and yellow craft which was a cigar shape.  After about 1 it went away.  The whole time the crafts were just sitting there and it almost seemed like they were spectating us.  We all went to bed thinking it was just military aircrafts. but here is where it gets interesting....one us (which was a teen girl) said she woke up and heard a rumbling sound in our backyard...she said that she looked out the window and stunned to see little eyes staring at her (directly at her).  she also said that that she saw an aircraft but it was very small.  It was only about 10 by 4 craft.  She ran to her bed and went under her covers and stayed there in till dawn.  She didn't sleep at all that night and said in the morning what she saw.  we went outside and we were shocked to see a lining of a large circle in the dirt.  In till then we all think it was maybe a UFO.  so that is why we came to you guys.   Please email me back as soon as you guys can, so i can and my family figure this mystery out.

      "story": "Diamond shaped crafts test my perception and direction following abilities. Having only been aware of the extraterrestrial presence for the past two weeks or so, I have been watching the night sky every chance I get.  On 4/09/2017 at approximately 23:00, I was sitting at the park and saw a bright white light hovering just above the trees on the eastern horizon.  The light was roughly the size of a street light, but the apparent distance indicates that the light originated from a larger source.  It was blinking but I'm not sure if was in a pattern.  Upon seeing this light, I was filled with a great sense of fear and felt an intense need to go home. After making it back home, I lied down outside to watch the sky some more. At approximately 01:00 on 04/10/2017 (later that same night) the craft reappeared, hovering above the trees on the southern horizon this time.  It was blinking at me the same way, as if testing to see if I was aware of their presence.  I froze, gazed fixed on the bright, blinking light, and suddenly it was gone.  I did not see it leave. Then on 04/14/2017 at approximately 22:00 the blinking light was back.  As soon as I noticed it, it flew away in a direction that was hard to see.  Shortly after, a craft with two solid white lights on the sides, a blinking white light at the front, and a blinking red light at the back made several passes over my house.  I concentrated on these crafts, as they could have been normal airplanes, but the positioning of the lights was unlike any plane that I have seen before.  The next pass (always from south to north) I held my arm up and thought the words \"Is that you?\"  A few minutes later three crafts passed overhead simultaneously. Two from a greater distance, with the two lights on the side and the blinking lights in the front and back, and another much closer.  The one that passed closer to me was diamond shaped, but didn't appear flat, almost like a prism with a glowing orange light in the middle and around the sides. At this point I decided to walk to the park to get a better view of the night sky.  In the distance I could see something hovering that would blink a white light on the left side and a red light on the right side.  I felt like it wanted me to follow it.  I went in the direction that I thought it wanted me to go, and waited for further instruction. I don't think that I followed their directions correctly at first, so I started walking in another direction when one of the larger crafts with the two white lights on the sides made a low pass above me.  I was able to see it more clearly. From below, it was diamond shaped with four smaller diamond shaped quadrants.  The sides where they has the two solid white lights could light up with green or red all across, so I think they were trying to imitate regular airplanes for camouflage purposes while remaining distinct so I could follow them. There would always be one hovering in the distance while the other would make passes above me.  After awhile, I noticed that both of the crafts would alter which direction was blinking white or red, as if to tell me to go in the direction of the white light. They led me a few blocks over, to a side street with a culdesac.  At this point it was around 23:30 and most houses were quiet, except for one.  The house at the end of the culdesac had the garage door open, light on, with a man sitting, seemingly waiting.  I hesitated, for I did not want to appear insane, walking up to a strangers house in the middle of the night with no logical explanation.  The blinking continued in the direction of the mans house, along with another pass from above.  I finally mustered the courage to approach the house, but the man was gone. I started walking home, still watching the sky. Getting closer to home, the crafts appeared to be trying to lead me once again. They brought me through the park, to a dark corner where there were few houses around.  I heard what sounded like two birds chirping at me from the trees, and walked around the area for a moment, looking for signs. The chirping sounded almost like the words, 'Over here,' and when I started to walk away, it changed to a panicked, 'Come back.'  I wasn't sure if my mind was playing tricks on me, but I went back.  Looked around, saw nothing, started walking away again.  This time the chirps were more like high pitched beeps, like an electronic signal.  I turned a flashlight to the tree and saw nothing, but the sound went back to being chirps.  The chirps were telling me 'right here, below you' so I looked around the base of the tree and found a small light that is manufactured by a company here in Phoenix. I've read that an electrical company has had communications with ET life but I have not followed up on the lead as of yet. I saw the diamond crafts again last night (04/15/2017) at approximately 21:30, making several passes over my home, but I was unable to follow them this time.  I feel like they can hear my thoughts when they are in close range, like they know I'd like to meet them.  I do not feel as if these being have malicious intent, but they may be part of the collective.  I can feel a sort of pressure in the middle of my forehead when they are around, but I can't be certain if that is a placebo effect or not as I have read about the pineal gland and how many consider it to be the 'third eye'  I plan on investigating further.",

The first object appeared then traveled SE in direction.  Folliwed by a secind that just appeared from nowhere.  At one point they stopped and just stayed there illuminating the sky.  However these objects had no blinking lights like aircraft do. Also just to ket you know there was plenty of planes that were in the area.  Around the Deer Valley Airport to be specific.  Now I know other aircraft spotted these objects and I know for certain the tower had recieved radio contact from many of the planes.  In regards to what was in the sky they were seeing?  Clear as the night sky these objects vanished.  But not because they had gotton further away.  Vanished like looking at them very clear in the sky.  To dimming out and disappearing completely.",

      "story": "Cylindrical silver object approached then receded, then changed shape..began to sparkle then drift away to the west southwest. I was driving west on US-60 on trip to Sky Harbor Airport and noticed a bright silvery cylinder shaped object over, I believe, South Chandler.  I was in the distance... Based on a thin cloud bank I would place the altitude at about 8000' so it must have been large.  I first saw it at the 10 o'clock position.  I first thought that it was sunlight on a jet contrail, but as it became larger I thought that it may be a plane on approach to the Mesa Gateway Airport... then it began to recede to the southwest... I almost wrecked the car trying to watch it.   There have got to be hundreds of witnesses, because it was very prominent... It then drifted back into the thin cloud layer and I thought it was gone, but it was bright enough to shine through...  Then from a cylinder it then appeared as two equally sized globes just touching each other...  I had to watch my driving so looked away briefly and thought it had moved away, but you could still see it behind the thin cloud... at one point it appeared to emit a curving smoke trail... then that stopped and the two globes began to sparkle...  I again resumed driving.... the next time I had a chance to look up it was gone... There absolutely have to be other witnesses to this.  It was still daylight and this thing was prominently in view.  This thing was bizarre.  I checked today's local news.... nothing... but then saw a video on you-tube that showed it... Only at the point where it was two globes. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to 3/20/17 submittal regarding the 3/19/17 incident...  The cylinder was situated at a 30% tilt, higher side to the left.  Object's length was approximately 7 times its width.  US 60 runs exactly east/west... this object was at the 10 o'clock position. It was nearly sunset.  There are always contrails in the very busy skies...they were all orange and this object was silvery white.  The spheres that It turned into were pretty much the same width as the cylinder appearance, but occupied 1/4 the length of the original cylinder.  It is possible that it was two cylinders side by side that turned so as to make it appear as two spheres... just a guess.  The object stayed double-sphere in appearance until it receded to the southwest... emitted a sinuous smoke emission from the left side of the left sphere which dispersed almost immediately... the object was receding slowly... then it began to sparkle with lights brighter than the initial silvery white appear! ance\u2026  I looked away for not more than 10 seconds...when I looked back it was no longer visible.  It is impossible than no one else saw this... as it was fairly large with an apparent width of your index finger at arms length at its narrowest and was slightly larger upon my initial observation.  I am a major sky watcher, and I am certain this had no astronomical explanation. Bizzare\u2026 ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "The Phoenix Lights Incident: Was anyone Abducted like I was On March 13, 1997? Was anyone abducted during the Phoenix Lights Incident?  Because I'm pretty sure I was.   The time was around 7:50 to 8:40 when suddenly my 2 children came running into the Kitchen and said mommy theirs no more stars in the sky!  So I went to see.  And they were right the stars were gone something replaced the stars with what I could describe as perfectly squared knots and bolts connected to rods, like standing underneath a perfectly well made car covered the entire sky.  It was a duel black color and there was no lights and it didn't move it just sat there.  So I started to run down to the corner to see how far this thing went when I stopped short thinking, \"What the hell?\"  when a voice that sounded like myself or my mothers voice say, \"Oh gone its just us, its no big deal go on and see how far this thing goes\"  So I went to see because I felt it was no big deal. And this thing reached from where I was standing at 7th Ave passed Camelback Mountain!!  {Also we lived on a busy street and theirs was no cars, no people, and absolutely no noise. I mean no sound anywhere.  I can't explain it but its as if time stopped.}  Any way, this thing was huge and I yelled to my children who were strangely standing all the way by the door I said, \"Wow!  This thing reaches all the way to camelback mountain wow! And my oldest daughter at the time was 11 years old said, \"Well I'm going in the house\" as if she was frightened and that's not like her to act like that at all.  At that moment that's when I realized I was standing under a Huge Mothership!  So I didn't look up because I didn't want them who were in the Ship to know that I knew it was a Mothership.  So I attempted to make a run for the door when everything suddenly went Black.  I completely Blacked out and cannot remember how the hell I got in the house.  In fact my children and I couldn't remember that entire incident until 13 years later.  So I'd really like to know was an! yone else abducted or did anyone black out like I did?  Because! this incident has been bothering me since I could remembered the incident in 2010.  And I'd really like to know if anyone was abducted, if so what happen to them?

The night was uneventful, and after 30 minutes of not seeing anything out of the ordinary, I was ready to get inside the house, and it happened, high up there, at 80\u00b0 travelling slowly North-NorthEast; it must have been in outer space, I noticed the spaceship because the bottom lights turned on and flickered for 3 to 5 seconds (the lights were like beams forming a V shape with a smaller v in the center, making the lights four beams), and then they went off; since I believe the object was in outer space, it must have been huge in size; I got my binoculars immediately, and looked for the object in the direction it but travelling I wasn't able to locate it anymore... I got so excited and shortly went inside the house to tell ! my wife...

August 4, 2017 approx. 21:15 Phoenix, AZ   It was a clear sky, the moon was out and almost full, the temperature was in the mid to upper 90s. I was swimming in the pool, floating on my back looking at the night sky, when I saw what I thought was a falling star streak from the East-Southeast towards the West-Northwest, stopping short of the Big Dipper.  It struck me as odd right away, as it left behind a glowing trail; something similar to what an old CRT TV would do when you turned it off in a darkened room.   Then, within 3 to 4 seconds, a bright light flashed, just outside of where the streak that was left by the \u201cfalling star\u201d had ended.  That\u2019s when I realized this was not a falling star.   For the next 5 minutes I watched, as this object and possibly two others, flashed intermittently with varying intensity from very bright quick flashes of white, to a dull slowly growing intensity, culminating in bright white, then instantly dark. During this time, the objects started moving to the East very slowly.  There was no pattern or timing to the flashing or the intensity.  The light was mostly white, but there was a bluish tinge to it at times.  It seemed to be 3 objects in close proximity to one another.  After about 5 minutes, the activity was no longer visible.",

      "story": "Daylight object in close proximity to Sky Harbor Airport I was operating a sound system (mics and speakers) for the groundbreaking of a new Valley Metro light rail station at 50th St. and Washington in Phoenix, serving the Ability 360 Center.  This location is almost exactly one mile from the eastern end of the north runway at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, runway 26.  The event was taking place on the roof of the three story facility.  There is a shade structure running along the north and west portions of the roof.  A 20'x20' canopy had been erected to provide shade for the guests.  My position was near the northeast corner of the roof where I had a small audio mixing board set up.  At that time aircraft were departing Sky Harbor to the east, from the north runway, passing less than a half-mile from my position. \tThe event had begun at 8am with the Phoenix Mayor discussing details of the project.  At 8:20am, I noticed an object come into my field of view from the north, just above the Mayor's position at the podium, at a bearing of about 310 degrees.  It was elongated in the horizontal direction, reflective or very light in color.  I could not judge distance, but felt that it might be about a mile away, based on having witnessed countless aircraft approaching Sky Harbor.  I appeared to be similar in size to a small FedEx single engine turboprop aircraft which utilize Sky Harbor.  Its altitude was lower than that of an aircraft crossing over, so I immediately assumed it was making an approach, but it should have been much further west if that were the case.  I could not detect any vertical structure such as a tail, the reflective brilliance made it difficult to make out details. \tIt continued south for a short distance then suddenly either came to a complete stop or made an immediate \u201cjog\u201d toward the west.  At this point the idea of \u201cdrone\u201d popped into my mind, but the apparent distance to the object made it questionable if a drone would be that visible.  The other reason to reject the drone theory was the proximity to Sky Harbor.  The object then continued making a fairly rapid arc toward the southeast, again with an immediate acceleration which seemed very \u201cdrone like.\u201d  I lost sight of it behind the canopy until it emerged southwest of my position.  It appeared to be following the departure path of  runway 25, the center runway, toward the east, but more rapidly than a traditional aircraft. I continued to observe it for another 10 seconds until it moved behind a large structure on the roof.  I moved to the other side of the structure but I did not see the object again. \tI could not detect any noise from the object, at least nothing which I could hear above the traffic on Washington Street and the PA system I was operating.  The movement was unlike normal aircraft in the sudden acceleration and deceleration.  The object's altitude seemed constant. \tBased on the flight path I observed I would dismiss any thought of it being an actual drone.  My immediate reaction was thinking \u201chow bold\u201d to venture into the departure path of Sky Harbor in broad daylight.  I have almost 40 years of working in close proximity to Sky Harbor Airport and am very familiar with aircraft and aircraft operations.  This object did not operate by normal flight standards.",

      "story": "The Phoenix Lights, March 13, 1997 . . . I Saw Something Different. The Phoenix Sighting March 13th, 1997, I Saw Something Different.  This is my story.  It was March in North Phoenix, Arizona.  The Mulberry tree was bare of its leaves, and the weather was chilly.  My residence at the time was at twenty Fourth Avenue just south of Union Hills Road.  This is near the I-17 freeway, and just east of it. It was a cool, clear and quiet night with no clouds.  It was eight fifteen in the evening mountain standard time.  I decided to go outside in my backyard.  I brought my book and book light.  I was sitting in my folding chair in the middle of the lawn facing southwest.   As I was reading, something caught my attention.  To the north, my right peripheral vision alerted me to huge bright lights approaching low and coming right at me!  It was very low.  Immediately, I thought something was going to crash.  Get down!  I dropped my book and lamp.  The chair fell over.  I found  myself lying on my back, my face up, looking directly up at the sight. My view was unobstructed.  It was not a plane.  It was five very large round soft lights, that did not shine down; that glided along silently, in a v formation.  There was absolutely no wings.  There was absolutely no fuselage or body.  I saw clearly the black sky and stars between each large light.  Of this, I am absolutely certain. The five lights were moving together very slow and low.  Each light was distinctly separate and detached from one another.  Silence. The mulberry tree was near the west end of the yard near the wall.  I was in the center of the yard.  The v formation extended directly over top of me; and over the neighbors' yard on the other side west of the property wall.  I could see the entire formation. There were no flashing lights.  There were no colored lights.  All five large round lights were white.  The lights were not shining down.  The lights were soft and white.  It was silent. It was amazing to see such a spectacular sight.  I even waved at the lights.  There were no windows or portals, and there was no body or wings.  The five large lights were gliding together in formation; but they were separate and independent of one another.  The formation was gliding very slow.  I thought that if it moved any slower that it would come to a stop right there in the air.  The silent formation continued on its way south toward downtown Phoenix.  I stood up and watched it until it was out of view. I went inside and recorded in writing my incredible experience in my journal.  That night I thought I was the only one who saw this amazing sight.  I went to bed.  The next morning it was all over the news. The news said there was a report of the Lights called in by a eighteen wheeler truck driver who was heading south on highway I-17.  This was just before the Lights arrived at my location. The news videos showed what happened when the five large round lights in v-formation arrived over downtown Phoenix.  There they were, stationary in the air, at a complete stop.  They presented themselves this way.  Once they had everyone's attention, suddenly they all blinked out. Then after a few moments they blinked on, one at a time until there were twelve lights.  They were in an arch formation with a single light behind and alone a short distance down from the inside of the arch.  It reminded me of a stingray formation with the single light representing the tail. The Phoenix lights remained like this for quite some time.  Clearly, who ever or whatever they were certainly wanted the people to notice them.  It was visibly observed by hundreds of folks downtown.  The twelve lights remained stationary in mid air for quite some time. When the five lights arrived in the skies over downtown Phoenix, they were much higher and appeared much smaller, like tennis ball size.  There was filmed news coverage and many civilian reports.  Small aircraft were flying under them.  Large jets were landing and taking off at the Phoenix International Airport.  News and police helicopters flew around.  Luke Air force base sent out jets to investigate.  Air Traffic control was inundated with calls.  People were out and about downtown and saw it all.  Calls were flooded in to the police and sheriff\u2019s departments.  Nobody had any answers. The stingray formation remained stationary in place above the Phoenix sky downtown for quite a while.  When they were ready, all the twelve circular lights suddenly blinked out together.  Then they reappeared again as five large circular lights in a chevron formation. This was exactly the way the lights were as I originally witnessed them at very close range. Silently, they moved together in the Chevron formation to the west and flew slowly and silently turning north again near the 101 freeway; and continuing north and out of sight. After this, for days and weeks talk and speculations abounded.  There was a town meeting called to discuss what the people saw.  Jim Dilettoso of Village Labs in Tempe, Arizona, digitally examined the video and film data.  It was scientifically determined the lights were not flares.  All lighting was compared with the different types of lighting in Phoenix.There were no matches.  It was determined there were no known lights of this kind, and considered it an unknown. I want to say that what I saw was different and closer than what many others saw. I saw it up close. It was close enough that it was a stone\u2019s throw away. I am a credible witness, educated and I hold a doctorate. I have not heard any witness reports of this sighting as close as I witnessed it. For example, Scottsdale is quite a ways east of Phoenix and the I-17.  There was a woman in north Scottsdale that saw the formation but it was very tiny at that distance that was nearly microscopic.  She took pictures.  All that was in the picture were very tiny dots of light.  This witness and others who were not anywhere close to the sighting claimed there was a fuselage and wings between the lights.  Some said there were windows and beings looking out the windows.  I beg to disagree.  I can assure you this is nonsense. I saw what I saw and I don\u2019t deny it.  This is my story.  This is the absolute truth. Respectfully submitted. PS.  I have remained silent until now because at the time I was in practice and was employed by a corporation.  If I spoke of such things, I would have risked my job.  So I kept silent until now.  Today, I am retired, and I am relieved to at last tell the truth of my Phoenix Lights experience.",

About 11:00pm, in the city of Phoenix, Az, about 5 miles South of Sky Harbor airport, as I sat in my backyard I observed a black chevron-shaped UFO pass over me as it traveled in a South-Easterly direction at a quite high rate of speed.  The object was in my field of vision for at least three seconds but no more than five as it passed overhead in total silence.  I had no reference to be able to judge its size or altitude accurately, but if I had to estimate its altitude I would suggest that it would be in the 500-750ft range.

The object was black, darker than the night sky as we have a lot of light pollution.  The underside of the craft had circular lights on the bottom.

I don't know if it was angels or what, but it was real.  My mom went out for the night and I was home with only my uncle who slept in the other room.  At some point during the night I woke up and was encompased by a tube of swirling light with little flashing sparkling particles moving around me.  I was being carried up through the roof and I was trying to reach for the blowing curtains or anything I could grab to keep me from going.  When I reached the ceiling I blacked out 'till the next morning.  When I woke up I could tell that something was still there, and I was afraid to open my eyes.  When it walked I could hear static foot steps as they walked.  Then there was nothing.  I finally had enough courage to open my eyes and I saw my mom so I looked around and was amazed.  I have never made my bed. My bed was not made when I went to sleep.  When I looked down, my bed was PERFECTLY made around me.  I asked my mom and uncle if they made my bed around me to cover me up, they said they had not. That is how I know I wasn't dreaming.  That day after, people at our pool and I saw a UFO being chased by 4 black military helecopters.  That is the only recollection I have, but my mom said we were both picked up together another time, and the day after I told her, \"They showed me music.\"  The only thing I can figure is whatever writing they showed me looked like musical notes, because that is what I was learning in school around that time.  This is all true, I would be interested in going under hypnosis to recall more of what had happened.   I am a born again Christian and don't necessarily believe in aliens per say, but I know what happened to me was real, I would like to understand. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

What was remarkable about them was that they were doing what was some kind of coordinated dance; two and three orbs would merge together into one orb, and then would separate again, and spin around each other gracefully.  In some cases three orbs would form a triangle with three points, and then merge into one orb again, and then move back into a triangle formation.  Other times two orbs would merge, separate, dance around each other, and then merge again. I have seen a number of UFOs in my life, but this was most remarkable, and clearly not of this world.  Interestingly, my mother was not able to see them other than saying, \"All I see are some glints of metal in the sky.\"  She could not see the orbs merging together, separating, and dancing around each other, although her eye sight is fine. I attempted to film this display, but had a nearly impossible time getting my camera phone to focus on the objects, it seemed like they didn't want to be filmed!  So was not able to capture much.",

They appeared to be bright orange-red glowing objects, fireballs.  They didn't appear to be bright red in the videos I will be submitting, but they were with the naked eye, bright red-orange fireball looking objects usually following the same trajectory each night.  Sometimes just one visible, at other times, several at one time at an unknown distance apart in the sky.  I live in Arcadia, a suburb in east phoenix, with a view of southern sky.

I was relaxing in the back of my van on a beautiful rainy evening in Phoenix Arizona.  The day had already been quite weird, such as electronics not working correctly, lots of forgetfulness etc.  Anyhow, I was sitting in the pitch dark enjoying the rainfall when I was moved to turn on my video camera on my phone. I have no idea why I decided to go ahead and just start recording in the dark, but I did.  After about a minute I decided that this was stupid and it was time to go inside my friends home to sleep.  I laid on the couch and decided to watch the video.  What I captured was unbelievable. I recorded a landing of extraterrestrial nature, mind you I did not see this happening while I was recording.  It only showed up in the video. I was stunned at what my camera picked up and began to zoom in and take screenshots of the activity. The more screenshots I took the more in dept! h I saw what had happened. I saw myself walk into the craft as well as these light beings who were performing acts I did not understand. I became obsessed and couldn\u2019t stop going deeper. The next day I became very ill and could barely function. I stayed sick for about a week before I started feeling normal again. A couple weeks down the road I felt strange and I had skipped my period. I had not been intimate with anyone for months but felt the need to get a pregnancy test. So I did and it was positive. I started to freak out because there was no way possible and I had no one to confide in. A few days later I ended up having a miscarriage and was devastated as well as relieved. Since this experience my life has never been the same. I want to share my footage and my story with others because I know I am not the only one who has experienced this.",

Straight line, there were 10-12 points of light, they looked like bright stars, but were travelling in unison, at the same speed. The middle one (#7) broke out of formation, dipped down, and re-joined the group. The line travelled in right-to-left, and formed a streak in the sky, as if a meteor was breaking apart. Again, all the points were the same speed, in unison. The north-south trajectory slanted into the sky, and dissappeared over the next 10 seconds into the atmosphere.",

This morning I watched 2 of them go across the sky right above me.  Soon after that I saw more and more and more coming one after the other.  They were coming from the North West and traveling South East.  They were exactly the same distance from one another following each other in a line formation.  They kept coming for over 12 minutes and I counted over 50.  They were as bright as planet and a bit smaller.  I stood up and watched this in amazement.  It was literally a fleet of UFO star like orbs.  Someone else HAD to have seen this.",

They appeared to be traveling about the same speed as the space station (when I have seen it) and altitude perhaps about 40,000 feet.  This follows a similar sighting the morning prior to Thanksgiving 2019 also around 6:15am where about the same number of \"craft\" were seen traveling from west to east, about the same speed and altitude, but spaced more closely and not as even.  Sky was clear both mornings.  Brightness was about the same as average stars.  The light was constant, no flickering, etc. no sound.  Aircraft were in the area, but routine and not appearing to interact.",

They were evenly spaced apart, white and NOT flashing or blinking.  As I watched them move across the sky they went from one horizon in the NW to the SW in a span on less than 2 minutes.  Extremely high altitude as there was commercial air traffic with standard blinking lights at lower elevations in the sky typical to the metro area.  When I witnesses the first light I thought is was possible to be a satellite until they began to appear in a string like fashion.  String of the 7 lights were approximately 1/3 filed of view of entire skyline and were visible in total when almost directly above the north central metro area.",

It was a light ,I thought it may have been the ISS. I have witnessed this before , Usually I would watch the light pass over until it vanished in the SSE sky , then go inside to the computer to check my sighting . This morning however the lights kept on coming . They were spaced apart and formed a line . I thought maybe satellites or possible commercial flight path but they kept on coming . I then thought military but they kept on coming . There were two instances when there were two lights moving parallel with each other . they all were moving in a perfect line perfectly spaced . I counted at least 30 .",
