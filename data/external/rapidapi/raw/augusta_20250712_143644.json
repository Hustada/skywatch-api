The boys tumbled into the house from playing, white as sheets, and the two younger prodded the oldest to talk to me the \"big sister\" babysitting for the evening.  I listened impatiently as the oldest stuttered out that there was something HUGE up in the sky blocking the stars and it was a triangle and it wasn't high up but it wasn't low either and there were stars all around it and it WASN'T MAKING ANY NOISE and ended with, \"we're scaaared!\".  (I'm not sure if I remember he noticed lights or not). I laughed and said I would check it out and they pleaded with me not to, but I told them mom and dad wouldn't believe us unless I saw it, too.   I looked outside and up and it was exactly as he said.  A big black triangular void with no noise and no movement and no emissions, yet stars all around it.  I also noticed a complete absence of bugs, birds or pets making any noise and that's when I really creeped out and fear overcame my curiosity and I backed into the house slowly, keeping my eye on the unknown object.  It seemed like it was no more than a couple of hundred feet up which would mean I should be able to hear something!   My parents thought we made it all up of course and suggested it might be a weather balloon or experimental aircraft from Bush Field Airport or Fort Gordon Military Base.  I never believed that.   When I saw the stealth bomber years later it reminded me of it, although this had what appeared to be equal angles (equilateral) but again, there was no noise, no movement, and no emissions.  Just a big black triangular void that was definitely a solid object silently hanging in the air.  I don't remember seeing lights, but my brothers might, I'm going to ask them when I get a chance.

As we looked around at other parts of the sky we noticed about 5 more. They all were hovering and a gigantic circle with their lights bliking...Red, Blue Green Yellow! In that order.

I was between Washington Rd and Bobby Jones exits when I saw a dark shape in the sky flying at about 2 o'clock to the right of my car.  It zig-zagged and started coming toward the highway. I thought...wow! That is a huge bird!...and by the time that it got over the highway, I thought that it might be a helicopter, but it had no tail and no propellers.  It had no lights and was completely silent. It got close enough for me to tell that it was black and looked like a rectangular pod of some sort and definitely mechanical-looking. I could see side pipes and what might look like vents on it.  Although it was difficult to tell just how high it was, it was not too high...as I looked to the left over my shoulder as I saw it go across me over the highway, it looked like it just skirted the tree line before it disappeared.  I was not scared, but had a car behind me and I did have to be careful, because I did not want to run my car off the road.  If it was a plane or a helicopter, it would have had lights.

The area where I was staying is dotted with ICBM sites that are in eyesight of the road leading to the cabin.   The closest site to the cabin I believe was roughly 20 miles as the crow flies from the cabin.  I also believe that numerous other ICBM sites exist in the area that are sub Terra.   Six of us were sitting around a campfire, when a large reddish greenish glow started to crest the hill which leads down to the property.  We were staring uphill from a lower location looking up the road as the light crested the hill.  When a vehicle drives at night, which is rare anyways out there, the light does not crest the hills, the dips between the roads blocks out all night until the vehicle crests the top.  The light we saw was roughly 80-100 yards away.   Our first thought was that we were not witnessing a vehicle at all, but aurora borealis.  I remember a friend saying its aurora, but i fiercely d! oubted this accusation as the object grew brighter and showered the beam across the 4 acre property.  The object on the hill became glowing with a greenish purplish hue, that flooded the entire area we were staying in.  It illuminated all the trees behind us upwards to over one hundred yards.  The light seemed to expand over the entire area, then began to pulsate with tremendous colored light.   Six of us distinctly remember the intensity of the light and its changing color structure.  I remember staring directly at the object, then having the desire to walk towards it.  Not in an abduction sense, but more so a mix of curiosity and some sort of draw towards it.   My friend and I began to run towards it with his German Shepard.  As we started running to the top of the hill the orb pulsated and vanished.  No contrails, nothing at all, just turned itself off and vanished.  Since I was running up to the craft, my friend that was stationary said that the object had a center where ! the light was radiating out from.   What happened after the UFO left was also very interesting.  Every single one of us said we could feel some sort of energy within our bodies.  It was a very intense feeling, and it was not nerves or adrenaline.  It was as if my body was charged up or another state of awareness.  Everyone I was with said they could feel this feeling as well, upwards to an hour.   Within twenty minutes of the sighting, we noticed two planes flying overhead at low altitude with no lights at all.   Just two planes within a minute of each other, jet black, and not a single emitting light.  One of my friends who was in his tent at the time of the siting, said he felt an intense light pulse through the tent and that he could feel the presence of something hes never felt before.  The dog in his tent, had erratic behavior after and during the light.   The following day on the road out, we witnessed more U.S. Government plates on SUV vehicles than I have ever seen in a population of 287 people.  At first I was not going to post my encounter, but after reading countless reports of minutemen and other military personnel that were stationed in the exact same area, and reporting exactly and very close to what I saw, I changed my mind.   I believe ICBM sites are the main focus of these lights people have been seeing since the Cold War.  The incident at Maelstrom AFB really made me interested, and an avid believer that nuclear power and ICBM are of great interest to whatever is out there.",

About 15 minutes south of Augusta, Maine, we saw a huge blossoming, neon blue explosion, north, directly in front of us just over the horizon.  Three seconds later we saw another, a little farther to the east, toward the ocean. The color was similar to the blue flames on a propane stove.  If you held your hand out straight in front of your face and spread your fingers, they were about that size. My wife and I have seen bolides (exploding meteors) before, and these were nothing like that.  The flash came from the ground up, brighter blue at the bottom, with no streak or trail in the sky to indicate anything fell.   The rest of our trip home we did not see anything else unusual Just wanted to put this out to see if anyone else reports it.",

Another light (a smaller white one) detached from the object, it stayed stationary and the other object we first saw faded away like it was burning out but still travelling in the same direction. No noise could be heard from the sky, it appeared to be in the atmosphere, definitely did not appear to be a plane or satellite.  When I squinted and blocked out the street lights I almost want to say it was a V shaped craft with a rocket thruster propelling it into the atmosphere to deploy a smaller object.

I was looking out the patio doors when I saw what I thought was a meteor streak by and disappear over the horizon.  The only difference being when it reached the horizon it winked out of sight instantly. 2 minutes later I decided to walk out onto out deck and I noticed a bright light heading toward my position.  As I watched it approach I began filming it with my cell phone.  It was far below the orbits of any satellite, and as it grew closer the light grew brighter in intensit. We are less than a mile from the Augusta airport and there were planes doing instrument takeoffs at the time. There were no strobes or usual aircraft lights on this object. There was no sound as it passed over head and headed Northeast. I am familiar with every form of conventional aircraft having grown up an air show kid and I keep up to date on military and civilian craft that operate I this area.  The crazy thing about this is the next day two of my students who were in Winslow Maine! , which is 15 miles north northeast of Augusta told me they were outside at about 10:00 and an object passed overhead, spun around and took off.I know these kids and they wouldn't make this up. They couldn't believe what they were seeing. I also have two videos of the object. In one video you can clearly see the object as it passes. An early video I took as it first appeared shows the object winking in and out as it slowly moves across the sky. The strange thing Is as I recorded that I watched the object as it crossed the sky and I never lost sight of it. It did not wink in and out of sight. I don't know if it is because the quality of the camera or if it was due to some type of electrical interference.",

It reminded me of how a bulb still glows slightly for a split second once it has been shut off.  After about 5 seconds, the remaining two lights went out at the exact same time (and in the same \"slow\" manner). The lights were not seen again. bright flash in bellingham area.

We began too see a orangish white glow in the sky about the size  of a star . We saw it travailing across the sky for a minute and a half till it was out of site over the roof of the house.  I looked at her   and said that was probably  a satelite going by . I got busy doing something else  for  about 7 minutes   I looked up  aigan    I could see another star like object moving very very quickly 2 times faster than the other object I had seen  this got my attention!!

I was at Klondike Park, a sandstone-rich park in Augusta, Missouri, which is in eastern Missouri about fifty miles west of St. Louis.  The brilliant white sandstone is why it\u2019s called Klondike Park because it sort of looks like the rocks are snow-covered. I was on a night hike. I was looking up at the stars, and it was a beautiful night for doing so, completely clear and far enough from civilization to where you could see a lot of them.  I believe I was looking up into the low eastern sky but I cannot guarantee that (I was looking up and to the right; if I had looked up and to the left I would have been looking at the Big Dipper and Orion). I happened to be looking at two ordinary stars, not very bright, right next to each other.  Since they were so ordinary, why I found myself fixated on them for more than a few seconds is a mystery. Anyway, it turns out that one of the stars was not so ordinary. Suddenly one of them starts moving straight away from the other, a very smooth movement. I thought, \"Oh it\u2019s a plane,\" even though a few seconds before it had been completely stationary. Then, suddenly, it vanished! It was just gone. Now since it had been stationary I don\u2019t see how it could have been a plane or a meteor or even a satellite. Barring any weird astronomical phenomena I am unfamiliar with, I would have to say that was some sort of flying object, and since I could not identify it, I guess that was a UFO. But was it an alien spacecraft of some sort? Who knows? I don\u2019t. But I definitely could not identify it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))",

No other stars, the moon, or objects in the sky were visible at this time.    It was seen for 20 minutes.  At first it was a single white light that was unmoving.  I thought it was an airplane but the light was in the same place for 10 minutes.   In the past plane lights would move into the landing pattern at either Bush Field or Daniel Field.   At that time a smaller red light was observed slightly south of the bright white light. The red light faded and blinked out then came on again. Just after that the larger white light faded and blinked out for 2 seconds and came on again.  The red light and white light repeated this two more times.  Then the red light blinked out and did not come back on.  The larger white light moved sharply up, down, left and right as if it were hopping or dancing.  Then stopped in prior position and was steady for another 2 minutes.   It faded off, came back on brighter than before, blinked out and then on two more times then faded out and was gone.  The observer has experience watching airplane traffic for 48 years.

It was hovering just over to the side of the road, not moving, not making any sound.   I slowed down and watched it, it seemed to be tilting as I watched.

      "story": "What was this? I've never seen anything like it in person. I took my daughter to the mall shopping for her birthday coming up.  As we were leaving, my daughter pointed out a light in the sky and said, \"Hey mom, what is that?\"  Let it be known, I have never seen a UFO, though I have studied the phenomenon in depth.  My children are teens and are aware of this too.  We are always skywatching when we are out and about but don't take time out of our day to do this.   I'm always looking up due to what I know has been occurring around the world in increased frequency.   Anyway, it was far enough away to not be able to make out a true shape but very large.  It was not a star, it was not an airplane, it was not a tower, airport, anything like that.   I'm a huge skeptic so I went through all of the possibilities internally...nothing fit.  There was a smaller light that seem to be fading in and out and zooming into the craft and away again.  We decided to follow it.  It was only hovering at first but then it began to move slowly away. I finally found a dark road and have two pieces of footage.  The craft was further away from us at this point and began to change colors from green, red, blue.  The little light (possible craft) was still going away from it and going back in to it but at this point it was so far away it could have been a star.   At the mall, it was pretty clear and large.  Well clear enough to know it wasn't a star, satellite, or anything remotely close to what I've ever seen in the sky on earth.   It was hovering again on the second footage.   I would like to have this footage analyzed.  How can I get someone to do this?  I want to know what this was?",

Little did I know, that this would be a night I will always remember.  As I got done closing, I walked to my red Mustang and proceeded to drive home.  I had a thirty-minute drive ahead of me because I lived in a small town outside of Wichita.   Between Wichita and Augusta there is a long stretch of nothing but fields and small businesses.  Once you leave Andover, it is nothing but darkness on the roads.  Outside of Augusta about five minutes, there is an airport.  Anyways, as I was driving, I was talking to my friend on the phone.  The Kansas sky was dark like every other day.  It was as clear as could be that night and there was not a cloud in the sky.   As I was getting close to the airport, I seen this big, white light in the sky.  I did not think much because I knew planes were flying at this time.  But as I was looking closer at it, I realized that this object or orbs that I had see! n was not a plane at all.  A big light slowly appeared.  Then another one would appear in front of it.  Then, the orb in the back would slowly diminish and appear in the front of the other one.  It did this about three times as it went across the sky and then it completely went away.  I knew it wasn\u2019t a plane because planes are required to have red and green lights on them.  This had no lights period.  It was just a big light. It is hard to describe.   Anyways, about a minute later, the light appeared back in the same exact spot it went off.  Now, planes don\u2019t disappear in mid air and then appear in the same exact spot.  The light did the same thing. There was a big light, then another one appear in front of that one.  The light behind would slowly disappear and then appear in front of the other.  I tried to capture it on video but I couldn\u2019t because I was driving.   After about two times of appearing and disappearing, the lights disappeared for good.  It just vanished in thin air.  It didn\u2019t speed away, just went off where I last seen it.  I was waiting for it to come back on because it did that before but it did not appear again.  Still till this day, people think I am crazy, but I know what I saw that night and it is something that I cannot describe.  I seen it with my own two eyes and I know for a fact that what I seen was not an aircraft at all.   I wish someone could give me some answers or explanations of what this could be.  Until I get some answers, I am fully convinced that what I seen was a U.F.O. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

On Thursday, September 13, 2018, my friend and I were sitting out front of  my apartment building, probably around 1 a.m. or so and I noticed what at first glance looked like a star maybe burning out.  It had reds, greens, and blue tints to it and was flashing pretty steadily. I then realized what ever this is was definitely hovering somehow.  You could see it slowly moving from left to right.   When that caught our attention we finally decided to take a look at the sky and there were MULTIPLE objects in the sky that fit the same description.  Just looking at them you could see the flashing and hovering.  Some would just appear.  We have these little toy binoculars, that still work pretty good, that we started looking at the objects better and through that they looked as if things were coming out of them sort of like flares, they seemed long, like a trail of something entering into the atmosphere.  We noticed some made up a circle formation and then some were making u! p a triangle formation.  Then there would be groups of maybe six objects swarming around each other.  They were smaller and farther off so the way I can really explain it is when you see the gnats flying around a street light,  This was going on for a few hours.  I happened to walk outside about 6 a.m when the sun was barely out and there was one left in the sky and it was so bright as if the sun was bouncing of a metallic surface.  I was able to get a video of that one, I couldn\u2019t figure out the shape but you could easily tell it wasn\u2019t a plane or a satellite.  It almost looked like it was breaking off into smaller pieces and coming back to its original form but it was gone by the time the sun came all the way up.",
