      "story": "Crescent shaped objects over missle test range. I was looking towards McGregor range, a missle range north of El Paso.    There I saw what I thought was a large plane flying rather high over that airspace.  It was extremely bright in the pre-twilight evening. This is a flight area for planes landing at the internation airport in El Paso so I really did not think much about it.  I saw another jet fly below it.  The second jet was definitely coming towards the airport and even though it was approaching twilight, I could not see the landing lights. It was still too light outside.   I could see the form of the plane as a shadow. The second jet left a vapor trail.  This caused me to ponder and wonder how the plane flying higher did not leave any trail. I watched the  first craft and its glistening shape changed slightly to crescent as if it had turned to reveal its profile.  It seemed to have pivoted at the spot it was at.  It made no motion in relation to objects on the ground.  From my observation point - several miles from McGregor range - and having seen a commerial aircraft look like fly specks below this craft, I suddenly was aware I was looking at something extraordinary.  This thing seemed to be about 1/4 inch wide now from my front yard - but if it were higher than commerical airliners and further away, it had to simply be huge. A speck of light sudden flew up from the ground east of the crescent and appeared slammed into the crescent at an extremely high rate of speed. I've been involve in missles and I've never seen one as fast as this one.  The crescent seemed to absorb the speck.  I thought at first that it might have been a missle from McGreor, but having just seen a commerical plane in that airspace, that did not make any sense. McGreor would have closed off its airspace before any test firings.  Commerical traffic was still using this airspace.  There did not appear to be any materials falling away from the crescent shaped object as one might expect if it were hit with a missle. From my point of view, it appeared another speck of light came from just below the crescent and also slammed into the crescent. It was not as fast as the first, but still far beyond convential craft speeds.  I realized there was no vapor trail from the smaller speck. About that time, on the horizon appeared three vapor trails in formation that were rapidly approaching the area. I suspect they were from the near by airforce base, but that is nearly 100 miles from here.  They might have been from White Sands - a little closer. The cresent turned from sunlight white to a brighter blue white light and in just a few milli-seconds was too small to see. I assume it was traveling away at an extraordinarily high speed. The three vapor trails that were approaching the area sharply did a 180 degree turn.",

      "story": "\"dog fight' between stars At about 10:10 P.M. On 5/4/06,  I was in my backyard sitting down,  when I saw (flash) lighting. The whole sky lit up on the horizon, north to west. Nothing out of the ordinary, but there was'nt a cloud in the sky. Told my wife about the event and couldn't figure it out.   Went online to check local weather and current lighting strikes.  Nearest strike was in Abliene, TX.   Not a cloud in the sky. This got me curious, so I was looking in the sky for clouds or a storm.  Looking to the northwest low to the horizon (now about 5- 10 mins later), I saw 4-5 faint star looking objects floating around doing unbelievable manuvers. These objects would be moving slow at first, then at lighting speed change direction.  Sometimes you see only 1 at a time.  Sometimes two or three at a time.   The best I can describe it was it looked like a \"dog-fight\" between stars. They would move up and down, left to right,  figure eights, you name it, zig-zag, at all different speeds. Their speed was unbelievable.  This was not man-made!   Notified my wife and woke up my 8 yr. old son to witness.  My son got very scared and started crying, my wife couldn't comment.  Called a buddy who lives west of me about 7mi. Told him where to look, he didn't see anything, but his wife did.  Haven't spoke to her yet on what exactly see saw.  The whole event lasted approx. 15-20 mins.  All their manuvers stayed in the general location.  Notified local UFO hot-line and made a report.  I do not know who to turn to or what?   Just wondering if anybody else has witnessed this in the El Paso or Las Cruces, NM, area.  Thanks!",

      "story": "Military jet takes off and tries to intercept a disc-shaped UAP. As jet gets close, both UAP and jet suddenly disappear. My friends and I were returning home, traveling north on Rte 54 (Patriot Freeway).  At about 3:01 pm I noticed a fighter jet taking off from Biggs Airfield at Fort Bliss, El Paso, TX.  As I watched it ascend, it began to turn East away from me as it climbed rapidly.  I thought its flight path unusual, and continued to watch it ascend towards a bank of clouds above it.  The jet turned so sharply that its wings were vertical to the ground as it made a U-turn back towards the South.  Then I noticed an object hovering just below the clouds over Biggs Army Airfield.  I recognized it as a UAP or UFO, and grabbed my cell phone camera.  It took me a few seconds to get the camera operating.  By that time the jet was rapidly closing the gap with the UAP.  In response, the UAP began to back up and move away from the approaching jet.  I was stunned!  I aimed my camera and pushed the shutter button, but my cell phone camera did not respond fast enough.  Suddenly both the UAP and jet both disappeared.  The photograph time is 3:03 pm, taken just after the jet and UAP disappeared.  I asked my friend, who was driving, and he said he didn't see it.  He is an audio witness to my sighting.  I have no idea what happened to that jet. The picture shows the scene with the distant Hueco Tanks Mountains and sacred Cero Alto Mountain (tallest) in the background to the East.  The picture recorded the date and time of the photograph, and even GPS location of our car at 3,000 Gateway North Boulevard (access road to the Patriot Freeway).  Visibility was excellent at 10 miles.  I overlaid the photo with an image of what type of UAP/UFO I saw and the type of jet, as best as I could make out from four miles away (map distance).  I added dots to mark the path of the jet as it made a high-angle U-turn towards the UAP/UFO. I posted this picture and account on my Facebook profile, and had a number of responses.  Ted Roe of NARCAP made an interesting comment:  T. R. (NARCAP)  My guess.... plane was too close when the ufo bolted, inside the envelope when it jumped.  Probably carried the plane with it to where ever it was when it stopped... F18.... I watched one pursuing an object that appeared to be 2 silver spheres connected with a thin bar.... it left instantaneously but the plane wasn't that close.",

      "story": "Triangular craft spotted.  I have reported this case to the MUFON and received no response despite hours of phone interviews. Months later I had to contact the investigator only to be told that what I saw was indeed unidentified.  I have amazing video of what I saw, strange occurrences in the sky within the following day, and strange occurrences that have happened to me after.  On the night of April 20, 2019, I was driving down my neighborhood street to the corner gas station. It was a clear, dark desert night. There are no tall trees or obstructions in this area.  When I was driving, I saw an odd light pattern in the sky that caught my interest, but as I was driving I was unable to stop.  I spent roughly fifteen minutes at the corner store before proceeding back home on the same path I had come.  At this time, 9:20 PM, I saw the light pattern again and I was able to safely stop and record. I have a twenty-second video, but I watched for around 10-15 minutes before I could no longer see. What I saw was triangular, with three white lights. The craft was low, too low to be considered normal. Too slow to be considered normal. Too quiet to be considered normal. It would stop for seconds, it would disappear for seconds. It just seemed as it was lazily passing over the neighborhood. It should be noted that there is an airport in my city as well as an Army base, but both are considerably far from where the incident occurred.  Very odd things followed for months that I do not wish to publish here but will discuss with a NUFORC member. I truly believe I have caught a UFO in film and the events surrounding will only support the story. I am a scientific person to my core and I have grown up on military bases, so I would not jump to far-fetched conclusions unless I really believed.",

I was in the army stationed at Fort Bliss Texas (the air defense center) training to shoot down aircraft.  Fort Bliss is not too far from Biggs Air Force Base. ( A SAC Bomber Base).  We had fallen out for formation around 4:30 in the morning and it was about 1 hour before sunrise.  While standing in formation (I) we observed a dish shaped object approaching from the west, white in color,( that could have been due to the altitude and the reflection of the rising sun giving it that color) and you could tell it was spinning because what appeared to be flames were coming off of it. The object stopped very suddenly and began to hover.  You could tell that the object was spinning and leaving what you could say was a vapor trail.  The object moved at great speed and would stop abruptly and change direction. The entire platoon witnessed this object for about 10 minutes.  As with any occurance like this; we talked about it during breakfast and I think that is as far as it went. We had heard on the news several reports of strange  objects being seen in other areas of the Texas panhandle around the same period of time.   Finally the object reversed itself and went out of site in the direction from where it came.  But when the sun came up the vapor trail disappeared. There were no flashing lights or lights that could be seen nor was there any sound that could be heard. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I set it up as fast as I could, the object had moved much further than I had initially anticipated it moving, but I did get it in the sights of the camera for awhile, until I couldn\u2019t hold the focus on it anymore.  The craft was orange and looked to be a concaved sphere shape, on one end, and pointy on the other, and was rotating around, and shape-shifting, it was heading to the North-West and there was for a brief moment, another object much smaller, flew right up to it, and away again, the smaller craft was traveling to the North-East, I cant imagine the altitude, but it was WAY up there by this time.  The smaller craft that comes right up to the larger craft and moves away without slowing, I never would have seen the smaller craft without the aid of the video camera, if I hadn\u2019t been following the larger craft, I would never have seen the smaller one.  I did later record a passing airplane, to show perspective.  I have the video recorded to VHS if you want it. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t The triangular/star end was shifting to a circle shape, that then ballooned out to a mirror of the concaved side, then back to a circle then to the star again, and back and forth, while always spinning around.

While locking our westward facing sliding door I noticed a stationary and flashing light that seemed to be bigger and brighter than the surrounding stars.  The size and brightness appeared to be at least twice the size of stars near the position of the light. It appeared similar to a street light from two miles away.  The somewhat large size and the quickly changing colors are what cought my eye.  The light appeared motionless long enough to be video taped for several minutes.  The sky was partly cloudy with a half moon near the eastern horizon.  With the video camera zoomed in on the light it appeared diffused with a very bright center region with multiple flashes of red, green, purple, and white lights around the edge.  When I first saw the light I assumed that it was Venus but it appeared brighter and bigger with multiple flashing colors.  I will attempt to download the digital video in the near future.  The light was positioned west by north west from my position at approximately 25 degrees from the western horizon.  At approximately 12:20am on 8/17/06 I stopped recording and went in the house to go to bed with the light still in the same position.  I have assumed that the light was Venus but crop circles have been reported 60 miles west by north west of my position and thought that I should at least report my experience.  Total vewing time would be about 20 minutes.  At one point a commercial flight passed within the \"vicintiy\" of the light without making any noticable flight path changes.  Venus?  Or Intergalatic Crop Dusters????",

My sister her boyfriend and I exited a museum in the downtown are proceeding to our vehicle south. I was looking at the moon cresent and noticed two whitelights or bright reflections equidistant from each other at the same height. At first I thought they were balloons. I quickly realized they werent when these two round shapes started to move southwest at a slow speed. After about seven minutes of floating in that direction, we noticed a flicker of reflection,1 as if it rolled from the top end of a cigar shaped craft at one end( round white shape), and made its way round and round until it dicsipated at the other end(round white shape). After it hit the other end, there was what seemed like a long bent foil piece falling down as the two white shapes continued to move southwest still equidistant at the same speed. I observed the falling object and compare it to bent foil. It almost as if someone had bent a piece of rectangular foil several times in equal sections, then slightly unbent it. This is the most accurate description  I can give if someone trys to imagine a falling slightly unbent piece of foil and the reflctions from the sun it gives off as it falls end over end. The object stopped halfway down from the other craft? and what I thought were the suns reflections turned to a slow pulsing glow. About one every 2-3 seconds.It is at this time that the object starte to move horizontally but slighty up and down as it proceeded to move out of view behind some building towards the Northeast end of the city. I got the chills when this happened yesterday. I also called the local news station, but they transferred me to someones voicemail. I couldnt focus my cellphone camera far enough to capture it. I had no camcorder or other camera with me. I also checked to see if it might had been the shuttle detaching from the ISS, but nope that was delayed. I hope that there were other witness because passerrs by seemed oblivious to the event.2",

There were about five ARMY HELICOPTERS surrounding it and the object was VERY LOW about the same level as the helicopters.

It was a beautiful clear day, no clouds and around 78 Fahrenheit. Description: One large white object, oval and moving very slowly towards the mountains.  Around the large oval object were about 19 smaller, objects looming around the larger object.  There was a very big difference in size between the larger object and the other smaller ones. The large one was very easy to see.  The smaller ones were very small and spread out.  With much difficulty we were able to count 19 of the smaller ones. Their shape:  The large one had the shape of a jellyfish oval on top and flatter on the bottom with shaded area on bottom.  The small objects were bright white specks such as a star might look in the daytime.  However, these were not stars.  They were spread out around the white object and stayed around it for 5-10 minutes.  After that, we were only able to see the bigger object and no longer saw the bright specks anywhere. There was air traffic in the area, bith civil and air force. Our background:  First observer = wife; educator in school district.  Second observer=husband; real estate.

      "story": "Delta-shaped metallic object observed for about a minute, and then disappeared. Report on UFO Sighting 18 July, 2007, 12:45 P.M. M.D.T. El Paso, Texas  \tAt approximately 12:45 P.M. local time on July 18, 2007, I was riding my motorcycle north on Hueco Tanks Road in far-east El Paso County, Texas. Visibility was unlimited to the north, ahead of me. The sky was perfectly clear with no clouds visible in that area at all. About forty degrees above the horizon and slightly to my west I saw a flat, disk-shaped object. It appeared to be immobile, and that is what attracted my attention. It was precisely on the glide-path to El Paso International Airport, and at first glance, I assumed it was a traditional aircraft. But after watching it for perhaps five seconds, I decided that that was not the case: it did not appear to be moving, though I cannot swear to that, since I myself was traveling at sixty miles per hour. Its shape\u2014a disk, flat top and bottom and squared off at each end, like three quarters stacked atop one another\u2014precluded the possibility that it was any aircraft with which I am familiar. \tI observed this craft for perhaps thirty seconds from this perspective: edge-on. Then a startling thing happened: the craft banked to the left about eighty degrees and presented me with a virtually perfect view of its top surface (or perhaps its bottom surface). Still it did not appear to be moving horizontally. My vision is perfect, conditions were perfect, and I was able to get a crystal-clear sighting of this object. It was delta shaped, coming to a point at one end and flat at the other. It was not an equilateral triangle: the two sides leading to the point were somewhat longer than was the third side, by perhaps twenty-five percent or a third. In simple terms, it looked like an arrowhead. It was metallic, resembling what I can best describe as brushed stainless steel or aluminum. In other words, it was reflective and shiny, but not brilliantly so. There were no indentations or irregularities whatsoever on its perimeter. I saw no ports or evidence of openings of any kind. There was nothing to suggest any leading aerodynamic edges to indicate wings. It was a very simple, delta-shaped object with three flat sides forming its perimeter. \tSafety dictated that I glance down at the road to make sure I was still in my lane. This consumed only a fraction of a second. When I looked back toward the object, it was gone\u2014just gone. Whether it disappeared or flew away at high speed I cannot say. I heard nothing. One fraction of a second it was there, and the next fraction of a second it was not there. If it did in fact fly away, it must have traveled at immense speed, because I could see for many miles in all directions. I scanned the sky thoroughly for quite some time, until I was convinced it was truly not there. There are some mountains in this area, but they are not large, and the object was far too high in the sky to have been obscured by any of them. That is, in my opinion, simply not a possibility. I observed the object in its banked position for perhaps fifteen seconds. As to its distance from me, that is very hard to say. I would estimate that it consumed three or perhaps four solar diameters from my perspective: similar to holding three stacked quarters between your fingers at arms length. My gut feeling is that it was quite close, because I saw it in such great detail. If it had been far away, atmospheric haze would have obscured some of that detail. I could literally see the degree of polish on its surface. This afternoon, 19 July, I called Air Traffic Control at El Paso International Airport. I spoke with an air traffic controller, asking him if anyone had reported anything unusual on radar at the time in question. He told me that no one had submitted a report, but then he went on to virtually confirm my sighting. I made no mention at all of the fact that the object I had seen had disappeared\u2014he mentioned it. He told me that even if someone had seen something, IF IT HAD DISAPPEARED, they probably would have ignored it and not submitted a report. This seems to me to constitute some degree of confirmation. I am fifty-seven years old, a college instructor of Political Science, and had never before seen anything that I would consider a UFO. Frankly, I did not believe that they existed, though I was intrigued by the evidence. I will admit that since childhood, I have believed that we are not alone in this vast universe. But I never believed that we had been visited. I believe it now. \t\t\t",

I looked up into the sky as I was driving and saw two objects about a half a mile in front of me land distance. I was just coming to the intersection of Vista Del Sol Rd. and Lomaland Rd. to a red light. It was dusk (almost dark) and their was a large thunderstorm coming in from the north. I watched the objects as I was stopped at the stop light. There were two dark (blackish/dark gray) objects floating (best description) across the sky. They stayed the same distance a part as they traveled. They were moving sort of towards the thunderstorm, perpendicular to Vista Del Sol. There movement reminded me of the gyrocopter from the movie the Road Warrior. But they were not gyrocopters I don\u2019t think. Their size in relation to their altitude in the sky ruled that out as did their staying the same distance from each other. They sort of looked like they were being towed by something that wasn\u2019t there and they were just floating behind. They had no lights and made no sound that I could hear. They didn\u2019t appear to be moving that fast. I can not say how high in the sky they were but they didn\u2019t appear to be to high. As if a balloon at the edge of your sight or a low flying helicopter or plane but not low enough to see detail.. They appeared to be sort of (aerodynamic motorcycle not German WW II) helmet shaped with some sort of \u201cfoundation\u201d that protruded around the base. They had other protrusions but it was dark so you couldn\u2019t make out any detail. It was weird.  I turned right on to Lomaland so I could continue observing them. They appeared to start moving at a faster pace as they were getting nearer to the thunderstorm. This is based on the speed they were going at the stop light and where they were in the sky as I proceeded up Lomaland. I wanted to see if other folks thought they were UFOs so I pulled into the first apartment complex on the right. A young man about 14years old was there in the parking lot and I pointed at them and said \u201cDo you see those UFOs?\u201d He looked up into the sky and his jaw immediately dropped. He turned and ran towards the apartments yelling at his companion that there were UFOs. I drove another 10 or 15 feet into the apartment complex because I saw another guy looking right up at them. I said to him, \u201cYou see those UFOs right?\u201d and he said, \u201cYes I do. I wish I had a camera.\u201d I explained quickly that I wish I had my cell phone with me. I pulled up another twenty feet and by this time the objects were moving directly towards the thunderstorm. The thunderstorm was at least 20 miles off to the north. On the other side of El Paso International Airport. Within seconds one disappeared into the storm and then the other. I came home directly after the incident and as I was driving I didn\u2019t see anything unusual in the sky. I did see  two planes or copters over the airport as I could see their lights blinking. The whole incident lasted maybe 4 to 7 minutes.  I am a 44 year old white male. I am a wildlife biologist. I have a Bachelors degree and will complete my Masters this Winter. I have extensive scientific knowledge and spend much of my time out of doors, in the desert, from March through October many times at night. I am familiar with the southeast and southwest US.

It was brown, and \"cigar-shaped\".  I waited for its angle to change to determine if it was a helicopter (a common sight patrolling the border), but it's shape was too evenly \"cigar shaped\" so I was certain it was not a Blackhawk, and it seemed to lack the vertical stabilizer and wings of fixed-wing aviation, so I stood there and stared at it. It was not at a very high elevation, maybe 1000 feet above the ground (I'm not a trained aerial observer, so I can't gauge elevation at all), and it seemed to be just \"drifting\" over the border, like a dirigible, though it's path was even and consistently south-southwest.

The El Paso ridge is for the most part barren and too steep for anyone drive on. Only helicopters could get to where the lights were located. Description: I could not see the craft itself, but the light coming from it was extremely bright. In order for human technology to reproduce how bright it was, it would need to be a large collection of flood lights in one place. I could just see the very edge of the light source, before the shape of the light changed and appeared to actually be two craft crossing paths over and over again. As the lights moved around, it would cast a lingering haze on the clouds nearby that would resemble a lightning strike in the sky (the light did not flutter though like lightning does, it was constant). The color was pure white, this never changed about it. There was no blinking lights that would suggest man made craft. I live nearby an airport, and have become very used to identifying different craft in the dark. None of our craft can produce such a bright light that far away. I see this ridge every night at the same time, it has never been there before. So these lights were probably not caused by any sporting event (also why would you have a sporting event at 1:45 in the morning?)",

I am a twenty six year old Army Spc. stationed at Ft. Bliss, TX.  My Fiance is a twenty five year old accountant major studying in her final semester at the University of Texas in El Paso.  My friend is a twenty year old Army Spc. stationed at Ft. Bliss as well.  My fiance and I were at this friends apartment in central El Paso between the hours of 1830 and 0200.   The electricity in El Paso was disrupted due to a vehicle collision with a power transformer approximately around 0015.  Clear skies with stars brightly visible with a low smoggy haze in the south western end of El Paso.  We stepped outside to determine if other neighboring apartments had lost power along with my friends apartment when my friend noticed an unknown number of white/yellow lights traveling across the Franklin Mountain range above the western end of El Paso.  Pointing our attention to the western skies of El Paso, my fiance and he both witnessed the cluster of lights disappearing over the mountain traveling east.  I did not witness the lights due to a highway sign obstructing my exact view.  Not able to see the lights in the western skies I turned my attention directly to the skies above me and on an angle looking towards the east.  I then witnessed four dull blue/white balls of lights in a diamond shape pattern approximately two to three miles above me traveling east to west at an unknown high rate of speed.  The pattern of lights then slowed and came to a stop directly above me.  At that time I grabbed my fiance's arm and pointed directly to the lights above us. She witnessed the formation as well.  The four lights then seemingly holding its pattern turned directly straight to the ground the forward light now at the bottom of the diamond (creating the pattern of an upside down diamond), this all taking maybe two to three seconds. It within seconds of repositioning itself continued moving towards the west at a high rate of speed. As the pattern was heading west, the far left light darted directly out of the formation to a dis! tance ap proximately a half of one mile to the north east and then snapped back into formation within one second. The formation continued to the west until it was no longer visible. My friend did not witness these lights as he was still scanning for the lights that travelled across the Franklin Mountains. Five to ten minutes passed while we continued watching the sky above us as well as the skies above the mountain range. My friend then witnessed and called our attention to a dull dark orange ball that was only noticeable due to the street and parking lights below it. It was approximately the size of a seventy five centimeter exercise ball hovering one hundred yards above the ground, two hundred yards to the west of where we were standing, above a one story building. The ball darted slowly one or two feet to the left, then up one or two feet, then right one or two feet, it then slowly traveled away from us moving west at an very slow speed, possibly three to five miles an hour, until it was no longer visible due to the smoggy haze or beyond the street lights that were illuminating it. We continued watching the sky for an additional ten minutes until retreating back inside the apartment and out of the forty five degree night air.",

I looked in the rear view mirror to look at him them back at the road. That's when i noticed the star.  It seemed like it moved. It wasn't a shooting star or a meteor . It was just a static white light, no pulsing, no color changes, and no movement. While i was looking at it, it zoomed away.  This movement didn't look normal. The light smeared across the sky. The best way i can describe it is the way the stars look in movies when they go light speed. While it zoomed away the color and the shape were the same just elongated.

The last sighting I had was at my friends house far away from my house (40+ miles away) and it was the same thing I have on video which made me and my friend think it was following me.  The best way to describe this one is the shape of a couch pillow but metallic and it spins at a certain rate all the time. It moves in all directions and the wind has no effect on it but still spins at the same rate. I have this thing on video three different times.    Ok now for the best sighting, this thing had the shape of the Star Trek symbol but my best description of it would be if Batman had a jet plane this thing would be it.   I saw it in detail with my binoculars and could not believe what I was seeing, a batwing jet black with an oval tanish color body attached to the wing, no noise, no markings, no means of propulsion, stealthy.   My other sighting was right above my house on a Saturday noonish time.  I had just walked out of my garage to meet to friends and I looked up an! d there was two disc shaped black objects sitting still in the sky, wind was blowing some but they stood exactly still, both friends saw them also and then they just disappeared.  I also have what looks like a crop circle in my backyard in the grass.  My girlfriend who has seen the metallic pillow and I woke up one morning and we both said to each other it felt like we both had been in a very deep sleep, maybe like being tranquilized, one I have never felt before and the strange thing about it is we both told each other at the same time.

      "story": "Yellow ball of light following a commercial airliner. At approximately 9:20 p.m. on July 25, 2010, in El Paso, TX, I was on my apartment balcony observing an incoming commercial airliner flying from the east to west as it was making a descent to land at our local airport.  The night sky was clear, other than the clouds in the north.  It is difficult to judge the airplane's altitude, though I could see its underside in detail.  As the plane flew directly above my apartment complex, I noticed a yellow ball of light dart into a position behind the plane's tail where it began to follow the plane for about 4 seconds. The ball of light was about the size of the airplane's tail section.  The light did not seem to produce a noise, though it was difficult to know since I could only hear the sound of the plane's engines.  After it trailed the plane for a short time, the ball of light veered off in a northerly direction, and at times flew erraticly (suddenly slowing down, then speeding up). I estimate the light was traveling at least twice as fast as the plane. I continued to track the ball of light until it faded into the clouds in the north.  It was obvious to me that this ball of light was not another airplane, considering it was not displaying blinking lights, nor was it at a safe distance between the plane I was observing. This incident has great significance to me, especially having read about the increase in \"fireball\" reports recently.",

They were very shiny almost appearing as aluminum foil floating in the air.  They were very brilliant as they were visible in the peak of daylight. Weather: The weather was clear, and I do mean clear, I did not count a single cloud in the sky.  The temperature was approximately 87F, with the wind blowing less than 5 knots from the east.

There was also an air show underway at Biggs Army Airfield, the air show was NOT visible from my home.  The craft in the sky were not parachutes, as they did not descend they remained stationary occasionally ascending higher into the sky.  They were also not aircraft flares as they did not descend.

      "story": "Strange Orb above El Paso We were both standing in front of our house staring up at the sky looking for stars that don\u2019t blink thinking that those are planets.   I went inside to get my telescope to check some of them out.  We first saw what most people describe as a satellite floating way up in the sky.   Then I caught a flash in the corner of my eye and I looked up at the constellation of the little dipper.  To the right of it we noticed what looked like a motorcycle headlight coming straight down at us at about the level that most airplanes travel only this object had no red or blue blinking lights like a plane usually does.  The object had a bright almost halogen look to it then turned around within two seconds and it had a red glow at the end of it.   Within two seconds it began to speed away straight up into space and became smaller and smaller.  Most aircraft travel from left to right or vice versa.   This object turned around and went straight up and in seconds was gone.  There were no c! louds in the sky.   We heard not one sound coming from it.   A few minutes later a plane passed in the same area and we could hear the engines.  To me I have only seen what they show us on television.  This looked like one of those Orbs that people talk about.   It raced away into space after I pointed at it.  It was so fast that I cant describe anything on this earth that moves the way it did.   This is not a hoax.  We know what we saw.",

We discussed how shooting stars aren't that slow and we watched it fall. Once it fell close to the surface it stopped moving and turned into a white light instead of flaming. It stayed in that position for about 30 seconds and then disappeared. As we started to exit 375 to get onto 601 we noticed 3-4 cars parked along the side of the road. People were outside of their cars pointing toward the mountain.  As my husband and I looked over we same the same fiery ball falling toward the mountain.  This time it split into 5 separate balls, each did the same thing as the first.  They fell until they were closer to the ground then hovered once they turned into a white light.  Stayed light that for a few seconds and then disappeared.",

Then after a while it seemed to disappear and re-appear in the sky as it got further away.....shortly after that we came back outside and noticed four more of the very same objects flying around each other in zig zag patterns....it was very unatural to me and Ive never seen anything like these things...  These four seemed to be much higher and father away. we capture and focused on as many as we could w! ith our camera at that moment but they were very hard to focus on.....when those seemed to disappear in the sky a few friends stopped by and as we were showing them what we caught on camera....another apppeared in the sky going the same direction as the first.....we caught video of that one too.... The air traffic was very busy that day but this was nothing I have ever seen before.... There were no clouds in the sky except the cem trails from the passing just we get from fort bliss. These odd objects in the sky did not make any sound and seem to fly in a most unual pattern...my close ups reveal that this is not a plane of any sorts.",

I walked out of my house in the morning to get my cannabis which I had left in my car.  (I had not consumed any yet)  Being a winter morning, the sun had not come out yet.   I love to gaze at the stars and have been doing so since I was a child almost daily,  Sometimes for hours.  (Present age 28) I know the constellations and have and can distinguish stars from planets, plus I have taken some astronomy courses in college and stargazing has been a lifelong hobby.   I noticed a single round, reddish yellowish, greenish light in the sky which moved very rapidly and stood still, then moved again then stood still.  Then moved at a constant speed, then came to a complete stop and vanished slowly into the heavens, out of my sight.  It did not share any qualities that an airplane exhibits.   An airplane\u2019s light flickers at a constant tempo and the movement is constant and CAN NOT come to a complete stop in the middle of the sky.   If I had a compass I would say the UFO came to halt at a perfect North.  I did not have a compass so I am basing my observations on the stars\u2019 and the sun\u2019s movements.

      "story": "Strange star-like object hovering over El Paso mountains, almost hit car and swooped down below the road (on mountain) disappearing. I was sitting outside at night with 3 other people in my backyard. It was around 10:40PM or so, nearing 11PM. From my backyard I am able to see a view of the El Paso mountains in the distance, and am able to see Transmountain Road, which is a long road that is a shortcut to get from the northeast side of town to the west side by cutting through rather than going around the mountain.  From our view you can see the headlights driving by from the cars in a certain area that drive by, but they are high up in elevation on the lower half of the mountain from the view we have. Two of us (myself and another) were sitting in the backyard facing away from the mountain, while the other two were sitting able to view the mountains and transmountain road, and one of them noticed this faint light above the mountains, she pointed and asked what it was, it was probably a hundred feet above or so, not sure but it was high up enough to look like a star, because that's what we thought it was. Thankfully, she didn't believe it was a star - and kept staring at it and suddenly told us it was moving, so we all turned to focus on it, it was so faint we didn't think anything of it for a couple of minutes except it was this hazy purple, it was the exact coloring if you stare at a black light, you can't really focus on it and it had this purple tone to it.  We thought there might be a cloud in front, but it was a clear night, the object was hazy. So trying to focus on it in the sky, we can begin to see this faint purple/blue light begins to slowly move, side to side, diagonally, in very unusual patterns at different speeds, and then it began to slowly fly behind the mountain, and as we watched it, for about 5 to 10 seconds it went out of sight.  We thought that was all there was to it, but we stayed looking, we all kind of wished it would come back, and we got our wish... It suddenly came back up and began to float down the mountain but it moves down in different ways, at first it went straight down and then diagonally, just erratic movements and it suddenly gets closer to the cars that are driving on transmountain, so we see this faint purple light get closer and closer to the cars and two of us are really scared that it will crash down, but the other two people with me tried to get out a really bad telescope of mine that didn't work properly - but hoping to be able to use it to see what this object is!  Then it suddenly pauses in front of one of the cars, almost like the object hit the brakes and it lights up so brightly I squinted, and we all just gasped in awe and fear. Then immediately it shot down below the road into the base of the mountain near an area that has no residential homes, it shot down from the right, then to the left and then out of sight. Being so scared we were expecting to see it come back up into the sky, maybe even fly over us but thankfully nothing.  We called into the non emergency phone line in El Paso to ask if anyone had seen strange lights, and they told us no. After that, a day later we went up to Transmountain to see if we could see anything below in the desert, and of course we found nothing unusual looking. I've seen in the mid 90's strange objects in the sky over Ft. Bliss (military base) area which is east of where I lived, objects that would blink and shine light onto the roof of the house in front of ours (without any sound, like a helicopter light should have), but never have I seen this black light colored object, erratically flying around near where a lot of cars drive back and forth 24/7, and if it was anything government made, we wondered why it would be so close to cars, seemed dangerous.  I just wonder if the drivers on Transmountain saw the object, because when it lit up so bright it seemed everyone would have been able to see it!  But it seems nobody noticed it but us that night, and we stayed out for many nights after that hoping to see it again but we haven't yet.",

On December 3, 2014 I was sleeping and I woke up like other nights.  I saw the clock that is on my table near me and I saw that the time was 1:11am.  This surprised me a bit and decided to get up to go to the bathroom.  I\u2019m quite sure (because I was awake) I was in the bathroom two minutes.  When I return to bed, I look at the clock and it was 2:43am. I missed 1 hour 32 minutes.  I know I will not remain asleep in the bathroon because I remember everything I did.  This is very disturbing to me because I find no explanation.  Sometimes I can not sleep thinking ab\u00f3ut this and trying to find what happened to me. About seven years ago, I was living in Fort Worth, TX, and I had an episode of sleep paralysis.  That morning, when I woke up I could not move.  With great effort I could look at my husband who slept beside me.  I tried to scream to wake him and could not. I tried to calm down, closed my eyes tightly and when opened I could already move. Another episode I think was a sleep paralysis as well happened to me about five or six years ago (in Fort Worth, TX)  When I woke up this morning, my bed sheets were clenched as if some unknown force were grabbing the covers and pulling them down.

On 6 April, 2015, (Monday) at approximately 20:15 hrs, in El Paso, Texas, while sitting on my porch, I observed approximately 5 bright yellow/orange bright spheres of light (orbs) moving in access of 2,500 mph across the sky.  The brightly colored orbs did not glow and were approximately the four miles to the southwest of my location, over a suburban neighborhood, and four to five miles south of the El Paso International Airport at approximately 2,000 feet above the ground.   The orbs were about the size of a Volkswagen beetle and were flying horizontal to the horizon in formation.  As I was sitting down at the time of the observation looking towards the SW; the orbs appeared from behind a tree on my left and in approximately 2 seconds disappeared behind a tree on right and were moving from the SE to the NW.   I did not see or hear any aircraft flying in the vicinity of the orb sighting for at least another 15 minutes. I have been in the aviation arena for over 46 years, I was an Army helicopter pilot for 29 years and have over 6,300 hour of flight time of which over 2,000 hours were during night time.

In all my years of flying I have never experienced an orb sighting or head of any other aviation personnel discuss orbs. I remember viably the orbs of light that I saw on 6 April.  The five bright lights were flying in a straight line formation.  The four lights that were following the lead light were slightly accelerating and decelerating to maintain their relative position in the formation of lights.

I'm always looking up at the sky, looking at different type of aircraft that pass over, and can tell what kind of aircraft is flying, but on this day I saw this object that was pretty high, was just like hovering and glistening silver, and sometimes a glow of red after a few minutes it just moved left and stayed there hovering and gleaming silver a few seconds later a plane about the same altitude flew by heading north west a few seconds later the object was still high in the sky and was over Fort Bliss I tried to get a pic with my phone but couldn't, a few minutes later the object that was heading east of El Paso just vanished.   I have never ever seen any flying object that could just hover at that height, just totally amazing.  Thanks ((name deleted))",

      "story": "Huge Six Cubed Superstructure Seen in El Paso, July 2001. I observed a huge megastructure floating in the sky over the Franklin Mountains in El Paso Texas.  The event lasted for two hours and thirty minutes.   I was patrolling the parking lot of a mall, and I parked vehicle to update my DAR (Daily Activity Report), and noticed that huge cubed shaped superstructure in the sky and in a row of six connected to each other.  This structure did not move, nor had any visible lights.  The sun was at its descent and blazed brightly in the sky.  The light made the structure very faded as the moon appears in the sky.  The first two cubes were ornate and seemed to have depth in the design, the other four cubes behind it seemed to be plain.   I advised my supervisors of my observations.  It was so moving I asked my Director of Security if I should make an incident report.  He said not to.   I went to the Supervisors to show them what I saw, and they were dismissive.  Another co-worker advised me not to take it so seriously.  I was upset that it really did not bother them much.  I went into the mall and asked if I could borrow a camcorder or camera and their response was no.  I invited them outside to see this megastructure and they were very glib.  I then attempted to take polaroids of the structure and the sun white washed the exposure to be useless.  This megastructure remained in view for two and a half hours as the sun set. All edges of the structure were not sharp but rounded.  I wrote on DAR that, \"Reported an UFO to Supervisors and Director of Security, asked if Incident Report needed, and they said ,\" No.\"  My female co-worker who is now my ex-wife, told me to not make a big deal about it.",

I have 20/20 vision so to me this object looked perfectly round and I saw bright orange and red flames surrounding this perfect circle I kept talking out loud narrating to my friends how this was definitely no ordinary ufo sighting so this is why I say it took at least 4 min.  Unfortunately I didn't want to go inside and get my camera I was enjoying the ufo hands on very selfish like.  So now that time had past the object began to dim out and started to come down it reminded me of a hot air balloon the flames we're extinguishing and the perfect circle kept coming down vertically now at a slow pace after it was almost invisible and still falling down a second fireball appeared in the sky from where the same direction in the sky as when I saw the first one, this second object also reminded me of a hot air ballon motion only this one floated across the sky horizontally to the left but with great speed very quickly it flew to the same location the stopped above when it reached the same location as the fist object as if it was trying to catch up to it but instead of extinguishing it flew itself straight up into the sky perfectly straight up and up and up until puff just like that we couldn't see it or anything else after that.  So what happened to the first one?  Did it land??",

      "story": "Two solid white lights in a straight line formation silently moving to the NE across far NE El Paso Located in far Northeast El Paso, near Railroad Dr and Farah Dr, while star gazing, two solid white lights appeared overhead out of nowhere and moved in a straight line formation, one behind the other, to the northeast for just a short distance for about 5 minutes and disappeared. It was a clear night with no clouds.  It was a calm, windless night and there was no detectable sound from the lights passing overhead.  There were no associated blinking or colored lights as on an aircraft. The lights were brighter and more focused than stars, and were flying at an altitude far lower than high planes yet higher than any low planes.  The lights moved straight ahead with no side to side movement, and traveled too fast to be a high altitude plane or a satellite, but slower than a low altitude plane. The lights were in a straight line formation too far apart to be just a single plane.  Although no associated shape was detected, it seemed as if the lights were positioned with one at the front and one at the back. What was so startling and attention-getting was that the direction of travel was entirely not in keeping with the normal flight paths of either ELP or Biggs Army Airfield, nor of the high altitude commercial flight paths crossing El Paso.  The witness is a nightly observer of the constellations and the local commercial and Army flight paths across Northeast El Paso.",

      "story": "Saucer 50 ft. above hovering over us. It was a summer night in Texas in 1972, I was 11 years old at the time.  I remember very  vividly the local news channel my parents were watching saying there were strange sightings of flashing lights in the sky around town that were unexplained.  It didn\u2019t seem very alarming to my parents at the time so being kids, we were not very concerned, just kind of excited to see them. \tMy sister and I went outside to see if we could get a glimpse of any of these so called lights in the sky.  She was 6 at the time so of course she followed me.  We went out to the back yard to see if we could spot any, it was around 5:00 PM, so the sun was still out.  It was about 15 minutes and we didn\u2019t see anything so we decided to sit on the brick fence and watch for a few more minutes, nothing. \tWe were just about ready to jump off the fence when we spotted 3 flashing lights in the distance, probably no more than a few miles away.  They were still and were like flashing orbs.  We got excited and jumped off the fence (it was a small brick fence) and were going to go inside to tell my parents when all of a sudden we heard a humming from right above us.  At that point we were in the middle of the back yard.  I looked up and to my amazement, saw a ribbon of round flashing lights not 50 feet above us. It was a disk, sort of like the flying saucer you see in comic strips.  The lights were different colors and they were flashing around in circles.  It must have been no more than a few seconds when I looked at my sister to see if she was seeing the same thing.  She had fallen to the ground, passed out. I was scared and shook her to see if she was OK.  She opened her eyes and I heard a whoosh. I looked up and the saucer and gone.  Both of us were shocked and couldn\u2019t talk. She got u! p to run in the house to tell Mom and Dad.  I stopped  her and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mom and Dad, they won\u2019t believe us.  This is just our secret\u201d.  Surprisingly she did not say anything that night, or even the next few days.  I had dreams about that evening for days, not bad dreams at all, just like it was watching over us. \tYears went past and we didn\u2019t tell a soul about that night.  We have two sisters and a brother and kept this all to ourselves.  She was very young so I thought she just forgot.  I had so many dreams about that night and after all the years went by, I convinced myself it was just a dream. \tThirty five years passed, it was Thanksgiving and we were talking about when we were kids.  I mentioned a dream I had about seeing a flying saucer when we lived in Texas.  My sister flushed, turned as white as a ghost and said she had the same dream.  She explained her and I were sitting on the back yard fence looking at the skies when she saw flashing lights in the distance.  She remembers running and looking up seeing some kind of saucer with different colored lights at the bottm and passing out after seeing it.  She remembers me waking her up saying, \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mom and Dad, they won\u2019t believe us.\u201d \tDid we both have the same dream?  I don\u2019t think so.  I believe what we saw was real and deep in my heart, I know there are peaceful beings out there watching us.  Maybe knowing our hearts and letting us know we are not alone.
