And it moves like a greased rocket engine sometimes.  This thing seems to have a table shape to it, or it's a large helicopter shaped thing.  Where there is a red light in the video, the time I saw it before- there was a bright blue light dead center of the dark shape in the middle. There are 4 lights on the...legs.  It gives off the impression of a flying coffee table. Did I mention it is SILENT. I have footage of it (it is crummy, but, it's footage). You can hear the traffic down past the TV tower, you might be able to hear the cessna flying right over my head. You can really hear me snarl at the damn focus.  You'd think something as big as it is, flying at the speed it seems to be going, would make some noise. Nope.  The Cessna droning along was the only noise I heard, and that was weak. It's Unidentified (help!), it's Flying, and it's an Object. I am so on the fence as to what it is, my pants have creases.  If it made noise- helicopter. Both times, with the second time of me being dramatically closer, and no noise. I have very, very good hearing. I listened for all I was worth when I realized how quiet it was- Nada. I think it disturbed the air as it went by. If this is some secret military thing, whoever is flying it should be shot. I'm waiting for one of these hotshots to hit the stupid TV tower. They get THAT CLOSE.",

      "story": "Oval shaped glowing white object leaves a trail of 'smoke' in the sky then vanishes . I observed one oval shaped craft heading easterly in the sky. At first it appeared to be a jet of some sort but it was moving sporadically in the sky in a continued forward motion (up and down). It let behind a trail of \u2018smoke\u2019. At this point I was thinking it was some sort of meteorite or maybe a fireball. The color was white. As soon as I came to this conclusion is when the object stopped in the sky and it appeared to have some sort of white haze, almost like a fog develop around it. As soon as this happened the trail of \u2018smoke\u2019 ceased to be produced. The object grew brighter and moved ahead then absolutely just vanished. I was able to record about 2 \u00bd minutes from my cell phone. The initial event that caught my attention was not recorded because I was really dumbfounded by what I was looking at in the sky. As soon as the object started to disappear is when I started recording so the video only shows the faint object and the trail of \u2018smoke\u2019 which shows the trajectory of the objects movement. I took one still shot when I arrived to work that only showed what was left over from the \u2018smoke\u2019 the object produced. It was oval in shape and had a bright white glow. I could see no details other than the shape and the glow. Its shape was very distinct and it did not have wings from what I could tell. No blinking lights or anything of the sort that would make it identifiable as a jet or a helicopter. The sky was clear and it was in fact dark just before sunrise. I will email the photo and video evidence.",

      "story": "U.F.O. seen over Greensboro, N.C. , unbelievable sighting of a Bright glowing object in the sky. Myself and my friend were sneaking out when we were teenagers I'm now 29.  We were meeting 2 girls in my neighborhood and were going to walk up to the local Circle K convenient store.  Well, we met up with the girls halfway, and started walking up to the store.  The neighborhood was a very large suburban neighborhood outside of Greensboro, N.C. close to the Piedmont International airport.  I can remember the night there so vividly, the cars had frost on them that would glisten under the street lights. It was such a cold night, but we were having fun sneeking out walking up to the store, we were about 14 yrs of age.  On our way to the store we were all cutting up having a good time when my buddy who was a jokster to say the least, all of a sudden said ya'll theres a U.F.O..  My initial thought was he is such an idiot, until I looked up and couldn't believe my eyes, their in the dark sky a little above the trees was a huge Bright yellowish oval object slowly careening above the trees.  We all in utter disbelief stood there and gazed at it.  Like I said, it was oval in shape sort of like a football stretched a little.  It Was completely glowing a very illuminated yellowish color, with a little blinking light at the front of the U.F.O. according to the direction of movement. Itwas approximately a quarter mile above the ground about a half of mile from wher we were at.  Without saying a word we all started running toward the object, but all of a sudden it simply vanished leaving puffy pink trails only to be seenin the city and moon lights.  So, with exubilation walked to the store and met w/ a friend who had a driver license and car and he picked us up to go riding.  We began to tell him of what we witnessed, and he sort of just laughed it off until he turned on his radio and radio DJ announced that a bunch of drunks on a Saturday night were calling in reported U.F.O. sightings, but we knew better because we were not drunk and definetaly not crazy. Our friend believed us after he heard the ra! dio DJ. Oh yea, forgot the object was also moving extremely slow and made no noise.  That is what I remember like it was yesterday.  Thank you for reading my story and keeping an open mind.  I could't tell you what we saw that winter night many years ago, but I would sure like to know.  I bet the Government knows.  Thank-You.",

In the moment I was thinking, \"Okay, the tranformer just blew out,  I am about to loose power and all this work\", I heard  about 2 seconds later a close intense LOUD hishing-whooshing sound,  as if something passed over head and down. Then in THAT moment I  thought, \"Who's firing an illegal-grade bottle rocket\". Upon hearing  a second LOUD boom that shook the ground enough to notice, not violently,  I thought, \"Oh My God, has a house blown up?\". I turned to look out  the window to my west because the motion lights came on outside  due to the movment of the taller shubbery in a stiff sudden breeze. It was aleast a 20-25 mph gust from the north. The sonic incident  lasted a total of about 7 to 9 seconds, and there was no light of any  that I noticed. The gust of wind was short-lived. I was headed for  the telephone, so I did not time it. Fearing a gas leak/explosion, I called 911. This was at approximately  3:20 AM. The operator did not even ask details of my home address,  however, she did ask if I was near certain streets in my neighborhood. Within 30 seconds numerous police and fire vehicles were headed into  my neighborhood, and I went out to see and speak to an officer, telling  exactly what I experienced. My husband was asleep, but was awake when I  called for him, he says something woke him, but he did not know what it  was. He did mention feeling a tremble or shaking. He was upstairs. At 3:30 AM my neighbor was walking from the north end of Woodlawn Avenue,  to his house at the next block south. He does not wish to be identified. He is a retired, very well educated professional in educational and  technical fields. He was awakened by the second loud boom, percieved that  it was at ground level, and had headed down the street because he was  sure someone's house had blown up. We dicussed, I told of the preceding  boom and whoosh-hishh, and that strange wind gust. It was very cold, and  I went inside, and called your hot-line. Police and fire sirens were continually heard from 3:20 AM to at least 4:45 AM by me, going all around the surrounding area from downtown to  northern Greensboro. I checked the weather conditions, because I wondered that this could have  somehow been a meteor event that was somehow without visible light. The  ceiling was 3500 feet and below, winds were 5 mph, the clouds were thick,  the humidity only 44%, temperature was 29 degrees F. I am 50 years old, well-educated I suppose, and a professional musician. I often work at night in my home. Unless someone tells me otherwise, I  know that first BOOm was above ground, sonic in nature, and am doubtful  that it was produced by military aircraft. My father was a pilot, and  in the 1960s we grew up under a sky where the military practiced sound  barrier breaking. That whhosh-hisshh was a descending sound. The second  BOOM was near or on ground level, the floor did shake. The wind, possibly,  associated with the event, I can't be sure. There is an expansive park in the area where, from my perspective, this  event concluded, and the fast wind came from that area. As of now, no news  of damage, explosions, mischief, or anything else are known to me. If you  have more info or need more, please feel free to contact me. Thank you. ((names deleted))",

I live at college right now, and as I left my dorm for an evening snack, to be found in a different building, I saw a large, flickering light. (By 'large' I mean 'too large to be a star'.) The light was round and approximately 4-5mm in dia. Keep in mind that my dorm is roughly rectangular, three stories tall, and has a courtyard in the middle. All dorm rooms open towards the courtyard. So as I exited my room, the light was just above the line of the roof. My best guess as to cardinal direction would be West-Northwest, but do NOT treat that as anything but a guess. I can tell you that I could see the moon clearly from where I was standing, and that the light was below and to the right of the moon considerably. The light was moving slowly, but visibly, upwards. I would say it moved about 1mm up (to my eyes) every second or so; again, a guess -- I have a poor sense of distance. It kept changing color as well, and very rapidly at that -- at most, it stayed one color for 1/4 second, probably more like half that. Distinct colors were blue, white, and red, in that order. Very hazy, too -- its boundaries were blurry. About 1-1.5mm of its diameter was blurred. That's all I've got.",

September 28, 2010  Last night we had a storm that knocked out our power for 6 hours.  Before going to bed we decided to take our dog for a walk since the rain had stopped.  This was at about 8:30 pm.  As we walked the sky was strange.  It was as if the sky had been split in two as the low pressure system and dark clouds took up half the sky while the other was crystal clear with a blanket of stars.  Since all of the street lights were out the clear part of the sky was incredible.  I paused for a minute and looked up.  What I saw was a small white light traveling extremely fast through the sky.  It was apparent that this light source was extremely high in the sky.  It was a single white light with no blinking red or other colored lights. I watched it for a second or two then commented to my son and husband about the light.  My son looked up and immediately saw the light.  He agreed with me that it was traveling at a much faster speed than any airplane you could see in the clouds.  Several seconds later my husband saw it as well.  We watched it go on a trajectory from West to East and it probably only took about 30 seconds to completely cross the night sky.  I\u2019ve seen lots of airplanes in the air.  I\u2019ve seen the shuttle take off from the Cape in Florida.  I\u2019ve NEVER seen anything move that fast in the sky.  It was completely unexplainable.",

The white light, somewhat elongated, grew larger and brighter and then became dimmer and smaller until it was a very small dull point of light in a short amount of time.  At the moment it reached that stage I saw a similar dull point of light to its left, about the distance apart as two fingers at arms length.  This point of light was also moving very slowly but towards me, not away from me as the other now dim dull light was doing, as I could judge this looking through the branches of the tree.  I quickly went inside to get my camera and was back outside in less than 30 seconds and I could not see anyth! ing left of the two objects. I have an 10\" telescope and have enjoyed studying the night sky for over 16 years.  I keep an open and critical mind about this phenomenon.  I have studied the worldwide phenomenon of Crop Circles for 5 years and have read much of Colin Andrews, Freddy Silva, Nancy Talbot and others and well as the photographs by Steve Alexander.  I mention this only to show my openness to what I think is a tangible form of communication by other intelligences than from this planet.  My conclusions come from the preponderance of data that point to a technology that is able to channel several forms of energy simultaneously to manipulate plants to create extraordinary geometric formations within a timespan of minutes and no more than a couple of hours. These findings lead me to believe there are intelligences visiting us and gently trying to communicate to us through the use of symbols found in the Crop Circles. I have made no assumptions nor conclusions about what I saw. I am just relating what I saw. Lastly, just moments after returning with my camera and not seeing anything left of these dull moving points of lights, a jet airline with its blinking lights made its way towards my direction, following the established corridor for both civilian airlines as well as military jets, planes and helicoptors in this sector of the sky.",

      "story": "Broad daylight multiple color changing spheres My friend and i were walking down the street to the local store around ten o'clock in the morning. I heard an airplane that was particularly loud, so I looked up. I saw at first what appeared to be a single, sphere shaped craft that looked to be trailing the airplane.  It was \"silver\" in color when I first spotted it. As i followed the sphere trailing the airplane, it suddenly stopped. I mean it just stopped moving and was perfectly still. I couldn't believe my eyes.  Suddenly, the sphere began to turn baby blue as if it were reflecting the sky.  It wasn't an immediate change at first, but more like an exotic lizard--it didn't take more than a few seconds. Subsequently, it then changed from blue to the most amazing green that would describe as emerald, then red. When changing colors it gave the appearance that the craft was \"wobbling\" as the craft would begin the color change at one end of the sphere and it would make its way to the other side. The best way i c! an describe it alternately is like a modern lighthouse that moves its light beam in a circular motion parallel to the ground, almost like an old fashioned police car siren. I was pretty much just standing in the middle of the street completely mesmerized.  About 2 minutes into this I see another sphere that shot by the stationary sphere at incredible speed. I then moved my focus to the new object. It was identical to the first. In order to keep up with it I was pretty much just spinning in circles. I then see another sphere catch up with the fast moving one (#2). They flew in tandem for a few minutes or so and then suddenly reduced their respective speeds to half that of a conventional aircraft and it was at this point that I noticed the silver appearance began to fade as the crafts began to oscillate and change color, still adhering to their formation. Very spooky. In all I believe that I saw 4-5 spheres--but given their intermittent high speed and hovering behavior, it is hard to say precisely how many there were in the air at that time. Definitely at least 3 as at one point there were 3 craft in my field of vision. The funny thing about all of this is that during this whole experience there were still airplanes that were fl! ying either to or from the airport nearby. The craft just seemed to effortlessly avoid the airplanes and at times they appeared to be chasing them, only to turn around and shoot off in another direction. The whole event lasted approximately 20 minutes as one by one the spheres just seemed to disappear. They didn't fly off into the horizon but just kind of vanished instead. This is the second UFO that I have seen...both sightings within 2 years of each other. Both were here in North Carolina, one in Greensboro and the previous one in Snow Camp, North Carolina which is about a 45 minute drive from Greensboro.",

Not being very good with direction, I can just say as I was facing the sky, the full moon was just starting to be visible among the tree tops, to the left.  I saw four pulsating orbs (reddish-orange in color) -- for lack of a better word -- in a rectangular formation, quite spread out.   They were moving very slowly from right to left and faded away as they got to the point where the moon was just becoming visible (about 6:05 p.m.)  As I continued watching, one-by-one orbs were \"launching\" from the same point at the horizon line and traveling, again, from right to left.   At this point, none of them were in a formation, but just kind of slowly traveled until they faded away.  I would guess there were about 15 of them.  Luckily, I was able to get my neighbor to come out and she observed the same thing (with the exception of the first rectangular formation).

But my first experience with UFOs was when I was around 7 years old and did not see anything, but my father did. The time of this sighting is an estimate.  I know where I lived at the time of this sighting and I was probably seven years old.  It happened early in the morning, and I was not in school, so I am guessing it occurred during summer vacation. I remember my Dad and I were riding in his Oldsmobile 88, and we were traveling east on I-85 near Groometown Rd. in Greensboro, N.C.  I know that because we had just left my grandparent\u2019s house on Groometown Rd., they lived just a quarter mile off the highway. It was a very bright and sunny morning, and the sun was shining directly in our faces.  Suddenly my dad became very excited and started shouting, \u201cLook, look!\" and pointing to his right which would have been southeast.  I turned and looked, but I was blinded by the glare of the sun and could not see anything.  I have very sensitive light green eyes and have squinted all my life when in sunlight. I said, \u201cWhat is it Dad? Where is it?\u201d He kept pointing and said, \u201cLook, just over the trees there!\u201d   Again, I looked in the direction he pointed, but I could not see anything, and again the glare of the sunlight was giving me difficulty seeing. Then, my Dad said, \u201cIt\u2019s gone, it flew away.\u201d I asked him what it was.  My Dad told me he saw a bright silver cigar standing vertically come up out out the trees to our right, it leveled off horizontally just above the trees, and then just flew away. It was a very short sighting, maybe ten to twenty seconds at most.  My  Dad was very puzzled at what he had seen.  He described it like \"a rocket\", a long silver cigar object, about the length of the trees it came up out of.  I am not sure how far away it was, but I got the impression it was very close. We heard no sounds. So, I did not see this object, but I believed my Dad.  He was a very serious and sober person who did not often joke around. He was not one to make up stories at all.  My Dad (passed away in 2009) was a very intelligent and educated man, he was a radar technician in WWII and served aboard an aircraft carrier.  He worked as a civilian for the military as a radar technician until he retired, so he was also very familiar with military aircraft. That\u2019s about it, this was my first experience with UFOs.  I saw others years later in Florida where we had moved as a teen, and yet more in Connecticut where I have lived the past 23 years.  But this first experience I did not see anything.

It looked just like Jupiter maybe a hair smaller but just as bright.  It was moving very, very slow across the sky no blinking lights.  I started to video tape it and my girlfriend was giving me a hard time saying it is not a UFO so I only captured some of it going across the sky.

I do have the video of it before it took off into space!!  Nothing nowhere, no lights could be seen it was gone.  She looked at me and said, \u201cI guess you were right! \u201d WOW!

That was a very cool sighting!!!  Living out by Belews lake near the Duke Power station a bright orange sphere the size of a large Bradford pear tree flew a 100 feet over our house.

A week later around 8:00pm I heard that same helicopter so I told my wife quick I hear that helicopter let\u2019s see it.  We ran outside and leaned against the deck and watched over our roof line waiting to see this loud helicopter.  It was getting louder and louder then we saw a large glowing orange sphere it was very peaceful not a sound when we saw it you could not even hear it moving in the air above us and it was only a 100 feet.  It moved like mercury very fluid then it went over the trees. Then we saw the military copte! r and it was as loud as can be.  We even saw the pilot look down at us with in a black visor helmet.  It was the type like Blue Thunder back in the day with the gun turret and small wings on the side.  They were flying straight towards the power station!  That was cool!!",

Living less than a mile from PTI airport I first thought it was a plane with an engine on fire.  It was low in the sky like a plane that was going to land in a mile or less,and seem to be traveling about the same speed as a plane.  We had around a 45 degree angle of site at it's closest point to us.   Object was fire orange and seemed to have an aura,object was sphere shaped.  This object made no sound as it passed over the woods behind us.  This is when we lost site if it.   This was the first time either of us have seen anything like this.",

The other 3 objects were considerably smaller to the south west in line with the first object.  They were all stationary except for the one closest to the largest one we had originally seen. It slowly drifted upward. Kind of like a balloon would float up.  We watched them for about a half an hour with no major changes and then had to come in for the night.  I've never seen that before but it scared me a little because my daughter told me about 2 weeks ago, she was woken up by the sound of a jet and looked out to see a red &quot; fireball moving harizontally across the sky and I told her it was probably just a falling star, but now I wonder....",

One of the globes was moving side to side, and forward and backward within the V formation but not travel outside of the interior of the formation.  There was no noise, and no blinking lights.  Color was very similar to sodium vapor street lights.  When I first saw it, the object appeared to have a rigid v shape.  As it aproached I was able to see the object moving within the V formation.

No flashing  lights, and it was not in the path I am used to air traffic flying  over.  Airliners that travel over my area are  going on the North to South route at  around 40 thousand ft.  They are much dimmer and move quicker than this  object. Even at that height, the flashing navigation lights are still obvious.  This object may have been a satellite but from my memory of viewing Iridium satellites or the  ISS they moved much faster.  This object was so slow I wasn't sure it was moving at first. It was moving from North West to South East.  I first saw it  directly overhead.  By the time I was sure it really was moving slowly, and not my imagination, I began to be sure this seemed unusual.  When it got to about 45 degrees going South East it quickly faded.  It had been a very consistent brightness until that point.  It had no color or peak of  brightness as it passed over.  It was like Jupiter or Mars, but moving until it faded over a 5 second period.",

January 21, 2019, Approx: 00:45 AM - 01:10 AM Greensboro, North Carolina Guilford County   During the duration of my viewing of the eclipse, I was glancing at the star clusters near Orion\u2019s Belt.  I was looking back and forth from the moon to Orion\u2019s Belt, numerously throughout that night.  After a while, all of a sudden, I witnessed three orange, hazy, glowing illuminations (ufo\u2019s?) near Orion\u2019s Belt.  I refer to them as illuminations because at first they had no defined shape, other than being three small, out of the ordinary, orange glowing shapes in the night\u2019s sky.  It almost seemed like they flew towards me from the constellation Orion because the illuminations got larger and seemed to get closer.  They weren\u2019t hovering directly overhead, but were hovering in the distance.  I\u2019m not exactly sure how close or far they we\u2019re from me.  I guess if you held a ruler up to the sky in front of you and measured the size of the object I would estimate it to be 7-8mm.  There were no small or flashing lights on them.  They slowly traveled together, horizontally, kind of side by si! de, but not ridged or in any defined formation.  They seemed to fly somewhat wobbly or unstable and with a slight bobbing motion.  One of the illuminations/ufo\u2019s suddenly veered left from the other two, somewhat erratically.  Almost like something was wrong. It then began to fade in and out, leaving an orange trail, then disappeared completely.  The other two remained solid and did not fade in or out.  A few seconds later the other two flew upward then vanished.  I would say my experience lasted for approximately 30 seconds. As they got farther away I could make out one faintly shaped saucer.  The sides were tapered and gradient with a contoured top and bottom. When this occurred I was alone, outside in my crystal/meditation garden, putting out all of my indoor crystals to be charged and cleansed by the super blood wolf moon and total eclipse.  My crystal garden is comprised of three 3\u2019 amethyst geodes and three large 1\u2019 quartz crystals positioned triangularly and in an equilateral formation.  Basically like an invisible hexagram.  In the center of the hexagram is a birdbath with a 12\u201d quartz crystal that I often refer to as my receptor.  Surrounding the receptor are various gemstones and crystals.  The crystal garden has natural indigenous quartz stones surrounding it, as well in many other parts of my yard.  I feel it to be a powerful point of energy, both physically and spiritually. Also, for the past year or so I\u2019ve been instinctively drawn to that constellation.  Practically 90% of the time when I look up to the night sky I immediately see Orion\u2019s Belt.  I don\u2019t have to search for it.  It\u2019s always right there!  Also, when I meditate or simply look at the stars, I\u2019ll talk to any light beings, whoever or whatever may be out there.  My spiritually is greatly influenced by metaphysical, esoteric, and humanistic/pagan philosophies.  Dr. Steven Greer\u2019s and other ufo researchers have also been, to say the least, eye openers to me. I\u2019m a 51 yr. old white male, self employed retailer and truth seeker. This my truth and hear-by swear upon everything I hold sacred that what I witnessed is true. With all due sincerity,  William P.",

In August 2019 about 8:00pm I was looking north at a Thunderhead in the distance from my home.  A speck in sky just left of the Clouds caught my eye.  It didn\u2019t seem to be moving so I grabbed my Binoculars and observed a brown object at an unknown distance and altitude.  Approaching aircraft in GSO where obviously closer so I would estimate the craft was 8-10 miles and around 10,000- 20,000 AGL.  The craft was turning while stationary and from what I could observe it had a hole in the fuselage but as it turned it became solid.  It looked smooth at some points but then as it began to move slowly towards the thunderhead it stopped turning and looked jagged.  Almost like looking like a rock.  It was brown or brownish the entire time and stayed at the same altitude.  My wife observed the craft with my binoculars for a moment but she couldn\u2019t keep a fix on it as the sun set.  It did give a slight reflection as the sun went down in front of the clouds but it disap! peared towards the east behind the trees.   I would like to note that the first observation through my binoculars the craft looked like a donut.    After about 3-5 minutes I never saw that angle again as it moved.",

      "story": "Strange craft on approach with improper NAV lights that disappeared in class B airspace In November 2018 about 6:30 at night I witnessed a craft on approach into GSO airport RW 32 on my way home from work on the 840 loop exit off of I40.  The craft caught my attention because of the lack of navigation lights in class B airspace.  The only lights visible were two red lights one on top of the other.  The craft flew over my head as I was driving.  I rolled down my window and I heard no sound.  The craft was about 300 feet above and as it was moving it would reflect as if light was being shined on the bottom portion but it was a pattern.   It did seem to have wings but the under fuselage seemed to be almost invisible except for the strange reflection.  I kept driving and looking for it to land but it veered off over West Market Street and disappeared.  I immediately called the Tower to ask what the craft was and the staff member I spoke with said they had just changed shifts and he had no knowledge that a landing happened.",
