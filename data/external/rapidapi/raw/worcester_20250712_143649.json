We were so stunned we couldn't even think to take a picture.  (Aaah)! He Swears it was his Mother As An Angel, as were just talking about her when it Happened.

On Hwy. 20 heading east, I took notice off to the left in the Worcester aria sky about what looked like 500 feet in the air I saw a disk shape object that looked to be about 60 or 70 feet across. It was like a bright pie-pan shape and it seemed to be turning. It looked like a pie-pan in the sun and someone were turning it from right to left very fast. It was bright silver in color. As the sun shined on it, it looked really bright.  I looked it for about  10 or 15 seconds and I was about to pull my car off the road to observe it more when it was like someone turned off the light. It just vanished out of sight.  As I drove down the road I would look for it and for the next mile or so it never re-appeared.  When I got home, I turned on the local T.V. station expecting some news on this event but not so. Later that evening I turned on the radio and no news about this.  I thought for sure someone else had to see this because it was right in the air above a crowded city, but nobody reported it that I know about.

I work for a radio station in northern Vermont and what I saw I will describe--it not that big a deal really.  There is a comet forgotten the name to lazy to look it up but a comet or fuzz ball like or bigger than the 7 sisters that I saw in the eastern sky. This fuzz ball was moving over so slowly but in odd directions to the rotation of the earth not making any sense.  A friend of mine alerted me to it and said hey go outside and check out the comet. I did and went out several times only to find that it had moved to odd positions and in weird trajectories that a comet would not normally follow.  My only conclusion is that it was man made perhaps a urinal dump that caught the sunlight similar to when you can the ISS or other satellites at night but then why would it move into the different positions over the course of the next hour and half.  It is the erratic nature of the movement. The sighting  took place this evening in mostly clear skies with good clarity on a cold winter night with temperatures in the 20s.

At first I thought it was a stray balloon floating because it appeared as a dark circular object. The object approached on a course from the south west heading to the north east, eventually going straight above my vehicle.  As it approached I noticed that it did not act as a balloon would, like dancing in wind currents or rotating on it's axis.  This object stayed on a steady course and did not vary it's speed, alitude or direction.  There was a breeze at the time that I figured to be appx. five m.p.h going from the west to the east, that I thought would make a balloon go off course.  When the object was about 200 yrds. from me, it was traveling about 20 m.p.h \" about the speed of a ten speed bike \" The altitude is hard to determine, but I would say that it about twenty stories high.  The object resembled a loaf of bread with a more rounded top and flatter bottom.  The color was of a dark bronze, almost charcoal with copper tints.  The rear of the craft had a concave circle that appeared like a crator but did not display any kind of propulsion system like a jet exhaust and it remained the same color as the rest of the craft.  The object passed by and had no noise at all.  When it continued behind me, it approached apartment buildings that were 200 yards away from me that are twelve stories high and the object seemed th be about twice the height of the buildings.

Checked again about 5 minutes later but it had moved right (west) and then about 5 or ten minutes later it appeared to have been heading (down) south and then it was gone.  The brightness was never dimmed.  I saw no shape to it, just very bright.  Neighbors thought it had a peak on the top (triangular).

      "story": "Four bizarre orange lights in the southern sky over Worcester, MA just after midnight. At 12:05am on Tuesday, July 22, 2014, I was driving south on Belleview Street, when I spotted a large, round, orange light in the sky to my left\u2026which works out to south-southeast.  Best guess is it was about 20 degrees over the tree line.  I first thought it was a star, but soon figured it to be too large.  Then I thought an airplane or helicopter, but still would have been too large for those kinds of lights.  It also appeared to be moving in a left-right-left pattern over a short distance, relative to the object.  If you google Belleview street, Worcester, MA, the little green arrow that pinpoints the road on the map is precisely where I was positioned at the first sighting. As I approached the intersection of Belleview and Chandler Streets, I spotted certainly three, and possibly four more orange lights sitting dead south in the sky, not apparently moving.  One was slightly lower than the first one I spotted, perhaps at 15 degrees over the tree line.  The other two I am certain of were considerably higher in the sky, one at 75-80 degrees and shading toward the southeast, the other at about 45 degrees, directly below the highest one. There were no other unusual objects near these, and they did not show any distinct pattern or shine light on anything near to them.  My car window was down, and I heard no sounds to possibly indicate their proximity to my position. I was near my home, so I gathered my head, and sped to grab a good camera.  By the time I got back, about ten minutes later, there was no sign of these objects in any direction. One side observation:  on my arrival to my driveway before getting my camera, I looked to the sky to see if they could be seen from my house, but in the general direction of where I saw them, all I could see was a vague pinkish glow behind the shadowed profile of trees and other houses.  Couldn\u2019t see any stars in any direction, so I thought it might be clouds obscuring the night sky.  When I returned home, disappointed and without pictures of anything, at about 12:30 am the glow behind the silhouetted houses and trees was gone, and there were a good many visible stars in every direction. I hope someone else reports this so I know I am not nuts.",

One object was ahead of the other one and slowly making distance, when out of no where the one trailing behind sped up quicker than a bullet and caught up to the one ahead.

Complete silence. I know for a fact that my phone had full battery, but as soon as I pulled out my phone to record the objects my phone died and I couldn't.  Objects seemed to cause a small type of electrical interference as my phone stopped working but my car turned on. Also, when they were passing by, for the whole 5 minutes they were in sight swarms of birds were flying and making much noise and multiple dogs were barking.

Tonight, (8/12/2015), I was stepping out onto my porch, (I live on a third floor), at various times of the evening looking up at the sky and watching for anything unusual. At approximately 9:15 p.m. or so I stepped out onto my porch again.  As soon as I stepped out and closed my screen door I looked over towards my left which would be North East I believe and saw one pretty big ball of light which seemed to be a very bright orange color descending at a phenomenal speed from North East to North West.  The light was very noticeable/visible and seemed to be very close, (not much higher than the trees that surround the area where I live), and heading down towards the ground.   All of a sudden the light just disappeared completely.  There was no sound at all during this except for a few cars driving by my house. I could not have been the only person in this area to see this as the object was very visible in the sky. I have seen shooting stars before but it has been three years or so since I\u2019ve seen one.  To the best of my memory shooting stars are much, much higher in the sky and are also very different in color from the object I saw tonight, and certainly not as visible.   The object I saw moved so fast and disappeared so quickly that it was over and gone in a matter of seconds. I don\u2019t know what the object was that I saw tonight but I was very excited, and a little in a little bit of fear.

It was difficult to see at first until it got closer and we noticed it was changing shapes and went from one object to at one point up to 5 distinct objects flying together morphing and so on.  I thought at one point it was a helicopter carrying something, then realized it wasn't.   Then a totally red helicopter appeared from nowhere which is in itself unusual for us, we have never seen a red helicopter in our city, ever.  The helicopter appeared to be hovering above us watching this U.F.O!  When I finally uploaded the video and took a closer look WOW ! I paused the video at different intervals and captured those as images and the zoomed in closer, and unbelievable.  We seen many different symbols within what appeared to be like an invisible bubble around each of the objects many of the symbols were crosses.  One in particular when it was three objects each had a different symbol, a cross, what appeared to be an image of a d.n.a strand, ie. double helix, and the third looks like a person kneeling down on their knees praying.   I will send original video, along with a couple of the different images we get out of these ufos. It was truly amazing.  My wife was a real sceptic until this happened on the anniversary of her grandmother's birthday, leap year day.

      "story": "Wobbling orange disc, vanished as if responding directly to me pointing at it, very strange. 2 witnesses, including myself. I was smoking a cigarette on my fourth-story apartment balcony, and I looked up and out over Coab Reservoir.  As I looked upwards toward the sky, I noticed a wobbling disk was roughly 500 yards away. I had an eerie feeling that it was observing me.  I called my girlfriend over from the kitchen/living room next to me. I pointed to the saucer, and she saw it too for about 3 seconds, and it disappeared before both of our eyes.  We are both certain that there was not even a silhouette against the night sky, the lights weren\u2019t shut off, it simply disappeared completely.  It seemed to begin cloaking immediately as I pointed to it, as if responding to the confirmation of my awareness.  To describe it, it was a defined saucer shape which wobbled quite a lot, almost as if teetering on a small center of gravity.   It had maybe seven visible yet dim orange lights around the outermost lip, and they were evenly spaced.  It has been about a year since this happened, and I felt th! at the undeniable and strange encounter was worth reporting, later rather than never. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",
