We were freaking out a bit because we knew we were witnessing something out of this world. then after 15 mins the silver disk began moving slowly to the right and in back of the trees i said before and never saw it again.

      "story": "multi-colored swirling illuminating lights (looked like a tornado in the sky)   The incident that happened to me was in 1969, Dade county Florida.  I was four years old. I don\u2019t know why I remember this but I do. It was at night and my family and I was doing what families do watch television. Suddenly, the lights went out and I guess there was a noise or something outside because we all headed out of the house. There was something in the sky swirling around with illuminated lights which were multi-colored lights. It (the object) had no form.  After looking at it for, what I can\u2019t remember, a while the air around me felt thick, as if I were under water because I felt like I was moving in slow motion. I also remember my uncle standing in front of me but not moving or speaking. It seemed as though he was frozen in time; I kept pulling at his shirt trying to get his attention but he didn\u2019t move.  The next thing I remember is touching some kind of machine with lights all around it and it was very cold. From what I can gather now thinking back it seemed to me to be a probe of some kind. Now, the funny thing about this whole thing is I thought that I was dreaming, except for this one thing, I wasn\u2019t. I say that because years later when speaking to a few of my family members we all had the same experience. They remembered exactly what I did and perhaps a little more. So, I wanted to report this incident in case someone else has seen the illuminated swirling unidentified object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

I was sitting on a boat in the middle of a small lake at night, with the boat light off, and my boyfriend and I  noticed five round white lights high up in the nighttime sky.  They were in formation---three together, and two together.   They seemed to be stationery, but could have been moving (they were very high).   We watched for a few minutes, amazed, then turned the light on in the boat.  Suddenly, two disappeared... then the other three!  It seemed as though they had noticed that we were there, watching them, and decided to take  off.   But they didn't seem to fly off----the  round lights just totally disappeared.    This account is my best recollection.   I was in my late teens, I believe.  We were not under the influence of any alcohol or drugs.

Everything happened about 10-15 minutes after the lights to the park were turned off.  While we were talking we were in a circle formation, the people that were facing south of the park were about 4-5 of us.  I yelled at the rest of the group and told them \"look\". We saw about 6 lights came close to each other forming one solid light for about 5 seconds. Then in a matter of 5-10 seconds the lights moved away, trailing from each other in every direction (going up and down until they dissappeared). About 6 of us saw the same thing from the beginning.

It was early evening and the sun was just setting. I was out in the back yard hanging clothes out to dry. I felt some sort of sensation on the backside of my whole body. I remember feeling as though someone was watching me or sneaking up behind me maybe. But I could feel something and what ever it was, affected my head and ears with some sort of humm. When I turned around to look behind me. There was this flying object just above the trees hovering. It was long and oval shaped, matallic metal of some sort and it was very quiet. I could feel its presence. I do not remember seeing any bright outside lights on the this craft. The side that was facing me had a transparent window which was as large as the craft. I could see beings moving around on the inside and I could SEE and \"FEEL\" them watching me, but I could not make any of thier facial feathers out. I know they were wearing gray clothing or were gray and I could see alot of small blinking colored lights behind the beings inside the craft, like a counsole of some sort maybe. Then I just went blank. The next thing I know,it is night time, it's dark out and stars are shinning. My sister is mad at me cause she had been looking for me, for over an hour or so. I told her I was in the backyard hanging clothes, like she told me to do. She yells at me \"NO YOU WERE NOT\" I have been looking and calling you, for over an hour, where were you because you were not out back? I told her I was in the backyard hanging clothes, but she did not believe me. I knew if I told her about what I saw it would only make things worse. To this day I have never forgot the incident and never will. My life has not been ordinary ever since. Thank you all for your time.

It turn 360 degrees and its beam intensify. It was looking for something. Then it turn off its beam and the light was so strong the cloud look like a neon toy when you turn the lights off. (glow in the dark)  it stayed there 30 seconds or so. It moved closer to us, then it move really fast like a shooting star to another place but it was still the same size. it hover a little (stayed put) Then it blasted into space and shrink right before our eyes and I lost it when I finally blinked my eyes. That my friends was the spacecraft (light) i saw. I did not see green men or machines it was pure light and pure energy. Its the first time i tell this to people besides my family. GOD is my witness I am telling the truth. There is life out there. I was lucky to be a witness to this. .... May you be as lucky as I was.

      "story": "1959 childhood encounter with a spherical, faceted object, that had landed in my back yard in Miami. It was some time in 1959.  I can't verify the date.  I was 5 and hadn't started school yet.  My family lived in Miami (our address was considered to be Opa Locka) but I would attend school the next year in Carol City.  We lived a short distance from the Opa Locka airport (then, a military airport).  Our home was not near anything but rock pits and cow pastures.  We lived on 1/2 acre lot.  Some time, in the middle of the night, I woke up.  I saw the cat was inside and followed her through the house.  She wanted to go outside, so I opened the door and I followed her outside.  I walked into our backyard and saw at the back corner of our yard a large dark sphere.  Curious, I went closer to see what it was.  The object sitting in our yard was about 40' in diameter and faceted - like a disco ball.  The facets were small and bevelled, but clear - like glass.  There was a lot of moonlight, so I could see the color of the glass appeared to be bronze.  There was no light emanating from it, but it looked like whatever was in it could have seen out the glass.  I became afraid thinking that a door might open (and maybe it did - because I have a vague memory of seeing a black ramp extend from the lower fourth of it) and ran back inside the house and locked the door.  (Back then we NEVER locked a door.)  The next morning, my mother asked me what I was doing up.  (I think my return to the house and slamming the door woke her up.)  I told her I was letting the cat out of the house.  She thought I was sleepwalking, she said the cat wasn't left in the prior night.  I can't remember if I told her what I saw in the back yard.  If I did, that too was probably written off as \"sleepwalking.\"  I may talk in my sleep, but I have not had any other experience with sleepwalking.  After this incident, I began having a recurring nightmare about being abducted by people who looked like my parents, but weren't.  I would be in the back seat of the car riding along with my parents, when I would realize they were different, not my parents.  I would jump out of the moving car and run back to my grandparents' home.  When I would get there, my parents would be there.  But, I could tell they weren't my parents either.  This recurring nightmare went on for about two years before subsiding.  I am 53, female, have a slightly above-average IQ, and that's it.  I have often wondered if there's a relationship between the nightmare and the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

This  was enough for the attendant and I to actually look at each other and confusingly ask each other what, was that? obviously if it was an identifyable object we wouldn't have questioned it, but we were honestly puzzled to what we had just seen which came and went very fast and with no sound only bright flashing lights.

I'm now 47 years old and successful in the Exporting of wastepaper to China, India, etc.   When I was twenty years old I lived in Miami on Collins Avenue facing the Atlantic Ocean from the 17th floor of my Grandmother's apartment.  I had the apartment to myself for the entire summer and it was time well spent.  I loved the beach, the girls, etc. I have ALWAYS been a morning person and remain so to this day.  I've never needed an alarm clock and rise most mornings before 5am.  I've never been into alcohol or drugs of any kind.  In fact I love my lucidity and enjoy my conscious life.   I was wide awake that morning and could not wait to step out onto the terrace to look out over the entire Atlantic Ocean and feel the sweet breeze of freedom that was my youth.  I was smart enough to know how young and free I was because I knew one day I would be who I am today and how hard it is to make a living and meet one's responsibilities.  As the Sun was rose to light the morning sky. a speeding craft came from way out in the ocean.   I knew instantly this was something not of our experience.  This triangular object did in fact stop at the shoreline and hovered about 75 feet above my vantage point from the 17th floor terrace.  There were bright lights on each point of the triangle and it just hovered there for what seemed forever.  It hummed just enough that I could hear it over the sound of the waves beneath us.   I was not afraid but felt glued to my fixed position as I gripped the rail of my Grandmother's balcony. What happened next remains forever in my head all these years because the craft turned on its right (my left) and sped off at such tremendous velocity and made a sound like a team of muffled Lions roaring in unison.  There was a faint liquid vapor trail and I could follow the craft with my eyes for the length of the coast until it then ascended into the clouds with a speed I can not comprehend or convey here.  This thing zipped away like nobody's business.  I never forgot it all these years. ! I'm fam iliar with Harrier Jump Jets and even witnessed Israeli fighter pilots doing manuevers over the Negev Desert when I lived in Israel.  I've seen them turn on a dime during arial dogfighting manuevers.  I was even buzzed by Israeli warplanes while working the fields of a Kibbutz and I know what F-18's can do. You don't hear them until they are already gone.   Nothing on this planet can do what I saw that day in 1980.  I've never told anyone except my Mother and my Aunt.   To this day I feel blessed to have witnessed something not from our imaginations but the reality of other life somewhere in the universe.   What a gift.  My best to all.

      "story": "Frequent lights in the sky sightings in Miami Florida To whom it may concern at NUFORC  I would like to report sightings in the Miami FL. Area from the last week of December 2007 through just recently as yesterday January 27, 2008. This the first time I actually had the guts to talk to someone besides my family about it. The first time me and my friend saw a bright steady light in the night sky we kind of freaked out sense we first thought it was a plain flying higher than usual but then it disappeared right in front of our eyes, we had our doubts, and a bit skeptical but intrigued at what we saw! On the first two weeks between the 6 and 8  of January 2008, we saw the many flashing lights not in a formation like military jets, besides the speed, the way they flashed, and making no noise what so ever. It didn\u2019t look like it was one object because after the first sighting of lights, later on that same day, we saw two more similar flashing lights on the same flight pattern. The lights were headed northeast on the right side of the constellation. Then after we saw those sets of flashing lights. My wife starring at Orion\u2019s belt for some reason, she noticed a reddish round shaped dimming light at a very high altitude moving slowly between Orion\u2019s belt and the a yellow bright star or planet in the night sky. I felt amazed and something made me keep a closer watch sense then. On the 23 of January, my brother and I were talking about the lights and I was hoping that he might have the chance to see something and at about 7:30 PM, he and his wife saw two pairs of flashing lights Identical to what me and my wife saw before. He pointed out that what was very weird was the way the lights flashed, he said they didn\u2019t look like anything he had seen before in his life! And just recently as the 27 of January, my family and I saw a bright light that appeared from no where and traveled right in front of us a very high altitude but close enough for us to see that it was no commercial plain nor did it make a sound! After 10- 15 minutes it just faded into the night and vanished. We were hoping to see it light up ! again, b ut it never did! So now after all these lights in the sky you can say, \u201cI definitely got me wondering why have there been so many sightings all of the sudden, in Arizona and Mexico recently and now Miami? It is difficult to  believe it and say, \u201cAh forget it it\u2019s a military plain or something man made! I got so many questions, such as if and when I see un-identifying lights again in the night sky\u201d! What to do? \tDo I take a pictures, or film it? \tDo I call the Airport and ask if they know what it is? \u201cWill they tell me if it ain\u2019t a plain? I don\u2019t think so\u201d! \tDo I call the news stations? And without a picture or footage, will they take me seriously, and will they report my call?  Listen I know I\u2019m not crazy, cause I wasn\u2019t the only one that saw them and couldn\u2019t identify what they were, so\u2026 I have an XL2 Cannon Digital Camera and believe me, it is fully charged and ready to get footage of these lights in the sky as soon as they come way!!!

I'm guessing the last Wednesday night of December, the 28th, or the first Wednesday, January 4th, about 9:00 pm, I was returning home with my 29 year old daughter after picking her up from church.  I looked out the window of our pick-up and noticed a large orange \"star\" or so I thought.   I said \"Look how orange that star is, I'm going to stop and check it out.\"  I was just looking at it with my window down at this point, then it started to move.   It was in the northwest sky and traveled a little south, then stopped, moved again south a little farther, and stopped again.  It just stayed there then moved once again,  I told my daughter I was going to follow it because it was moving again.  I was going down a street and I blinked the my lights several times rapidly and the object stopped.  I think that was just coincidence though.  I had to turn by that time to go around the block and when I looked for it, it was just gone!    This all happened faster than the telling.  It also moved rather quickly.  It didn't actually twinkle or blink but I got the impression of something swirling around it like air maybe.   When I got home I asked my husband if there is any standard aircraft that would behave like this did. He said not that he's aware of. I told a woman I work with about the incident and she said her daughter seen an orange object once also. Report taken by the Missouri Investigators Group - B.

I felt like it was watching me.  I could not move.  I was scarred stiff.  I told my parents about it in the morning; they said I saw the street light.  I remember I had scoop marks all over my arms that itched.  My parents told me it was from mosquitoes and gave me some sulpher soap to wash with.  (In 1975 some one called in to a local TV show and reported seeing the same light in the same neighborhood in 1952.)   In 1958 I went camping at Crystal Springs, Florida, and awakened the next morning with scoop marks allover my right elbows.  In 1959 I awakened on morning and had the same marks on my inner thigh.",

I turned to the side to tell my friend to look at it when it was stationary and my friend looked up and then it speeded off. But he also was able to see the UFO.

      "story": "Red/White Ball seen from Passenger Plane, 4PM, over Miami Int. Airport, Memorial Day 06, approach. Object was witnessed by airline passenger, port side, facing Easterly.  On final approach to MIA, at about 3:55 PM, while plane was making final 180 degree turn, at approximately 4 to 3000 feet altitude, a glowing red-white ball crossed our path.  This crossing was below us, at approximatly 2000 feet, and at the general center point of the radius for which our airplane was turning around.  This fire-ball appeared to be traveling northbound, paralleling the SR-997 to the East.  If we were traveling at 222 mph, I estimate the ball was traveling 120 mph.  No change in vector was observed of the ball.  If I were able to have streched out my arm, and pinched my fingers together and opened them a bit, the gap would have been 1/4 to 3/8 inch.  If that ball was 1500 feet away from my eye, it might have been 10 to 15 foot in diameter.  The lumens given off pulsated strongly from red to white to read, with no observed briliance disipation.  Wether conditions were overcast, no direct sun.  Thunder clouds were starting to form at that time, and sky darkened by the 5 oclock hour.  No rain fell at airport, and no thunder or lightening was abserved by me durring the 2 hours I remained at the airport, awaiting a connection.  85F, cloudy, still air.  I made special effort to disprove what I was seeing.  I do have 20/20 vision, and I am not color blind.  I was not drinking or druging at the time.  I witnessed this ball for more than half the duration of the 180 degree turn the aircraft made, aproximately for 45 seconds.  The angle of the object, with respect to the floor of the aircraft, was just below the parallel of the floor, and drifting rearward.  The object left my view when we continued across its path and onward to the airport.  Below where the ball was seen are active surface mines, with associated lakes of varying shades of green to grey.  These may be cement or sand or shell bed mines, I am not sure.  It was labor day, and 4 of the 10 mines there showed activity with dump trucks and conveyors.  The mine imediately below the object did not appear to be active.  The plane was full, and I was in seat 32A.  I was interested in speaking with the pilot, but the cabin was still shut when I exited the plane.  At the time, I did not feel the need to wait for the pilot, for I needed to catch the next plane, in a different terminal.  I also thought he'd think I was insane.  I did not feel alarm while observing this ball, but I did feel like this may be a ufo probe mapping the planet running concentric passes, around and around.  No powerlines were visable to me in the area.  I have e-mailed a MapPoint sketch of the area where it was.  As I write this I have thought of possible glide path markers that would indicate were pilots need to turn for approach at night.  This is a good piece of doubt to ponder.  It was daylight out, and I did not see any tower structures at all.",

These white lights really caught my attention, the weather clear with and with good visibility. They appeared to be very close, maybe at about an altitude of 10,000 feet. They did not move for about 2 or 3 minutes then one of the white lights started moving, breaking the formation and making a straight line formation. Then suddenly I saw several other smaller lights (star-like) appearing in the sky and moving towards these 3 big white bright lights, some were steady and others were traveling at fast speed. I was able to count at least 25 of them, but I saw more appearing from the north east, it looked like it was an invasion. I\u2019m a private pilot and I\u2019m 100% sure that it was not an plane nor an air show. I have never seen anything like that before because of the way they were moving,  and clearly it couldn\u2019t have been a plane because there were no red or green blinking lights. Whatever it was it seemed as if they were observing us. After a while about 10 to 15 minutes later they all starting moving and dispersing from the sky; my friend was trying to take pictures with her camera phone but the resolution was very poor. I later went back to our office and I tried to contact the FAA to report it, but I was not able to get in touch with them, I called the 24 Hour Safety Hotline at 800-255-1111 and all I got was a recording but I never left a message about this incident. I hope this report is helpful to you, and should you find something relating to our sighting please let us know.  Kind regards, Mauricio Diaz",

      "story": "I saw various small flying disks traveling together and that looked very much like toys. The sighting happened today during traffic hours in a very busy avenue.  I first saw a small flying saucer that looked very much like a toy.  The center circle moved rapidly, but the outer disk did not move.  It had a blue blinking light bulb on each side of the outer disk and I noticed that the direction of the object was well centered to the lights.  That is, that the lights were always on the side of this flying object as if they were the wings of a plane.  I immediately thought it was a remote control toy but what really caught my attention is that this one flying saucer was followed by another one, and another one after that, etc.  There were about 5 or 6 of them flying together one after the other.  They were going slow, at about 25 miles per hour and bordering the backyards of the houses that were parallel to this avenue.  They were flying parallel to the avenue.  At this point, I still thought they were kids playing from the backyards, but when I noticed these disks were not turning around, I realized it had to be something else.  They kept on going along the avenue. Two of them went up and moved slightly to the right and I was able to keep them in sight until they were two microscopic dots in the sky. I know that someone else must have seen it because this happened in the middle of Miami during traffic hours.  The objects were small, about the size of a large round pizza which led me to believe immediately that it had to be a toy.  I can\u2019t imagine that it could be used for traveling.  I have never heard of such small size aliens.  I imagine that they could be used to scan an area, etc.  All I know is that they were small; they traveled at a steady pace and about 25 miles per hour and very close to the trees.   They were gray in the center section which spinned and black on the outer disk with blue blinking lights. I still find it difficult to imagine they were space crafts because they really looked like a toy.   However, I can\u2019t explain how they were able to travel for such a long distance, especially the two crafts that went up in the sky until they became unnoticeable.   I am still shocked and would love to understand what happened.",

They hovered where they were for approximately two minutes when my friend asked if I was seeing what he was seeing. I said yes, and then we started trying to see if they were reflections from some lights in the pickup cab.  I hung my head out the window and the lights were still in the same position.  They seemed to be rotating clockwise very slowly, almost imperceptibly.  We both watched them for another minute or so when they disappeared.  My friend thought they just blinked out, but I thought I saw them zoom away to the northeast at a speed that made them seem like they disappeared.  The lights never really did change colors completely to green but seemed to shimmer and have a green tinge.",

      "story": "These objects were not known man made aircraft. On January 10 2009, 2110 hrs, I took a break from watching a movie (paused it) and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I enjoy looking up to the night sky especially on clear nights when clouds are at a minimum or none are present (the latter applies to this event) and visibility is excellent. On this night I was smoking my cigarette when I noticed a commercial and most likely civilian aircraft making its aerial maneuvers for approach for a landing at Miami Int\u2019l Airport. This is typical at the area where I live since aircraft traffic is directed through this area for landing approach. I did not think too much of it given the fact that I see aircrafts performing routine maneuvers on a daily basis. On this night, however, I noticed two objects flying through the night sky (no particular shape) in a constant formation on the background (relative to the aircraft making its northward turn) of the commercial aircraft. These objects were being displaced at a relatively high velocity (or speed, since their general direction and displacement seemed constant). At first I thought that I was seeing \u201cthings\u201d and removed my eyeglasses and cleared my eyes. I went ahead and put my glasses on and saw the objects again. The commercial aircraft had a northward direction to while the objects had a general northwest heading. Military aircraft came to my mind in trying to identify the objects but no audible noises were emanating form the objects and no beacon/strobe lights were visible. Unless there are stop secret military stealth aircraft out there flying hypersonic with silent engines (especially at the altitudes these objects were flying) that the civilian population does not know about, I think this classifies as a UFO event. Furthermore, as they traveled in their direction (by the way, one object was leading the other by approximately a couple of thousand feet,  at approximately a 30\u00b0 elevation, measured relative to the trailing object) their emitted visible lighting was fading. I am very skeptical about UFO sightings and associated reports on the tabloids. The main reason is probably because I am an engineer and to me almost everything in life has an explanation through engineering and science. This is the first time in my life that I have encountered a physical event that I do not know what to make of it. By the way, I am certain that these objects were not satellites. I am becoming more convinced that we (habitants of planet earth) are not alone in the universe.",

      "story": "these crafts were not planes. I don't recall the exact date, but I have witness these crafts twice, on November and on December 2009. It was between 7 and 8 pm, it was dark already, some clouds. I was having a smoke on my balcony which faces west. I see planes almost every day far and close, so I know planes. I lived for over 8 years near the Miami International Airport, before I moved to this new place. I know airplanes, how they move their colors, the sound, just the way they move is enough to tell me that what I was seeing that night were not planes. They move too smooth and no noise, the color of the lights also was different. Planes are required to have green and red lights so that it is possible to tell if they plane is approaching or getting farther away. Those crafts I saw had no lights like this. What they had was lights bluish white which blinked, like on and off, on and off. They just felt strange, this is the only way I can describe. After seeing planes all my life, these jus! t were different. Now they were traveling from my left to my right, since my balcony faces west, they were moving from south to north. There is nothing south except the sea so go figure were they came from. My first sighting of these strange crafts was on November probably mid November 2009. Then in the middle of December, I was smoking again at around 7:30 pm and I saw them again, this really stroke as fancy, I mean do they do this every other day? I have not seen them anymore. There were maybe 5 to 7 of these things, they were not in any kind of formation. I would say they were in a circular formation, if you can call that a formation. Both instances I saw them at the same angle of view, I would say 60 degrees, I think, with the horizon being 0 and straight up from my head being 90. It is hard because I live in the fourth floor. There used to be a base down here, the homestead base, but it has been close since the mid 1990s. Now I want to tell you about another sighting I had a few years back, the reason is that that craft was also coming from the south. This craft I saw in this occasion I got to see its shape, it was a charcoal triangle, not black, dark but it had a sort of blue around it. This was seen by 4 people, including me. We saw it and then some one said, that is what people see like UFO don't you think? No nose and the same smooth going which planes don't have, it is like they are not feeling the resistance of the air around them or something, this is the best way I can explain. I believe in the so call aliens, not only because of the sightings in modern times, but I think these beings have been coming and going way before man ever walked the earth. But I don't know why I have the feeling these triangles are \u201cMade in the USA\u201d just something. You have seen how the government can hide things like the stealth fighter, the blackbird SR71, and Aurora, we are talking technology which was developed 50 years ago, so imagine what they have now. When will we see this technology? As soon as they have a better one. I also believe that not all aliens come from this universe by traveling billions of miles, I think there is enough evidence to show some come from other realities as well. I guess those too fall in the alien category.  Can contact me if it is worth it.",

I was facing South as my boyfriend and I left Wal-Mart, when suddenly out of the clouds appeared what at first seemed to be a falling star, but then I realized it was not traveling too fast. So, then I thought \u201cok maybe it is a comet or meteor\u201d when suddenly what I saw it split into three white circles in a backwards \u201cL\u201d shape.  I was not too far from home, so I immediately called my dad and told him to go outside and face south. He saw what my boyfriend and I had seen, and then, it split into five circles. We were amazed and going crazy trying to figure out what it was. As we drove as far South as we could we noticed the five circles of light were vertically straight. Trees got in the way of my view, but when I managed to get another glimpse of it, it was horizontally straight. We saw a plane that appeared to be heading in the same direction and then it took a turn away from it. I am not sure it had to do anything with what we saw, but it seemed interesting. The five circle! s of light clustered a bit closer together and quickly faded out of sight. I did try to take pictures of these mysterious orbs in the sky in the duration of about ten minutes that this was going on, but my camera phone could not capture something at the distance of the lights, which I want to say was possibly twenty to thirty miles away. Relative to the size of full moon that was out at the time, I would say it was about one eighth of the size (and the moon was big and low around 1850 hours), or about three times the size of the North Star, or maybe even the size of a light bulb twenty to thirty feet away. I am sure more people had to see it if they were going south of Krome Avenue. This is not the first time I see something of this interest in the sky and I am certain that we are not alone.",

      "story": "ODD UFO OVER MIAMI Actually it was very funny and kind of scary at the same time:  Miami Florida at 5 am on 11/28/2008  I was walking my dog around 5:00 am at my home located at Miami Florida when I noticed thru the distance a set of strobe bright and colorful lights changing in sequence from the blue red and yellow colors, those lights were coming torch me at quit low altitude similar to a normal airliners approaching for landing. At the beginning it made me think that it was a chopper from the local news stations and since I live very close to the Miami international airport near to one of the landing runways paths it was seen pretty normal to me that an aircraft were low flying around the area. I am very familiar with the direction and altitudes of the approaching airliners but this one came on a very odd approaching from south to north instead of the normal west to east trajectory as I seen them all the times. Since my home is located parallel to the palmetto express way on the 79th avenue and 52 street  I thought that this weird flying trajectory aircraft was following the palmetto express way from south to north as some chopper news does sometimes. At the beginning I thought it was a jetliner but seconds later change my mind because the jetliners have a set of headlights or approaching lights at the front and also in the wings but this one does not have any of them only the very bright colorful lights blinking on a sequence like the police troopers cars. I was about to resume me daily routine of walking my dog when I noticed that my dog became a little bit nervous which is something not normal for her and I decides to wait until she decides to resume her sneezing of the grass as she usually does but instead she begin to look up to the approaching aircraft at this time very close to me over my head. I was the moment when I noticed that the approaching craft does not have sound as a jetliners or a chopper will have but it flies silently until it passed overhead  and I began to hear the sound of a jet engine passing over me but the sound does not really sound as a normal jet engine but more sound like if the sound came from a laud speaker or something producing the sound from the rear of the aircraft which make me look up and noticed that weird shape of this aircraft more like a oval wing with a black hole or opening on the center from where I guess the sound of the jet engine are being produced. The jet sound was very odd and sound more like it was played on a device to create the sound of the engine without being a real one or like if the aircraft or forever it was trying to camouflage itself by making people think that it was a real aircraft and not something else as it looks. At the front the oval flying thing only has the set of blinking lights but in the rear of the aircraft it has a two sets of yellow and clear lights and a huge vertical windows probably about 10 to 12 feet tall for 6 feet wide and those were about five or six of them all together. The windows run from side to side and the strobe lights were on set below the windows and one set above and here comes the weirdest vision which was the few figures of some kind of small and skinny people walking along side the windows more like if they were doing some kind of work because they were not looking out thru the windows but just more casual walking inside the aircraft. At this point my dog was very scared and she was trying to release herself from the leash and run away making obvious that she was very afraid for something. The figures or entities inside the aircraft were about 3 or perhaps 4 but nor more than 4 and the jet sound came from the aircraft was not making any air waves of any kind as a normal jetliners does I could compare them because just a few seconds after this craft has gone a jetliner approaches my area and I could notice and compare the differences between the previous sight into the regular and normal jetliner. After few seconds of this sight the aircraft disappeared over the near by buildings leaving me kind of shaking due to this one of the kind experience even thought my dog does not known what was it she acts weird before and during the sight and only became a normal dog after the flying thing disappeared thru the distance. At the front I did not noticed anything odd at all beside the strobe lights since I begin to noticed that it was something not normal only after the aircraft was almost flying over my head. Hope someone could explain to me what was it of perhaps someone has see something similar before.",

Large, long, hotdog shaped object seemed to float around right in the path of incoming airliners headed for MIA.  The long, cylindrical object was red or orange, maybe 100 feet long, and seemed to \"float\" instead of hover.  A 777 flew right past the object on its landing pattern, and therefore I was able to scale the object with a 200 ft long aircraft.  It also had a slight bend in it, lending to the notion that it was 'hot dog shaped'.  (It sounds funny, but ut us true! I couldn't believe my eyes; I had to hang up on my girlfriend just to watch this thing float over Biscayne Bay.   It eventually floated to an altitude that was so high I eventually lost sight of it.

Saw a shiny metallic object when first pulling into the parking lot so assumed it was a plane since it was the same relative size and shape as a plane and was reflective like the metallic body of a plane very visible in the afternoon sun. I parked, checked the craft again and noticed it had not moved at all.  I then assumed it was a blimp. But I do not know of any metallic blimps and this one was extremely reflective.  And it was not the typical blimp shape, it looked more like a large jetliner from the side profile but I did not note a rear vertical fin.  It also confused me since it appeared to be the same distance away from my position that I see the airplanes take as a path to land in Miami International Airport.  I was running late to class so I did not observe it much longer. If it was the distance I believe it to be, relative to my position= ~10 degrees CW from N @ 1 mile.  So it would have been almost directly above International Mall.  I know some stores fly balloons but this would have been very unlikely since planes take a direct path over the mall to land in the airport 3 miles to the east.  And it's altitude was roughly the same if not slightly higher than planes that use that path to land. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

      "story": "Bright lights hovering and going in and out of orchestrated formations I have been scouring for 2 days the web sites trying to locate a report on a sighting which my partner and I and several neighbors on our neighborhood saw on the night of October 10th, 2010 and finally found a reference on your site. I will describe what we saw and have been seeking an explanation for since that night. No news reports have covered it.  11:00pm (approximately)  My partner had just gone to bed and I, a smoker like to sit outside the front door and smoke a cigarette as I do not smoke inside. I saw towards the Eastern sky a large ball of red which at first thought was a low flying plane's headlights. I found this strange as the light was very bright red/orange rather than white. All of the sudden, the light split into 3 distinct lights, very bright, same color but shaped in a perfect triangle. The lights seemed to hover a bit closer then suddenly split into a perfect line. This all happened within a couple of seconds - that fast.  The one light on the end started to hover away from the others for a bit and then the others followed. I stepped out onto the street at this point and watched them hover ever closer until they were almost above me. Their formation kept varying.  Sometime they would regroup and then another would hover away from the other - off to the side and then the others would stay still.  The one away from the others would rejoin the line and then continue moving.  It was very surreal. I noticed at this point that #1) there was no sound whatsoever associated with them and #2) they were not part of one object but rather each a distinct and separate object as it was a clear night and I could see up into the very clear night sky between each object. I followed them with my eyes until they went over house and tree line and then disappeared. I could no longer see them but then I noticed way up in the sky, almost appearing to be part of the stars little twinkling red lights moving in a formation. Previously, the objects had hovered over me at about the approximate height of what you would think of a rescue helicopter flying - I'd approximate about 800 - 1000 feet.  The now appeared to be flying in formation as high as a jet.  Again, this all happened within seconds.  I thought that was the end and I was left thinking about what I had just seen.  Just then, I turned and looked back towards where they had come and noticed another line of same identical objects. I quickly yelled for my partner to wake up and come outside which he did. We watched first 3 then 3 or 4 more all line up and again, hover over us. Both were wondering what they were as our neighbors across the street pulled in from work and came out to walk their dog. We pointed the lights out to them and they too stood there with us watching the strange lights. More lights came - approximately 10 in total.  My partner and I also witnessed together the rapid ascend into the night sky. I had pulled out my 300mm lens and my Nikon camera to try and photograph them but because of how dark it was I couldn't get the automatic focus to focus in properly on the objects and allow me to take a picture. I was however able to use it as a telescope/binocular of sorts and catch glimpses of them. My partner also took note that they had indeed disappeared into the night sky and became far distant twinkling red lights which seemed to fly in formation until they vanished.  I've been searching on sites including youtube videos of similar reports and I have found the following which look identical to what we saw that night.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imtq1_OxqPE  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaBjkjndDUg  I hope you can shed some light on this subject.",

      "story": "Beams of Energy & Illuminated Particles, Rapidly Moving Clusters of Stars After 10 years of serious sky watching, I noticed the beams of faint light or illuminated particles for the first time on 12/3  from a 10th story apt in Miami. I had a clear, wide angle view of the entire horizon, north, west and south. At first I couldn't believe my eyes and then I thought it must be the rumored Project Blue Beam or a new and improved night time HAARP/Chemtrail program. Maybe a phenomenon like the recent one in Lu Shan, China, supposedly created by the city lights, and the atmosphere? So, when I returned to my ground level home, 30 miles north I looked into the clear sky,  I saw the same grids of energy beams and faint pinpoints of light that appeared to move rapidly at certain intersections where the suspended particles met.   The next day, at high noon, I went to an open field nearby, stood in the shade and voila! The sky was perfectly clear and blue, except for the thin veil of grey particles, suspended by waves of energy in a perfect grid pattern,rolling across the sky. Planes preparing to land at Fort Lauderdale airport appeared to be flying above the particle grid, so it could not have been more than a few thousand feet from the ground. These beams were visible to me for 3 nights and! 1 day and a freind who lives 5 miles west.  Last night, they became barely visible and today I see no particles or beams in the daytime sky.  Unfortunately, the beams are so faint during the day and night, I can't imagine you will see any photo evidence soon.",

On the evening of  the 17th of April, 2011 at approximately 5:40pm I observed 3 small points of light in the sky just underneath very dark clouds.  At this time we were driving west bound on SW 88th St (Kendall Drive) and the objects were high in the sky.  Since we were driving home I lost sight of them.  About 2 minutes later we arrived in front of our home, I ran out of the car to see if I would see the objects and found a spot  near the lake for a clear, unobstructed view.  It took me a few moments before I saw 3 star like objects in the sky headed in a north westerly direction.  They looked to be twinkling or flickering on and off and also seemed small and orb like.  As I stood there more and more began to appear. The weather conditions were very cloudy with dark to light grey clouds in the sky, but as you looked west it seemed to be clearing up and plenty of sun light was coming from the west.  I believe that the sky was clearing just over and around Shark Valley Everglades National Park.  I believe this is important because I realize now that this was most likely the cause of the objects appearing to twinkle or flicker.  They seamed to be metallic and able to reflect or shine light from this source.  In addition, I would like to mention, that it was not raining. The direction I was facing on the lake was north. At first all I saw were objects to the north that seem to just disappear  into the clouds once they hit the northerly point, but then I started to look further to the east and noticed that the objects would begin appearing exactly 90 degress from the north ( towards the east) and I was not able to track them coming in from further south. I also realized that the new local hospital was having its grand opening and started to think it might be metallic balloons from the hospitals grand opening.  Only problem was that these objects were traveling fast and appearing high in the sky in the east as a small twinkle and then, although small, as they traveled north east they would look slightly larger in size having enough mass I could more easily follow the objects.  Just to make it clear I was facing north and my arms spread to a 90 degree angle (left arm directly north, right arm east). I had to question myself about the possibility they were balloons and check myself, but I have seen runaway balloons and they were not.  The movement was steady and fast and they all seemed to travel along just right underneath the clouds. These objects seemed to be coming from a distance near the turnpike (5.4 linear miles)  on Kendall Drive from my home and traveling north east towards the casino. I also noticed airplanes on their normal flight path over the everglades near the casino area heading towards Miami International Airport for landing. In comparison these objects, I believe, were much smaller making them appear farther. From the moment they appeared on the east to the moment they disappeared in the north it only took the objects 30 to 40 sec from point to point. Some of them looked to be traveling a bit faster than others at times. In total I saw approximately 20. Please also note I could not hear sounds from these objects like you would fighter planes. Near by is Homestead Air Force Base, but had these planes flown by you can easily see it\u2019s a plane. I checked the wind direction on-line at:   http://www.usairnet.com/cgi-bin/Winds/Aloft.cgi?location=MIA&hour=06&course=azimuth   The winds at that moment and using a 6 hour forecast were all pointing east, from 3000 feet, and south east in higher elevations.  Had these been balloons they would be traveling against the wind. I hope this has been helpful.  My 15 yr old son was with me and witnessed seeing some of these objects as well.  I am a 34 year old female that works in the admitting dept at a hospital neat Miami International Airport.  I've had an interest in shows involving UFO's, but had never, till yesterday, seen what I believe were UFO's.",

A balloon, Blimp but as it got closer I saw a distinctive triangle with different colored lights. Red, Blue Yellow, and a little green.  But as it got closer I noticed that it was not only the triangle that the lights were lit.  But tiny little lines, not many but definitive lines of dimmer lights that were in the middle of the triangle. I called my wife to see and to get the camera.  We started to take pictures of the craft. And soon as the flashes of the camera were going off it seemed to move slowly in the opposite direction  north northeast.  Then went slowly upward into the clouds and now just blue lights were showing through the clouds.   I can send the pictures if requested.   It was 25degrees 37`2210\"N and 80degrees22`01,07\"W moving SSW,  then after the camera flashes NNE and upwards.

      "story": "Miami suburb night sighting of a silent, low-hovering obtusely-angled arrangement of reddish lights Back in 2007, on a clear August night, I saw something in the sky that arrested my attention. My eyes locked on it as I tried to come to terms with what I was looking at. I was sitting in my car, engine off, driver's side window down - across the field from the elementary school I attended as a child - smoking a cigarette and listening to the radio. By pure chance, I turned my gaze out the window and upwards as I expelled a plume of smoke from my lungs, and there they were . . . Four reddish orbs, hovering substantially low in the sky, as silent as the surrounding night. They were NOT equidistant from each other but nonetheless arranged in a matter that allowed me to conclude that they formed the frame of an aircraft of some sort. Their placement in relation to one another seemed to suggest, to me, to form a shape of a triangle . . . the lights themselves forming an obtuse angle, stretching from left to right. The four lights were more left to right than up and down, and again, were NOT in a straight line, but formed an angle. Upon first setting eyes on the spectacle before me, I immediately shut off my radio. I have no recollection of radio interference whatsoever. If there had been, I'm sure I would remember it. There was no sound of traffic in the distance, as it was rather late at night and I wasn't anywhere near a main road or highway but tucked away in a residential neighborhood, blocks from my own house. The object was dead-silent and hardly moved, if at all.  The individual lights themselves didn't budge, nor flicker, blink, dim, or brighten.  Their illumination was constant. After staring up in utter awe for a few minutes, I looked away and reached for another cigarette, found my lighter, lit up, and then returned my eyes to the sight, at which point the lights were much further up in the sky, retreating into obscurity (and thus not as bright as they had been), and soon disappeared altogether. My best estimate of the time duration of my sighting is 5 minutes tops. I don't know what I saw that night, and not being a professional in the field of UFOs I don't pretend to identify what I saq but just merely describe what I witnessed.  And I will say this . . . in the faces of all those that might henceforth attempt to explain away my experience as if they had all the answers . . . I SAW WHAT I SAW AND NONE OF YOU CAN CHANGE THAT.  When you stop and think about it, where we're at in reference to UFOs, that's really all that can be said about a UFO sighting, isn't it?

The light they emitted were the  color of road flares and were very bright. They would dim slightly and become bright again.

I could see the light appeared to be located at the bottom of the craft and there were no navigation lights on the craft. I have seen fighter jets flying at night and these did not appear to be jets. They were traveling at a speed slightly faster than a commercial jet and maintained a straight course except for changing altitude. I lost sight of them due to ground obstructions.

A few seconds later I noticed an object moving from (my) left to (my) right about 5,000 feet up around fast moving stratocumulus clouds.  It had no sound and no lights.  The moon made it easy to see the object but it was sort of translucent like glass so it blended in with the night sky and the clouds pretty well. It was moving pretty fast but not too fast to miss. It was shaped like an arrowhead so it was similar to a triangle but it looked more like this: >   I then lost it in the clouds and by the time it would have exited the clouds, it would have been too far away to spot.",

I was 8 years old. The UFO was watching me as I starred out my bedroom window. As It got closer I could feel them watching me, like they were probing my thoughts with a  great probing force.  I think they could feel I was scared and they mirrored back my feelings.  I  moved under the covers of my bed and became frozen unable to move. They took me out of my bed holding my wrists, were leading me down the hallway.  I screamed for my dad . Telegraphically they told me that he couldn't hear me, I believe everyone on my block was put to sleep. The saucer was round with a see through dome from the inside out. As they flew me to the mother ship, I remember vividly sitting down and afraid to let them think that I could see them.  I was scared and pretended not to see them.  There was one alien that wanted to communicate , maybe the navigator,  The two others were standing in back of him, watching and did not try to communicate ever.  We went to a larger ship.  I remembered the docking port. How we docked and getting on board.  The ship was larger inside that it appeared outside.  I had  physical tests with samples taken.  I remember the mesh floor and a small box next to the bulkhead, and the round top of the saucer fitting into the hole under the mother ship. I remember how big the ship was inside. They told  me when the tests began and over and over telepathically that it all would be over soon so just wait a little bit longer.. I think they populate other worlds with what they take, and  use you later on for reproducing a hybrid, from the two realistic dream/experiences, because I saw one recognizable abductee on TV., she was complaining about her experience of being used. I saw gray figures with no facial features separating and cloning DNA into multiple vials. They let me see the space view of the Gulf of Mexico at night, with the city lights from Orleans to Tampa.  They showed me a  ray gun that used static electricity.  The end of it had a shape similar to  a  filament that hangs electric wires from telephone poles.  I think if it misses your forehead it will make a light bulb break. All that happened when I was 8 years old in 1952 just before the UFOs flew over President Trumans Capital.

It was a special object which seemed to almost have an aura around it.  My sister and I were both looking at it when we mentioned it to one another. It drifted, very slowly, from east to west. It was almost slug like. As it drifted, it seemed to almost disappear at times but would regenerate right after.  My sister claimed to lose sight of it, but i maintained an eye on it. It did that about two times and just shortly after its last reappearance, its completely disappeared again. The most compelling thing about it was that there were ABSOLUTELY NO clouds in the area which it was in.  It was also nothing like an airplane in that it didnt have that distinctive shape nor did it have a trail. Which is a characteristic of airplanes that fly at that altitude.  It also moved so slowely that it was surreal. The closest thing that I could compare its disappearing and reappearing to, would be how a flat object with a lot of surface area is clearly visible, but when its rotated to a side view, its nearly invisible.",

I was next door and ran home and my mom and aunt ( who still lives there and is nearly 80 yrs old), were standing outside and several other neighbors and kids were looking up at this light and were stunned at its appearance.  The object flew literally above our neighborhood at maybe 2000 feet high at which time it stopped and turned into a large disk whose \"underbelly\" started to create a spinning white-bluish light in several perfect puls! es until the end, when it shot a greenish odd light that spun in an almost octagonal shape ( what haunts me most, as that color and light were not from Earth), and then disappeared without a trace leaving a greenish cloud or \"smoke\" in its place. It made no noise whatsoever.  My mom and I still talk about it and my son makes fun of my story, but to this day, I think about this incident almost daily as I cannot compare this to any thing else I have experienced.   I have never shared this story before, other than family members but saw similarities to events posted in October 1969 on this site.

      "story": "Domed Orb Craft with 2 green lights and shooting white bursts changes to Plasma Cylinder March 31, 2012:  ORB  AND  PLASMA  CYLINDER   On Saturday, March 31, 2012, my wife and I also saw two different objects in the corner of the first floor of our house. At approximately 7 am that day, our dog barked and she went to bring him outside.  When she went downstairs, she saw a glowing \u00be orb with a dome top and flat bottom.  It was approximately 2 ft in width and 1.5 ft in height.  The object had two vertical lights inside which blinked green pulsating light.  Facing the object, on our left side, bottom part, the object emitted bursts of very bright white light, some long and some short.  The object was located near a corner wall and appeared to be floating about 5 feet off the ground. My wife started to pray and started to telepathically talk with the object.  My wife thought it was some kind of heavenly angel.  The object seemed to respond by emitting the white bursts and more blinking of the green lights.  She was grabbing our dog at the time, and our dog had just had a stroke and was walking in a paralyzed fashion--  limping to one side real bad and falling down as she walked.  My wife asked if her dog can be cured.  The lights then began to blink a lot. After 15 minutes of observing and communicating with this object, she started to yell for me to come downstairs.  I ignored her cause it was Saturday morning and I did not sleep well the night before and wanted to sleep.  After 5 minutes of her yelling she came up and finally told me what she had seen.  I first went to the bathroom and then downstairs.  I was very skeptical. When I got downstairs, we did not see the orb but a small cylinder shaped object which I am calling a Plasma Cylinder. The object did not appear to have edges but seemed like a fluid object with constant movement inside and on the edges of the object.  Inside were multi-colored lights similar to plasma.  Each color was not unique and separate like a rainbow but more meshed like colored water and the water colors are constantly mixing.  It seemed to be full of energy with colors floating stationary in the air.  The plasma object appeared to be about 1 ft in length and 6\u201d in height.  It was about 5 feet off the ground near the same corner wall that the orb was previously seen.  The object then went directly through our wall to go outside.  I only saw the \u201cPlasma Cylinder\u201d object for about 2 minutes before it disappeared through our wall. Attach is a picture of the \u00be domed orb and the Plasma Cylinder.  We are also attaching a picture of our corner wall.  Please note that the orb/plasma object appeared between the left wall and the flower picture. Our corner wall is on the Western corner of our house.  At 7 am that corner is dark because light does not enter that corner.  We have also closed drapes on the Western window as well and that part was dark because the sun was just rising on the east side.  We know what we saw and it was not an illusion. Also, note that we were going to put our dog to sleep in a few days before this incident--  she could barely move and was walking sideways and constantly falling down.  After the orb left, our dog did not appear to have any symptoms of the stroke--  she was walking perfectly fine.  She is still sick but she now walks fine.  We were freaked out by this.  Many of our friends saw the difference in her walk and we told them what had happened.",

So tonight i went to Google and typed boomerang shaped UFO in Miami Florida and came across this site and saw that a woman saw exactly what i saw that night, i can't say it was the same night but it was definitely around that day, she saw it coming from the south towards the north and it was the same shaped as what i saw, it had small lights they looked like stars forming a boomerang shaped or v shaped.  here are some links of what it looked like. http://www.mufoncms.com/files/12493_submitter_file1__boomerangUFOGER.JPG   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIp_exFN_Ys",

On November 16th 1975, I was awake and looking out the window in my bedroom at the sky.   As I was scanning, and looking for different stars, I saw about 12 lights moving around each other.  Then the lights grouped into pairs of two, and went into different directions.  Two of the lights began to fly into the direction of my area, and then they began to come down and as they descended the light they emitted changed color.  As near as I can remember, they started out as white light, then red, then orange, then yellow, then blue. I lost site of one of them, but one came over the yard in back of my house, between my house and the neighbor\u2019s house.  The light was very blue and everything seemed bathed in that light. It was a craft that was mostly teardrop shaped. It had lights in the front and on top and it kept dipping slightly in the front, as it hovered there.  There was a sound, but I cannot explain it.  I have never heard it before or since.  I became terrified and I tried to drop down to the side of my bed and crawl under it, but just as I started to move, I saw a very bright burst of light and I think I was knocked out.  When I came to, it was around 4:45 am.  I was shaken, and when my Mother got up to start breakfast, I told her about it.   My Mother had turned on the radio and we heard the news man tell about a police officer in Dade land who reported a UFO. I have never spoken of this to anyone else, and was afraid to report it.  I did not want to look crazy.  I have never forgotten it though, and lately saw footage of similar lights on a tv show.  It prompted me, and I have now made a report of my incident.

July 8, 2012:  LARGE CRAFT  \tOn July 8, 2012, at approximately 3:30 am, my wife saw a huge craft, about the size of a football field, maybe double that size, about 1/2 mile from our house.  We live in the Killian area of Miami and our best estimate is that the craft was near or above the Miami Zoo. Our dog is very sick and throwing up and she went to open the door in front of our house so the dog can go to the bathroom.  When she looked up, in a south-westerly direction, she saw the craft at approximately a 45 degree angle. Attached is a drawing of the craft made by my wife.  It was shaped like a cylinder but with pointed edges on both sides which appeared triangular shaped on each end.   The right and left sides, inside the triangle portion of the edges, had two large bands of extremely bright multi-colored lights on each side.  The middle part of the craft appeared very light whitish or grey colored. The craft made an extremely loud noise, much more powerful than if an airplane was standing directly above us.  The object remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then it disappeared. We have attached a drawing of the object, a map showing the location of our house and the location of the Miami zoo area, and a weather chart indicating that the visibility was 10 miles, and that there were scattered clouds at 3:30 am that night.  My wife said that she saw many stars in the sky that night and thus she had excellent visibility. SUMMARY  \tPrevious to these events, my wife and I have never seen UFOS or other similar objects in our life. She is not bothered by this because she is very religious thinks that they were a messenger from God.  I, on the other hand, have been freaked out.  I started doing research on the subject, have joined MUFON, ordered about 30 UFO books, listen daily to Coast to Coast, etc, etc.  I never even knew that these radio programs or UFO organizations existed.   I am now consumed by the subject.  I need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that I became obsessed with this issue. Finally, I am an attorney with the IRS in Miami, FL and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  We live in a very nice upper middle class neighborhood in the Killian area of Miami, Florida.  We have lead normal dull lives until recently.",

      "story": "Red lights flying over Miami, Florida, December 3rd 2012 On December 3rd, 2012, at approximately 2:30am, I was driving south on Miami's 826/Palmetto expressway. I had left my best friend's house after watching a movie. While on the highway I noticed maybe 10-13 red lights in the night sky. Because my car was dustier than usual due to local construction, I had to roll down my driver's window to get a clearer view.  The red lights seemed so out of place I decided to stop the car and parked it on the emergency lane. They were fairly low, close to the western horizon and they were slowly moving due south.  They were spread out but maintained their places, all appearing to move at the same speed. They reminded me of aircraft in formation but the pattern was irregular, rather like a constellation's shape.  They were essentially red lights, and were only slightly larger than any star in the sky and they seemed to twinkle softly as stars do.  Because I didn't have a great camera on me, I called my best friend on my cell phone! and told him to run out and look west.  But as he was getting out of his apartment, they all began to fade slowly and one after another until they disappeared entirely. As an artist, I consider myself an extremely open-minded person. But I try to approach such situations with a rational mind.  I have never before seen anything like this in person.  I am also sure there must have been several people who witnessed this.  The lights covered at least a sixth of the night sky. While there wasn't a great deal of traffic at 2:30am, the city wasn't entirely asleep either.  Anyone driving due west on several roads would have seen these lights gliding overhead.  I don't drink nor do I take any hallucinogenic drugs and I was wide awake when I witnessed this. As soon as I got home, I immediately went online to see if there was any news of a meteor shower or maybe a satellite burning up and found nothing. I did find an article on a British news site of what is &quot;believed to be&quot; a recent meteor shower.  But the pictures show a phenomenon that looks entirely different.  I then googled pictures of meteors and similar events and again, completely different images came up. When finally going on youtube at about 3:30am, I searched for the terms &quot;red+lights+sky&quot; and found a few videos showing lights over Galveston and Farmingdale and finally found a match for what I saw!  While mysteries make life more exciting, explanations can be more comforting. I would very much like an answer to this one. It was beautiful but slightly unsettling.",

      "story": "bright orange-red firball, rose vertically out of fireworks (thought it was some special firework) then travelled horizontally silently I am a medical doctor and love watching fireworks like anyone else. I was out on the rooftop of the garage to my apartment complex in Country Club, Miami looking at the fireworks because one can get a great panoramic view from up there. I had been watching the fireworks for about 40mins so I knew pretty much the patterns/details of the various groups of fireworks from around the neighborhood. I noticed 3 orange-red lights flying about 8 miles away I would estimate.  They flew at the height of a plane about to land but their trajectory was horizontal, they flew much slower than a plane at that height and they made a triangular configuration.  I am pretty sure they weren't from the same object and that their formation made it seem like it could have been a triangular object. I went into my pocket to grab my ipod touch to take a video but i forgot it in my apartment and they went out of sight behind some buildings. This lasted in all approximately 10-15 seconds f! rom the moment i noticed the strange lights to when they went out of sight. I went back to my place to say goodnight and take out the garbage, but I found what I had seen so strange that I grabbed my ipod and went back to the rooftop.  I spent about 20mins looking at fireworks and then I saw the strangest thing I had ever seen.  About 2miles away (pretty close), another complex was having a display.  These were the closest fireworks to my location. What i thought was another firework rising to explode was the same colour fireball I had seen earlier, but much closer and brighter. Imagine looking at fireworks shooting upwards\u2026..naturally, you'd expect it to explode as per usual; this orange-red fireball kept rising and rising and then started coming in my direction. I kinda froze a bit then remembered I had my ipod and took it out nervously to video record it. I got about 4 seconds of it before it turned sharply to the right behind my building, but because I was on the rooftop I! was able to run along the top to see it in view again. It was! travell ing horizontally and then started making circles around where the fireworks were exploding. I listened very carefully to hear if it was a helicopter (with very weird bright orange lights) but couldn't hear anything. my battery to my disgust went dead and I only got a few seconds of it. I was so disappointed. After that, I saw the same thing happen again: a bright red-orange flare-like light come up out of where the fireworks were going off, not explode and then change direction from upward to horizontal to circular. This time the light was clearly pulsing, but randomly. It wasn't a predictable pulse, sometimes very very bright, other times very very dim to the point where you  could barely see it. I saw this 4-5 more times after this but these times the light (which was always alone) was just in the sky moving horizontally, then circling back around. It felt like deja vu each time and I kept saying out loud, &quot;what the fuckkkk is that thing&quot; I came down from the roo! f and walked as far as i could in the direction of the light (which was gone by now) to see if I could hear any noise like a helicopter which is the only explanation I had that made any kind of sense). There was not one photon of white light however, only orange-red and no sound. So I decided to google &quot;Fireball July 4th Miami&quot; and a combination of other key words and I came across this website. I actually sent my friend a text message after I saw the very first light at 11:27pm. This was the text: 11:23pm &quot;Dude r u looking at fireworks? &quot; 11:27pm &quot;I'm sure they're gonna be a lot of UFO sightings tonight esp since millions of eyes r in the skies. I swear I just saw the weirdest light in the sky. Thought it was a firework going up as usual but it didn't explode then started traveling horizontally. I got some of it on my ipod video. I followed it. It was bright red like a flare but traveling like a plane and pulsing, not blinking then it just faded and disappeared. WTF?!?! :s&quot;",

      "story": "5 individuals see Huge 300 ft Craft about 50 feet away for one hour.  Could throw rock and hit it. Early August 2012:  Large Craft seen by 5 individuals   I submitted the two earlier sightings to MUFON and to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I did not submit this following report because I believed that it was so unbelievable.  I only told this story to Mary Margaret Zimmer of the Miami MUFON when she visited me in late August of 2012 but to no other authority. I have been thinking about this event EVERY DAY since I saw it.  The most important item to retain in this quick summary is that I specifi-cally called this object--  it did not just mysteriously appear. After my wife saw the large UFO craft on July 8, 2012, I started to seriously begin my research on UFOs and paranormal issues.  I purchased numerous books from Amazon and spent all my free time on the internet.  I learned that many individuals (Steven Greer, Prophet Yahweh, and many others, call UFOS and then record videos of these objects. On a cloud covered night in the first week of August of 2012, at about 9 PM, a friend of mine called me and informed me that he was coming by and dropping off some of his traffic tickets.  I am an attorney and had previously told him that I will write up No Contest Motions to resolve these tickets for him.  He said he was close by and would be at my home in minutes.  I decided to wait for him outside. I live in a large cul-de-sac with only 3 houses.  My neighborhood has large yards and is very quiet.  It was dark and very cloudy.  I then decided to \"play a game.\"  I remembered the Steven Greer and Prophet Yahweh videos and started to consciously wish to see the large multi-colored UFO craft  my wife saw on July 8th to appear in front of me just like it did for her.  Approximately every 2-3 minutes I turned around 360 degrees to see if I saw anything.  I did this for about 15 minutes.  Just when I was ready to give up, I saw this huge object on top of my neighbor\u2019s back yard extending approximately 200-300 feet back. The object was not a solid object.  It was made up mostly of thousands of streaks of circular or oblong shaped white thin lights.  It appeared to me that I saw two possibly three distinct outlines formed by the  oblong perimeters of these white light streaks.  One circular object nearest to me was partially covered by the palm trees in front of my neighbor\u2019s house.   This smaller oblong object was connected to a much larger oblong object as formed by the perimeter of these light streaks.  There appeared to be hundreds of swirls of circular white light streaks all inside of this object. The object was positioned at a horizontal position rising at approximately a 15 degree incline.  It was positioned at about an 8 o\u2019clock to 2 o\u2019clock format.  It was about 50 feet from the bottom of the backyard of my neighbor\u2019s house to the bottom of this object.  It is difficult to determine its height but I would say that the object was about 100-200 feet in its height.  I was clearly very long, I would say at least 300 feet in length.  (Attached are Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7 which are drawings done by myself, my 10 year old daughter, my friend Luis, and his Wife Sandra). I then started yelling for my daughter to come outside.  My daughter had just turned 10 years old.  She had told my wife and I that both she and I had seen UFOs and she wanted to see one as well.  After about 1 minute of yelling outside her bedroom she came out and asked me \u201cwhat was that\u201d?  I told her that I did not know but believed it was a UFO in \u201chiding\u201d.  She just looked at the object in amazement. After about 2-3 minutes of observing this object, my friend, Luis, who is 48 years old, his wife, who is 52 years old, and the daughter of his wife who is 17 years old drove up to my house.  Both Luis and his wife were trained as engineers in their native countries.  Luis is a conservative Catholic who was raised in Mexico.  He goes to Catholic Mass every Sunday and participates in various ministries.  He never believed in UFOS.  Both he and his wife were shocked and constantly asked me \u201cwhat is that\u201d.  We all tired to come up with logical explanations but we clearly could not come up with one that adequately explained this phenomenon.  We all doubted whether this was indeed a UFO and discussed that it must be some type of large light \u201canomaly\u201d. Suddenly, all throughout the inside of the object, star light objects started to flicker on and off, flashing on and off in a fraction of a second.  I was surreal.  I believed that because we started to doubt this object, it wanted to put on a show for us to demonstrate to us that in fact it was very \u201creal\u201d.  It indeed was surreal.  We were not scared but instead started yelling\u2014 \u201clook at that, look over there\u201d\u2014pointing to the stars bursting all over the different parts of the craft.  It was clearly putting on a show for us, or at least that was my impression. After about 15 minutes, my friends said they had to go and they drove off.   About 5 minutes later I believed that mosquitoes were biting me and I told my daughter that it was time to go inside because the mosquitoes were killing us.  In fact, my daughter told me later that there were no mosquitoes out that night.  After about one half hour later, I \u201cwoke up\u201d and realized what a fool I was for just walking away from a scenario that should have been the front story of Time Magazine and every media outlet around the world if I had captured it on video.  I ran outside with my video and digital cameras but the huge UFO craft was gone. The ironic part was that about a month before this event, after my wife saw the huge multi-colored UFO outside our house, I purchased a large telescope, a night vision CCTV camera with adapters to attach this camera to the telescope, an old used SONY camcorder with the old night vision technology and a digital camera with high powered zoom for night shots.  I said to myself \u201cthe next time my wife or I see these objects we will be prepared to capture them on video and on camera so no one would doubt us\u201d.  We know what we saw and they were real.  \u201cNext time we are going to prove it.\u201d  \tThe irony was that it never even entered my mind to take any of these newly purchased items out and take a video or a picture.  About 30 minutes after I entered my house with my daugthter, I came to my senses and ran out with my camera and my SONY video but the UFO had disappeared.  I now have been educated through my various readings that I was \u201cinstructed\u201d to go inside and not to take any videos or pictures.  I have learned that various individuals having \u201cclose encounters\u201d have experienced similar responses\u2014 our minds were totally controlled. Since that first week of August of 2012, my wife and I have not seen any other UFOs or similar objects either inside or outside our home.  Every day I think about what I saw and have become compulsive over these sightings and these visions have affected my work performance and my outlook on life, our role in our universe, and our relationship as spirits with God.  I am a changed person. SUMMARY  \tPrevious to these events, my wife and I have never seen UFOS or other similar objects in our life. My wife is not bothered by these events because she is very religious and thinks that these visions were messengers from God.  I, on the other hand, have been \u201cfreaked out\u201d.  I started doing research on the subject of UFOs, joined MUFON, ordered and read about 30 UFO books, listen daily to Coast to Coast, etc, etc.  I never even knew that these radio programs or UFO organizations existed.  I am now consumed by the subject.  I need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that I became obsessed with this issue. Finally, I am an attorney with the IRS in Miami, FL and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  As I stated earlier, I have various advanced professional degrees in addition to my legal training.  We live in an upper middle class neighborhood in the Killian area of Miami, Florida.  We have lead normal dull lives until recently.  Now I am consumed with my visions and spend most of my free time on the internet, reading books about UFOs, alien abductions, consciousness studies, Near Death Experiences, paranormal and spiritualist literature, Buddhism, past life regression literature, etc, etc.  Over the last year I have purchased and read over 100 books on these subjects and have recently ordered about 30 more.  My wife thinks that I have become compulsive and totally consumed by my new pursuits and I tend to agree. I have just recently returned from my first MUFON meeting in Miami, FL and have a recommendation for the MUFON investigators.  Instead of solely relying on \u201cpurely scientific\u201d techniques and tools--  the principle approach which was conveyed to the audience\u2014 I believe that the key to solving this UFO riddle is to focus on our minds--  our complex \u201cconsciousness\u201d, our complex psychic abilities. The fields of parapsychology, involving the decade long studies by Drs. Harold Putoff and Russel Targ at Stanford and Dr. Robert Jahn at Princeton, in addition to the new \u201cconsciousness studies\u201d involving Dr. Edgar Mitchell and his Institute of Noetic Sciences, as well as the hundreds of other \u201cConsciousness Studies\u201d academics that publish in the Journal of Consciousness Studies, provide the keys to \u201cunderstanding\u201d this phenomenon.  I also recommend that everyone read materials from these authors in addition to the rarely discussed book entitled \u201cThe Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century\u201d, edited by Dr. Edward Kelly of the Department of Psychiatric Medicine at the University of Virginia. I know that I \u201cinvited\u201d the entities of this craft to come \u201cvisit\u201d me and that the \u201centities\u201d in this craft made their \u201cappearance\u201d upon my \u201cinvitation\u201d.  The key to solving the UFO quagmire is inside our own mind and spirit.  My latest event leads me to conclude that my mind, and other fellow human minds, are powerful and neglected instruments with powerful communication abilities. UFOs may not be from other planets in our universe.  They may be entities from a neighboring dimension as described in modern quantum physics.  It is very difficult to get a grasp what is going on with UFOs if one solely focuses on the \u201cscientific method\u201d.  The scientific method was developed to describe our physical universe and it does not adequately describe paranormal activities. Science has nothing to do with paranormal phenomena.  Science is based on the scientific method of discovery and experimentation.  The scientific method of discovery was devised for studying things in the physical universe.   Thus, when we are dealing with concepts outside of the physical universe--  things like the paranormal, UFOs, alien abductions, etc-- we are dealing with concepts outside of the physical universe and thus the scientific method breaks down.\t  \tNew methods and techniques of investigation have to be developed to study this phenomenon, and if we do not, the future UFO investigators will remain clueless.  We are now just starting to \u201cacademically\u201d explore the universe of possibilities beyond our physical senses to help explain what is \u201cconsciousness\u201d and various paranormal activities.  In my opinion, we need to be able to investigate beyond our physical sense of reality and it is this new methodology that will provide a logical avenue to address the riddle of solving the UFO phenomenon.",

      "story": "Red &quot;plasma&quot; ball of light traveling south to north over the Everglades, complete with tail/corona. Location: Miami, Florida (western suburbs, away from major light sources located eastward)  (Note:  This is the 2nd time in four months I have seen the EXACT same phenomenon in my location. I will include details of this event post-script. This was not a chinese lantern, as well.)   I was sitting outside with a friend of mine.  I glanced at the sky (Which I do out of habit), and my eyes focused on a single red dot of light.  Instantly recognizing this as the same object I saw four months prior, I stood up and pointed it out to my friend. We stood in awe as the following happened:  (Note:  This event lasted over one minute)  The object moved smoothly northward from over the Everglades (west from my location, about 5 miles from my house).  As we watched, we noticed a whiteish-reddish tail emanating from the object, flowing smoothly away from it.  The tail diminished, but given a closer look I noticed a corona of white vapor surrounding the red ball. The dot of light and its tail resembled glowing red plasma.  The object, from my limited perspective, seemed like it was moving as quickly as an airplane would from 30,000 ft up.  I suspect the object was actually located between 50-70,000 ft high, and probably moving much quicker than any airplane.  Despite this, it flowed smoothly from south to north over the Everglades. After about 45 seconds, the ball of light dimmed... then reappeared three seconds later. It dimmed once more, then came back, now with a strong reddish tail flowing from it (at this point it was parallel to me if I faced toward the west). Maybe 10-15 seconds later, my friend and I noticed the ball of light seemed to contain a small explosion, again very flowy and plasma-like. After this final \"explosion\" of light, the object dimmed, then suddenly disappeared, now located to the north of me (i noticed the light when it was WELL south of my location). We continued to watch the sky, but nothing.  Post-script: This has happened to me before.  Same location, but this time the light was travelling from north to south over the EASTERN sky (from my perspective, I can surmise it was flying over the ocean, outside the mainland Miami-Downtown area). Again it lasted over a minute, it had a tail (this tail was much more prominent and strange than the most recent event.  Very deep blood red, flowing well away from the ball of red light, creating what seemed like a Comet's coma/tail.)  The tail would diminish occasionally, the light would dim almost completely, flash bright again, dim, flash, then disappeared. I have studied meteors before in an attempt to explain this to myself.  I believe with 150% certainty, NEITHER of these objects were a meteor or aircraft of any kind.  There also seem to be many other reports of similar objects/events. I write this in an attempt to perhaps get some answers or even a little logical explanation as to what this MIGHT be.  Note: Miami has very heavy air traffic, with various types of commercial, private, military and helicopter aircraft flying at any given time.  During BOTH instances, other aircraft were in full view (I live near Miami International Airport.  Planes do holding patterns or final-descent approaches near my house).  This object did not resemble ANY aircraft or \"chinese lantern\"   The first time, I had no witnesses.  This second time, I have a legitimate witness that watched this happen with me. Thank you.",

      "story": "Large Unknown Stationary Object With Flickering Lights Spotted Outside Of Globe Arizona At approximately five minutes after midnight, I was on patrol in the copper and gold mine in Miami arizona.  I had stopped atop a hill and was looking towards the west, when I spotted a large group of lights (just one object) that appeared straight across.  They were flickering and I seen red, what appeared to be green, and white.   At first, I thought it was a large aircraft in the distance coming towards me but after observing this for approximately 5 or more minutes it was not moving.  It appeared to be hovering around an area we call top of the world, a small community 15 miles west of Globe, Az, in the mountains, very secluded area.  I judged the lights to be approx 15 to 20 miles away from where I was.   It was a clear night with many stars visible.  I contacted our main gate dispatch center at 12:06 am and told our on duty dispatcher what I was observing.  She kinda laughed and told me earlier that night at approximately 08:30 pm she was texting with her daughter and her daughter (13 years old) said mom I see a ufo.  She told her daughter yea right but she said her daughter told her she was being serious.   Now getting back to what I seen.  After the call to my dispatch (I was inside of my vehicle when I made the call), I went back out and was still observing this object still not moving lights flickering and contacted my partner at 12:09 and told him what I was observing.  He was approximately 5 miles away and told me he could see the lights also.  He said he was going to drive about 3 miles west of my location to try get a better view.   At approximately 12:11am, I noticed what appeared to be 3 helicopters on flying below, on above and one in front fly by the area of the first spotting and continued to fly south east towards the Pinal Mountains with the two in the rear flying a lot slower.   I got back in my vehicle to make another phone call to my partner and advised him if he seen the helicopters and he reported yes he did.   When I exited my vehicle at approximately 12:15am, I noticed to object was gone, but when I looked off towards the north, northeast I noticed it again.   At approximately 12:20 am my partner got to his location and said he did not have a visual on the object.  I was at a higher elevation from my vantage point and did have a visual on the object.  The 3 what appeared to be helicopters went off over the Pinals and out of site.  At approximately 12:27am, what appeared to be a forth helicopter was flying in the area of the first sighting but then I noticed the object to the northeast was gone.  It was very interesting to me that after this object was spotted a group of aircraft (I believe was helicopters due to how they were moving) were spotted in the area looking for \"something\".   I have been in the fire service for 25 years, and have a pretty good head on my shoulders and I know what I saw that night.   My phone was at dispatch center charging and my company phone cannot take pictures due to the confidentiality of areas I work in.",

      "story": "I could not move at first. Occurred:  6/30/1952     21:00.       I was living at XXXX SW 51st Court, Miami, Fl. I was going to sleep at night and I was 8 years old.  As I was saying my prayers with my eyes closed, lying in bed I felt like someone was watching me outside of my bedroom window.  I opened my eyes and saw a light staring down at me from up in the air like a helicopter about 300 feet away. I felt like my thoughts were being probed.  I think they could feel I was scared and they mirrored back my feelings.  I hid under the covers on my bed and then I became like I was frozen stiff and unable to move. They took me out of my bed holding my wrists, were leading me down the hallway.  I screamed for my dad. Telepathically they told me that he couldn't hear me.  I think everyone on my block was like under ether or something.  I don\u2019t remember going up into the saucer. The saucer was round with a see through dome from the inside out, night or day. I could draw great pictures of UFO\u2019s in school.  My parents blew off my story after I said , \u201cI saw a saucer last night\u201d.  My mom said on the way to the kitchen, \u201cGee I thought I locked the door last night\u201d, it was open in the morning.  I can remember all conversation and think precisely when I get an adrenalin rush. As they flew me to the mother ship, I remember vividly sitting down in the middle of the ship with the dome window behind them and I was afraid to let them think that I could see them as they stared at me.  I pretended not being able to see them. There was one alien that wanted to Communicate, maybe the navigator, the other two were standing in back of him, and they just watched and never tried to communicate ever.  We went to a larger ship. I remembered the docking port.  How we docked and the dome part of the saucer had a bottom rim that fit into the docking port and became attached to the ship, and as I was going aboard getting on board I remember the mesh floor and a small box next to the bulkhead, and the round top of the saucer fitting into the hole under the mother ship had lifted up.  I remember how big the ship was inside because it appeared small and was large inside. He told me when the tests started and over and over telepathically that it all would be over soon so just wait a little bit longer. Most of the things that happened above I could not remember at first but was reminded by other things as I lived my rest of my life. I saw one recognizable abductee that was very familiar on TV years later and she was complaining about her experience of being used during the abduction. They let me see the space view of the Gulf of Mexico at night, with the city lights from New Orleans to Tampa.  I remember the color of light aboard the ship as the sun was coming up, They showed me a ray gun.  The end of it had a shape similar to a filament that hangs electric wires from telephone poles.  Because of their telepathy they can feel things that their body never feels through your experiences.  Maybe they try to get some of our features to benefit themselves. I was on their ship more than once, because of my scoop marks. I even saw a hooded figure that scarred me standing next to a cement slab.  They told me how many kids I would have. I saw a projection of my wife years before I got married. I believe aliens look a little oriental. They will step in to our world if they think we are going to destroy our world. It is like controlling the bad fish in a fish bowl from breaking the fish bowl. All that happened when I was 8 years old in the UFO flap of 1952.  The UFOs flew over President Truman\u2019s White House and were as were seen flying up the east coast as reported by Eastern Airlines pilots, on route to the north from Florida. When my parents moved houses in Miami they moved in back of Norman Beans house, a MUFON original board member.  Coincidence or not, you be the judge. When I get reminded of more I will add more.

      "story": "Orange Orbs After Thanksgiving dinner, my parents walked me out to my truck.  We were talking outside when we noticed an orange orb fly above us.  We stared at it because it looked like nothing we have ever seen before.  It flew from the north to the south until it disappeared into the night horizon.  We were puzzled because it definitely was not a helicopter, or a plane.   Immediately after it disappeared, and during our discussion of what it could be, another orange orb originated from the same place.  We watched the first one come from and it took the same exact flight route immediately above us.   For this orb I quickly reached for my cell phone and began snapping away pictures (I will follow up with an email including all pictures I took).   Again, as soon as the 2nd orb disappeared, the 3rd orange orb began its trip.  It also took the same route as the first two orbs and disappeared into the night's horizon.  I also took a few pictures of the 3rd orb.  My parents and I s! tayed for a few minutes outside searching the sky for more, but did not see any more. Curiously enough, the pictures do not all reflect what we saw with the naked eye.  Also note that some of the pictures I tried using the zoom feature.  And lastly, the orbs made absolutely no noise as they passed directly above us. The other two witnesses were my retired parents.  I happened to have my cat on a leash with us, but he did not see it nor did he act unusual. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to Miami 11/27/14 10:35 pm Event-- NO LONGER A UFO.

After about 15 seconds a ball of flame fell, arcing downwards from the body of the main fireball. I had my phone out and shot some video - not terribly distinguishable - the falling flame disappeared behind the buildings in our view towards the water.  The main flame faded out immediately and disappeared.  It did appear that there were lights in the same area and they turned 270 degrees and headed north, looking like a normal plane's lights....

I remember my parents weren't home that night. we would just hang out point lasers a cars.  But this night something caught out eyes in the sky. our apartment had 5 floors plus the roof. so we had a pretty good view of the shape of the object. I'd say it was t least a mile or two from eye distance.  It was disc shaped. we noticed it stayed in place for about 5-10 minutes then it started rotating in its spot very slowly. With all 3 different colors flashing around it. bright green, blue and red..  Oh and no sound! whatsoever it was as silent as can be! no way it could have been an airplane or helicopter. we were in awe and were saying \"wow this is a ufo!\"  I remember my friend saying he thought he was going to cry! we used to live very close to Miami international airport.  and this craft was hovering above some big trees in the area . It was kind of like a mini forest, which those trees have been cut down ever since. Well after the 10-15 minutes of it rotating on its spot it finally moved to the right and went in back of one of the tress and we never saw it again. I truly believe it was UFO not from this planet!   Also I'm sure other people driving around that area probably got a better glimpse of this object than we did.",

At first I would have disregarded it as a satellite or a plane however what caught my eye was the trail or perhaps tails attached to the object.

I will do my best to describe it but it is difficult without a physical drawing.   Behind the dot two curved lines making it look like a semicircle was forming behind the craft.

As I walked out from my porch, I looked up at the sky as there was a clear spot with huge stars.  I looked over to the East to look at the Moon, when one of the stars in that cluster to the west caught my eye, it started moving, silently.   I quickly looked back and was astounded to see that one of the huge stars on the perimeter of the little formation started moving north slowly, and deliberately, across the sky.  It was not twinkling or changing colors, just a huge ball of light that looked exactly like a star. I stood there in wonder and continued to watch it.  After a few minutes it got closer to what looked like a tiny star and they twinkled at each other as the big one passed the little one.  This was just astounding!  I continued to watch the big star travel across the sky until it disappeared behind a large, fluffy cloud. I wanted to go inside and get my husband, but I knew if I turned away it would be gone. I have seen UFO's before, and one time in 2009 we had a shared family sighting of a large triangle craft in Fort Lauderdale, but I have never reported anything before.

So I cross the bridges over the water, and I am looking at this very impressive summer sunsent, with very strange and massive clouds around it, and suddenly I see something out of place.  (time around 7:10/7:11 pm)  I see something shining in between the clouds (in the direction of the sunset), but with a shape that does not appear to be natural at all.  I could see the exhaust glowing on the left side of what appear to be a huge ufo, an under glowing too, and over it what appear to be like a city over it, picture when you see the top of a navy carrier, that\u2019s what it look like on the top of the huge ufo.  I was driving and over a bridge so I couldn\u2019t stop to see it without risking to be part of a car accident.   I pull out my phone, while driving, and tried to take a picture, but I could not get it. I did got the time which is enough giving the facts.  Now, before I get call crazy or whatever, I want to state clearly that the whole structure was not visible, the only parts visible where the ones I describe before, the exhaust on the left side and under and the shining of the sun on the top structure.  If this is actually a ufo, it was extremely big and most probably was inside the atmosphere because I guess the reflection effect is not the same if you are in space.  But I don\u2019t know, I am not a weather expert. I want to add, today was a very strange day weather wise.  It was full of clouds that looked like columns, it wasn\u2019t raining but the sky was full of electrical activity.  I am completely sure that if this was an UFO there is no way, no way, the radars would miss it, it was just to enormous.

I had already cleared the city, and was well on my way through the back country of the US 60 when the siting occurred.  It was roughly 20:15 and the sun was still setting to the west.  However, to the east, the sky was already dark.   As I came around a bend on the highway, I glanced towards a dark empty part of the sky.   The bearing of my sight was roughly 120 degrees SSE.  I noticed a light in the sky that appeared to have a reddish orange glow.  Upon further inspection, I noticed this light was more of an orb positioned just over the horizon, but close enough to tell that it was not a star in the sky.   The orb was so odd looking that I could not focus on anything but the light, only taking my eyes off it to glance back at the road.  Having a background in aviation communications I was quick to make the judgement that this was not an anti-collision light of any sort and not an aircraft light that I had seen in the past.  The glow was almost incandescent as opposed to having an LED appearance.  The orb did not waver at all.  It held its position, and that\u2019s what I found so odd about it.   About 15-20 seconds in, the orb shot out an additional orb to the east of it.  The second orb maintained the same position once it shot out from the first orb.  Both orbs now were the same exact size and luminosity.  If I were to guess they were about 100 feet away from each other in the sky.   It was also apparent that the second orb traveled from the first orb to its position because a slight tracer of light was visible; the second orb did not just appear.  It traveled from the first orb to its position.  At this point, there were two identical orbs in the sky and just as I thought that was crazy enough, a third orb shot out from the second orb.  Now 3 identical orbs maintained their positions in the sky.  They did not move or flicker.   Roughly 10-15 seconds after that, they all disappeared rather quick, almost as if they quickly! faded, but it was hard to tell.

      "story": "3 Star like crafts in New Years 2018 My husband and I went your to watch fireworks at midnight. Looking up at the sky we saw one light that looked like a star moving quickly.  In front of the moon and near the Big Dipper.  Then we noticed a star looking craft also moving across.  The game together moving around one another then a third craft came.  They were definitely moving and joined together to make contact.  They remained there for a long time and they got more distant because we could still see them but they were harder to see because they were farther alway.  Not a drone.  Too high and they looked just like stars.  One of the first sightings I\u2019ve had. We assume that they were observing earth during our celebration.  Maybe you will see some crafts tonight and I hope others spotted them.  They actually may still be up there if you look now near the Big Dipper and moon.",

While walking to my cousins house, returning from watching fireworks from the Belle Meade area of Biscayne Bay in Miami Florida. I was walking West on NE 72nd Street when I noticed a very bright red/orange light coming from the NW direction. The object from the best I could tell was far away across Biscayne Boulevard over another neighborhood. When it got directly in front of me, still far away it stopped and hovered in one spot for several seconds. I could not hear if it made any sound and it was still very, very bright red. I thought it was a helicopter but it made no noise and didn't have search lights. The light/s shut off on the object and it flew South in a straight line. I could still see it and tracked it for a few seconds before it was out of site. It looked gray and was oval/disc shaped. I told my wife what I was seeing right when the lights went out, so she nor any of the others in our group ! witnessed it. The entire event was took place in less than 30 seconds.",

      "story": "Hovering and moving object seen over South Beach, Miami I was at South Beach Miami at the time of the event around 830pm.  I was laying on my beach towel looking up at the sky when I saw an object moving in a strange way.  At first I thought it may be a plane because I was close to the airport, but it was not moving like a plane.  It would hover, and then slowly move in any direction, sometimes in a circular type way.  It was too far away to really tell the shape of the object.  At first glance you would think it was a bright star.  There was also a smaller and dimmer object near it that also appeared to be moving and hovering.   I watched them for two hours hoping I would catch it fly away into night sky or something to affirm my suspicion.  There were a couple times the object moved quite fast, but for a short distance.  A little after 1030pm I had to leave because the cops were shooing people off the beach (it closes at 10).  I started packing my things and I looked back up at the sky and the object was gone. I started walking toward the city and I saw the two objects moving toward the city as well at a fairly decent speed.  I continued to follow the objects until they stopped to continue hovering. I had to leave because my phone was almost dead.  I was able to catch a little video, but it is pretty bad quality.",

While I was looking through the paperwork my driver starts screening at me if he is seeing things, he asked me if I saw the same lights as he was.  I look up and sure enough there they are.  About 10 of them in perfect line formation equal distance apart.  I wasn\u2019t sure what was it we were looking at but I told him yes I sure do see them.  As soon as I said that these lights that were just hovering in the air rose about 20% straight up (all together) then they stopped, and then, they became instant circle like number 0 in the air. At this point maybe 40+ seconds have passed and I jumped out of the truck grabbed my phone and started recording.  I have 48 seconds of the footage of what we saw afterwards and would love to share it with you. Some people speculate drones or paratroopers but we checked and there were no paratroopers anywhere near and it\u2019s hard for me to believe it was drones as their moves define laws of physics.  I would love to share the video with you it\u2019s incredable and 100% original and what we saw.",

I can guess this because I live a few miles south and east of Miami International, there are planes landing and taking off all the time and I was able to get a plane at flying altitude as a comparison.  Using the Star Chart app I confirmed it was not Cassiopedia and no other visible stars were at this location.  Two lights.. One bright white with another just beside it slowing drifting due east..  Watched with my dad as they very very slowly moved east until they were gone.  Not very dramatic but I am certain they weren't planes..  Definitely not stars..  With all the light polution in Miami they were incredibly bright and any planets and stars would have definitely shown up on the star chart.",

My dog that night was freaking out and didn\u2019t want to go to the backyard she was like frozen and shaking like if she was afraid of something.  This happed 3 times within a few months and he got marking in his back in different places every single time, and similar events around the same time with the same memories of a very vivid nightmare all 3 times.  We reported all this events to a website called red markings phenomenon, wich promised someone would reach out to us.  I never ha! d anyone contact us, and the website doesn\u2019t seem to have anyone overlooking it anymore, even now other people are still reporting similar events.
