Sailing is pretty boring when there is no wind. i was reclining looking up into the sky and I saw a circle in the clouds. My first impression is that it looked like one of those big round plastic paper clips, round with a tongue coming down the center. It was at a very high altitude and obscured by high clouds. It was so faint that I thought it might be a glare on my granny sunglasses. I moved my head up and down and side to side. The object did not move. I raised the sunglasses and the object was not visible. I put the glasses back on and it was visible. It was very faint and line pattern was white in color. so the object was a white line on a blue sky background with white clouds all around. Very hard to see. I had some binoculars just out of arms reach and I was worried about losing the object. I took a chance and reached for the binoculars. I never saw it again. The object was perfectly round and symmetrical. It did not move, with my outstretched arm, it was about half the size of my thumb. At the altitude that it was, that would make it huge.  I will include a diagram of what it looked like, on Microsoft Visio. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "A silver polygon object with several satelight ships over downtown Los Angeles in the mid nintey's, stops and flys straight up. I don't have the exact date, it was some time ago.  I estimate it was the summer of 1995.  I was outside in my back yard in South Los Angeles CA.  Clear blue sky, no wind, early afternoon.  Something told me to look up.  I did and at an altitude of about 10,000 feet (estimated, it was just above the normal flight plan of landing LAX planes) headed east bound right over downtown was what appeared to be a weather balloon, silver in color.  This ballon was shaped like a 3 dimensional polygon, the sides were triangular so I gues it would be described as a dodecahedron.  I looked closer and saw several dark collered what looked like jet airplanes with curved back wingtips in hot pusuit of this weather balloon.  Just then a friend of mine walked up and wondered what I was looking at.  I showed him and he saw the same thing (a big releif!).  Just then the Balloon stopped in mid flight just east of downtown Los Angeles.  The \"jets\" that were in hot pursuit split off in formation and began circling the baloon (i.e. the first plane went let, second went right, third left and so on).  The Balloon stated to spin at about 10 rpm.  More and more \"jets\" began to appear and I counted maybe 20 of them at this point.  After holding in this position for about 2 minutes the baloon took off stright up at a rapid and controlled rate and the jets broke the circular formation and followed right behind the balloon in a straight line, straight up until I could no longer see them with the naked eye.  The speed was comprable to a space shuttle launch but there was no noise, no smoke or trails.  I heard no unusual sound and the only thing I noticed is this was taking place in the normal flight plan that planes land at LAX and during the entire time of the sighting no other air traffic was seen or heard.

      "story": "Three motionless black triangles above West LA. In the summer of 2000, I was driving with my then girlfriend late one afternoon westbound on Pico Blvd. just west of Sawtelle Blvd..  While stopped at a traffic light, she pointed to something she saw in the sky which was almost directly over us. I had to lean forward to be able to see up through the windshield to observe 3 identical black triangular objects. I observed them for less than 30 seconds.  The objects were motionless and we could not hear any noise from the objects. There were no markings, lights or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.), just a solid black object. the objects were in a loose triangle formation separated from each other by a distance of approximately 5 times their individual width. What struck me most was their stillness and almost silhouette-like appearance. My impression is that the objects were the size of private jets or fighter planes. They were significantly higher in altitude that the normal Santa Monica airport traffic that occurs regularly in that area, enough so that a closed fist at arms length could have covered two of the objects (were they spaced tip to tip). While observing them, I moved my head to change my viewing angle so as to verify that this was not caused by debris on the widshield or reflections. These were definitely airborne objects. Once the traffic light changed to green, I resumed driving, but was unable to see the objects again since they were nearly directly overhead. Once we had driven a few blocks so that the objects should have been easier to view from a shallower angle, the sky was empty where thay had been.

The windows were half open and pushed out like shutters, perpendicular to the building, so I could see reflections in the window panes.  I was facing the mirror,  East, when I noticed a light out of the corner of my right eye.  My mind computed that I was seeing the moon reflected in the window, so I turned to check out the moon.  Instead I saw two lights in the distance, one heading West, the other heading East.  It took my mind a couple of seconds to understand what I was seeing.  I remember clearly thinking that I was seeing an airplane heading West on its descent to LAX, and also seeing it's reflection in the window, because they were heading right for each other.  But a second later I realized I wasn't, that I was watching two real, separate lights heading towards each other, one from the West, the other from the East.  My heart immediately started racing as it dawned on me that I might be witnessing an in air collision.  But after a few tense seconds the lights passed each other and I was relieved.  Until the light heading East stopped, held its position for a second, and flew away arcing due South.  It was completely gone in under two seconds.

My intention was to take the video to the police station and file a complaint about them frequently using our community to practice their loud flight patterns early in the morning.  When out the right side of my peripheral vision I saw this object hovering in the sky.   I watched it as it moved into view of my camera, then towards the helicopter, before it sped away at what looked like lightning speeds.  Now, I know some skeptics are going to say, \"It could have been a laser light source,\" but that helicopter was at least a mile away from my house at the furthest part of its circular pattern.  What kind of laser light would I be able to see from standing on my porch approximately a mile or so away?  Who would have such a powerful mechanism to shine into the sky where it would be visible to others for miles?  Look how that object moves.  It is definitely an unexplained flying object hovering over South Los Angeles.  Hell, for all I know, that might be why that helicopter was in the air.

On approach at approximately 2,000 feet bearing east toward downtown, approximately 1-2 minutes before right turn into final.   Observed a small, metallic sphere traveling in the opposite direction (west) at a very high rate of speed.  Distance, speed and size of craft not possible in the very short duration of observation.  Object appeared reflective.  Sighting was not discussed with any other crew members or passengers. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Peter I did not mention it to others on the aircraft and the date is accurate within a week or so.  I was actually familiar with the flight crew, as I take this fight many times a month but the cockpit door was closed as we disembarked so the opportunity didn\u2019t exist to discuss.     I don\u2019t want to get into the details of what I do for a living but I fly a lot, sometimes many times a week.  I\u2019m very familiar with most types of aircraft, both civilian and military (and I\u2019ve flow on over 25 types personally).  I\u2019ve seen similar objects on two separate occasions over the last 15-20 years.  Both were metallic spheres, one was a metallic green and the other more red and they seemed to have a slight glow\u2026 and both, I recall, seemed disturbingly close to the aircraft.  Those, if I recall correctly, happened over the mid-west but it was many years ago.  I believe one was near DFW. The recent sighting was the first I\u2019ve had in at least a decade.  The object just seemed to be metallic with no coloration.  But it was an extremely brief sighting. As I mentioned, the disturbing part to me is that these objects are flying, at high speed, well within safe commercial separation.  It\u2019s hard to determine their actual size but maybe something akin to Sputnik.  They seem to have no visible means propulsion or ability to stay aloft (wing surface, stabilizers, etc) nor any other surface breaks, antenna, etc. I\u2019ve always been reluctant to discuss but now that I\u2019m on number three I feel compelled to figure it out.  I brought it up only once prior to a 777 pilot deadheading in a seat next to me but he wasn\u2019t very eager to continue the line of conversation.  If they\u2019re government controlled it\u2019s amazing that such technology exists but, at the same time, seemingly dangerous practice.  Especially over such busy airspace as the Los Angeles Basin.

The object hovered for about ten to fifteen seconds before rapidly flew forward and out of sight in less than a second.   I stopped at the first gas station and called the Sheriff's office to report the sighting.  All that was said to me was that they had several calls already, and that my sighting would be noted.

Then, a few seconds later, two more of these objects came cruising slowly to where the first one was apparently waiting because a few seconds later, the first one suddenly shot away northward in a zigzagging motion that took two or three really quick direction changes. Then it would come to a dead, sudden stop, and just sit there while the two following came slowly over to where it was, but in a straight line.

Every one of my neighbors \u2013 approximately 200 people \u2013  stood out on the street looking skyward as the disk shaped craft hovered vertically south of my house.  The disk had a intense mirrorlike reflective top half and dense black appearance on the bottom half.  The unidentified craft hovered motionless here for two hours in broad daylight.  I got a excellent look at the disk with 9x binoculars.  Every now and then, a brilliant ruby red light would shoot down to the earth from the craft as if it was aimed a few blocks from me.  During the two hour period, not one car drove past my location, either on Eagle Rock Blvd. or any side street. At one point, I could see a small window open in the side of the craft.  The image was distant, but I could see something move inside the disk before the window seamlessly closed.  The craft hovered here until 11am and then began to slowly drift south.  After a few minutes the unidentified disk tilted on its axis, at a forty-five degree angle, and then disappeared into a point of light. The disk was seen at least ten blocks in every direction which means over 2000 people saw this strange unidentified object.

      "story": "bright multi-colored lights emanate from disc flying/hovering silently approx 500 ft in the air I was visiting Gautier, MS for the summer in the late 70's and I remember there was a lot of talk in the media about a comet (or meteor) that would be visible early one morning between 2-3am. Being a curious person I set my clock to wake up so I could witness this celestial event. I went outside that morning and within a few minutes I did see some heavenly body streak across the sky. Just before I was about to go back inside to bed, I saw something else that I've never seen the likes of before or since. In the not too distant night sky I saw a disc shaped object floating slowly towards me. It was very brightly colored (the lights alternated red, blue, green and orange in a circular pattern around the object). I was transfixed by this sight as it inched towards our house. Over the next twenty minutes it floated closer and closer to the yard where I was standing. After about ten minutes of observation it was clear to me that this object was approaching and would soon be directly over head. I would estimate the disc at about 400-500ft in diameter and flying about 500-750ft in the air. There were times when it appeared to come to a dead stop and simply hover, then begin floating slowly closer. The flickering alternating colorful lights were the most striking thing about it and I remember wondering what government technology could produce such an object. At about the 20 minute mark in the sighting, the object was nearly directly over my head and I remember a strong fear coming over me. I was afraid of being spotted by this craft and went back inside the house. From various windows inside I continued to watch the object as it flew over the front of the house and I ended up in my bedroom watching it pass over the back yard. The object never made a sound. There were a bunch of trees behind the house a few hundred yards away; once the object glided over those trees it appeared to descend further. I watched it hover just above those trees for another 10 minutes or so before it ascended and quickly! flew ou t of sight. No airplane, weather balloon, or helicopter that I know of could account for that sighting. I will never forget what I saw that night and I have come to believe that others have seen the same thing as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

When driving home from work in West Hollywood, I witnessed a small round object, that looked to be either a very dark red or black. I was driving north on La Cienega at around Wilshire.  Two helicopters patrolled the area, and 1 plane descended slightly in it's flight path, possibly to avoid the object.  After remaining stationary for just about 30 seconds, it began to move again, towards downtown (to my right at the time).  While driving, I lost sight of the object behind trees and buildings.  Approximately 20 minutes later, at about 4:45PM, I was heading into downtown LA towards the central library.  I was just exiting the 10 West onto the 110 North.  As I came around the curve, I saw the object again, exactly as before, in the skies above the city to the north, northeast of route 110 (a little ahead and to the left of the highway from my perspective.  I looked around at other vehicles and nobody seemed to notice it.  Behind me in a white/cream colored volkswagen station wagon, were a couple in their late 60's, early 70's.  They saw the object also, but exited at 9th St.  I continued on the 110 to the 4th street exit, and as I did so the object came much nearer to the roadway.  It was very large, massive is the word that I kept thinking.  The closer it got to me, it looked less and less round, and I could identify individual colors, including red and black.  The object was a structure, for certain, and was vaguely cube shaped.  There appeared to be some sort of boom, or large metal pole hanging down below the craft.  It did not look aerodynamic at all.  It kept a solid form, and did not waver, heading in a straight line.  It was was too big and way too stable to have been balloons blowing in the wind.  It floated overhead, and I lost sight of it as I took the 4th street exit.  I was back on the 110 heading south again 20 minutes later, and did not see the craft in the sky.",

As we passed through the area where I-5 intersects Highway 134, we both observed a very large elongated object hovering just east of that intersection, which from our vantage point would be to our left. It seemed to be no more than \u00bd mile from us and no more than 2 thousand feet in altitude (my estimate). The object was dull, dark grey in color, no windows. Our initial thought was that we were looking at a blimp, except for the fact that it was 2 to 3 times the length of some of the commercial blimps we normally see. The object was closer in size to WWII-era zeppelins The object we saw had no markings, no tail fins, and no underbelly cab. My driving speed at the time went with the flow of traffic, which I estimate to have been approximately 65-70 mph. Traffic was brisk, yet there were plenty of vehicles on the road. We both observed the object for maybe 8-10 seconds before a line of roadside trees momentarily blocked our view of the object. Our view of the object was obstructed at the most for 3 seconds before we passed the trees. Upon passing said trees, we realized the object was gone from where we had been observing it, and instead we noticed a small circular object far in the distance, now seemingly many miles east of our location, as it appeared to be very close to the adjacent San Gabriel Mtns.",

      "story": "Oval-shaped, metallic object w/ 2 bright lights pointing down spotted over Downtown LA; disappeared in 1 second. I was on the Golden State Freeway (I-5) in Los Angeles, CA heading northbound at approximately 1:40 a.m. on Saturday, 03 May 2008.  The temperature was 59 degrees Fahrenheit; clear skies; 58% humidity; visibility 10 miles (weather.com).  At the 101/I-5 junction in Downtown Los Angeles, I noticed a bright light near the Downtown LA skyline.  As I connected to the 101 freeway junction heading toward the light, I noticed that the light was in fact two (2) lights pointing down.  At first, I believed it to be a police helicopter; however, it appeared to be \u201clocked\u201d in the same spot, too steady to be hovering.  The almost-golden colored lights were large and close together; reminiscent of heating lights used to keep food warm at a buffet restaurant.  Noticing that there were no vehicles behind me nor ahead of me, I proceeded to slow down to 30 miles per hour (I was initially traveling at 65 mph); at which point I was observing the object above my vehicle slightly to the left, allowing me to see it without the roof of my vehicle obstructing my view.  The object appeared to be at about 700-800 feet in mid-air.  The shape of the object as viewed from directly underneath resembled the shape of a human eye; almost that of a football.  The lights were pointing down and were definitely not police helicopter lights (of which there is only one per craft; usually unstable and blue-white/halogen type).  Combined, the two lights took up an estimated 70% of the shape in which they were contained.  The object did not produce any visual/audible means of propulsion.  Its surface did not display any flashing lights, such as those of a police helicopter (flashing blue and red strobes on the sides) or any conventional aircraft.  The surface was dark-metallic.  Thin, fine, vertical and horizontal could barely be seen across its dark surface.  The top or \u201cside\u201d of the object was not visible, since it was viewed from underneath.  The area in which it was hovering in is assumed to be restricted airspace for airplanes; both private and commercial due to its proximity to the skyscrapers of the downtown district (less than a mile).  The nearest airport, Los Angeles International is approximately 15 miles southeast of Downtown LA.  Commercial and private airplane routes approaching the Los Angeles Metropolitan area head westbound almost directly above the 105 Freeway, which connects North Orange County/South Los Angeles County to LA International Airport.  This busy and well-known airplane route is approximately 10 miles south of Downtown LA.  It is also viewable 24 hours a day.  Goodyear blimps are known to fly in the area since Dodger Stadium is nearby; however, blimps are not known to display large, exceedingly bright lights.  The object observed was definitely not a blimp; it did not glide or appear to exhibit slight movement.  Dodger Stadium was not hosting any events that evening.  After reviewing a map of the area, I estimate the object\u2019s position to have been directly above Santa Fe Avenue & 7th Street (near the 7th Street bridge over the LA River) in Downtown LA.  As I was observing the object from my vehicle (window down, traveling at 30 mph); I glanced ahead quickly to make sure my vehicle was on track before I glanced back to observe the object again.  This went on for about 45 seconds.  As I glanced at the road quickly (about 1 second), I looked back up and the object was gone.  The area of sight in which I had the object in was large enough for me to track a helicopter or an airplane even at high speeds.  As I circled the Downtown LA area via the 101 junction ramp (first northbound, then northwest bound); I scanned the area for the object; however, it was no longer present.

      "story": "Floating large rectangle near Highland Park/Pasadena CA I was in my car traveling North on Figueroa St. in Highland Park, Los Angeles. I will have to return to see what the cross street was, but I had passed 60th St. It was about 4PM, perhaps a little after. Looking through my windshield, on the right side of the street, I could see the neighborhood buildings and beyond them, the hills South of Pasadena dotted with houses, across the LA River, not very far away at all.  In between, I spotted a rectangular object in the air. It was a flat gray. I could tell that it was slowly moving southward, perhaps above the river, which winds with the 110 freeway but more likely, above the hills.  I\u2019ll state right now that I know it wasn\u2019t a billboard, although it was positioned in a manner a billboard would be (long side down) and was at least the size of a billboard. The difference being this object was floating and moving through mid air.  I\u2019ll also state that it wasn\u2019t a blimp and I had already seen the Goodyear blimp earlier in the day, around the Pasadena area, since tomorrow is the Rose Bowl Parade. That was my first thought, that this was a promo for the Bowl and a plane was towing it, even though a plane at that low an altitude in that area would be a freak flight plan.  My \u201cmission\u201d then became to see this thing and the plane that might be towing it together, but I\u2019d have to see it in enough open space as I was getting my view blocked by buildings and trees as I drove. The next chance revealed the rectangle still moving with no plane to be seen anywhere. Now I thought it might be a balloon and I tried to get a good look at it, replacing my sunglasses with my glasses.  There seemed to be a texture to it like a chain-link fence pattern. Also there seemed to be 3 segments to it with 2 vertical lines from top to bottom. So it looked like left side, middle, right side, all about equal width. There may have been a circular shape in the middle one. No sound from it that I could hear. No lights or glows.  It still continued to move behind things that blocked my view so I tried again to get a better view and was frustrated by slow moving traffic. I\u2019ll state it was moving unlike a loose balloon might. It was heading in an edge-first, sideways manner, as if the bottom edge was on a track. I could also tell by the edge it was not very \u201cthick\u201d, that is I wasn\u2019t looking at one end of a house-like frame. It was much more flattened like a billboard.  It occurred to me to get to a spot where I could try to photograph it with my cell phone. I took out my phone and prepared it, still trying to keep the shape in sight. I approached an intersection and saw it again. This time it seemed to be picking up speed as if going around a curve and I stuck my arm out the window of my car and tried to snap a picture above the roof of my car.  At the intersection I realized I could go down the street toward the freeway and at that point, my view would be unblocked. I made the turn and raced down passed the cross streets, hopefully on an intercept course, as that was the very direction it was headed. It took anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds to get there without seeing the rectangle (blocked by neighborhood houses).  When I reached the end of the street with its open view of everywhere around, hoping to see a larger version of the rectangle or maybe even some explanation, it was totally gone from view. I looked in every direction. Nothing but everything as it usually is in broad daylight.  Possibly, I thought, it could have turned and descended on the other side of the hill ridge (it seemed to be low enough). Or, if it had simply dropped straight down, the trees would immediately block it from sight.  I stopped my car and then inched it along each block. Finally, I gave up and looked at the camera photo. The shot doesn\u2019t show it as it may have been pointed away slightly and I tried a vertical shot (done again I\u2019d have held it sideways or even chosen video capture and turned it to get the best coverage). The shot is oddly over exposed but it may have been the time of day.  I also immediately turned down the way I had come up Figueroa and retraced the road from the last 5 minutes, looking for any billboards I could have mistaken for it, etc. I saw nothing like it.  If I hear of any explanation of it, fine. I just would like to know what it was. I won\u2019t believe it if someone says it was pulled by something\u2026there wasn\u2019t anything in front or above. Also, anything loose that size near a highway and homes is hazardous.  I'll try to send along some illustrations.",

I was out on my balacony watching two low flying planes for a couple minutes when I noticed a white/reflected object high up in the sky over the two planes. I am not good at estimating distances, however it was a very clear and hot day and the object seemed to be higher up than even the 747's that where landing and taking off from LAX. I watched the object dart around once in a while and go left to right faster than the planes flying into the airport. As the object was at a rest and hovering still another object came from what seemed like nowhere and started circling the other. The two objects were the same size and began to fly what looked like over the two planes only the objects were a lot higher up. This lasted a while and one object would disappear and come back. At this time I called my boyfriend out and after a few minutes of trying to show him where to look he finally saw the object. I told him to keep watching because I just knew the other object would come back out again and start doing what looked like playing with the other object. And it did! It came up right next to the first object and then dropped way down and they both stayed at a hover for a few minutes. My boyfriend had never seen anything like this before that he couldn't explain, and this has been the 5th sighting for me. It felt good to have him see these things because you start to wonder if you are imagining it after a while. He tracked one and I would track the other as they would appear and disappear until minutes later we lost sight on them both. What a feeling came over me! I felt so calm and relaxed yet really excited to be able to see those objects for such a long period of time!",

I do not recollect seeing any color but remember that the portion I did see looked darker than the rest. There was a shimmery effect over most of the craft. It looked similar to the creature in the movie Predator. Could that have been an effect of \"cloaking\"?  I remember thinking the craft was round even though I could not see all of it.

One of the pieces was flaming and going to the ground and looked so close you were almost expecting to see some sort of impact secondary explosion of some sort.  The rest of the pieces almost seemed to disappear before going below the telephone lines and houses across the street and out of view. My son spotted this on 1-28-08 in the evening sky almost dark at 6:00 to 6:15 PM.  He ran inside telling me to look at these huge strange lights in the sky so I slipped my shoes on and immediately went out to see it and called my wife out to see it and we were all stunned.  The event lasted for approximately 4 or 5 minutes. We immediately turned on the news and flipped through the local channels looking for something but nothing on the news.  We turned on the news radio expecting to hear something but there was nothing.  I called 911 and reported it to the local police who said they had 1 call preceding mine and that 2 of their officers were on the radio reporting having seen the same thing.  We wanted to make sure it was not the Shuttle but looked up on line and it appears the shuttle is still on earth. We searched all local and other news on the web and found nothing.  Continued to watch our news and nothing but reports of the dead spy satellite that was due to crash into earth in the next month.  That story broke exactly 2 hours before we saw this.  The next day nothing in the news or the papers nothing on the web.  This seems odd to me. I am guessing it was a satellite breaking up and maybe these were large solar panels but they must have been huge.  I am not sure if anyone reading this can estimate size and distance but they appeared to be about an inch or so long in a photograph when entering the atmosphere above telephone lines across the street from my house so looking up about 50 feet in the south west sky.   I estimate they must have been much larger than a jumbo jet. They were so large all I could think of was the international space station having some problem.  Please if there is any news about this please let me know. Thank you.",

I had almost forgotten about it so when I started taking pictures the earths shadow had already covered most of the moon. This was around 7:35 my first few shots were handheld but I decided that the tripod would be a good idea. I took many pictures tracking the moon as it moved to the right across the sky. I stopped taking pictures around 20:10 because clouds were starting to move in. I never saw anything out of the ordinary while I was taking the pictures. After I downloaded the images I noticed a rainbow colored object in the lower left hand corner. Out of the 34 pictures I took it\u2019s in almost every one. Even the shot where I made the mistake of using a flash. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a light refraction. There is clearly a saucer shaped object with a full spectrum of colored lights wrapped around it. You can clearly see that the colored light wraps around the object. You can see how the light glows out into space kind of like a flashlight beam. My only guess as to why I didn\u2019t see it is that the light must pulse at a rate that makes the object invisible to the naked eye. Kind of like when you take a picture of an older TV & see line in the picture that you can\u2019t see when you\u2019re actually watching the TV.

He had binoculars, and when I looked through them I could see what looked like a metalic object that was moving slightly, but hovering at around 1000 feet. It looked like a metal tube at one point, but then appeared to change orientation and at that point it looked like a disk shape with lights around the perimiter. The lights appeared to flash. Then the objust appeared to rotate and lights were shooting out from the midline of the object where they had been in a rotational pattern before. The object hovered there for about 20 minutes, staying just below the cloud level before we lost sight of it.  We got pictures and will have those tomorrow.

I see in the sky these odd-shaped red lights that made me think \"what is that?\"   I watched it for about 5-10 seconds before it went out of view of my window and unfortunately I don't have other windows with a good view and I even went outside but couldn't see in that direction.  It was going in a southwest direction.   I see A LOT of planes out my window as a lot come into Santa Monica airport, and I see others traveling to/from LAX.  This was going in the direction of LAX so hopefully some other people saw it.   i'm not saying it was an alien space craft, just unlike anything I've ever seen out my window.  It had maybe 6-8 small red blinking lights that were widespread - maybe the lenght of 5-6 airplanes that I usually see out the window.   I'm just now thinking maybe it was a blimp, although it seemed to be moving faster than blimps move, but about same speed to a bit faster than a 747 type plane.   That's all I can really think to describe what I saw.  It was quick, but thought I'd share and see if anyone else saw it or has an explanation.   Didn't have time or equipment to take a pic/video.   There were definitely other planes nearby in the sky so pilots had to have seen it.",

It got so bright I closed my eyes and it hit the floor.  Power on that street shut down (and just that street).  The floor shook and I remember hearing what sounded like an electrical voltage sound.  Besides Paramount Pictures, the area around me is mostly residential, including the section of Melrose that the light hit.  I saw several people walk outside to see what it was.  I also noticed that some cars stopped dead as if they ran out of power. About 2 minutes later I saw the LAPD arrive but they had no sirens on... just lights and they were don't anything.  The cop cars (3 of them) just stopped in the middle of the street and the police officers just stood on the street outside the main entrance of Paramount looking at eachother.  Cars continued to drive up and down the street.  My bus arrived about 5 minutes later and I saw the cops and leaving and several black cars showing up.  I also heard some kind of aircraft in the sky.  Once before I had seen a black helicopter in the sky that only let off a humming noise instead of the usual noise helicopters make.  Although I looked around I didn't see anything. When I got home (Wilshire & Western) I told my roomate that something wierd had happened and told him of what came out of the sky and he said he saw the same thing from outside our building.  He said he was texting someone from inside his truck and noticed lights.  He specifically recalled seeing 3 beams of light and seeing green.  He blow it off as electrical transformers blowing up (LA had a Santa Ana winds kicking up that day).  But from my angle and view, no electrical transformer could ever be has high as I saw those lights. Something we both noticed a short time later were hazmat trucks driving towards Paramount. Nothing on the news reported what I saw.  When I looked on the Craigslist, there was no talk to mention of what we saw.  And I know there were other witnesses because not only did I see people walk out of the restuarants and homes, but because it was in the middle of Los Angeles. The next day local news still had not reported anything, neither had the LA Times or yahoo. Today I found a story that on Sunday in Singapore people reported the exact same thing I saw.  3 beams of light or fire, most mentioned they saw green.  And the wierdest and scariest part that my roomate pointed out that I failed to look at, the Singapore newspaper story stated it happened at 7:40pm Sunday (they're a day behind Pacific time). I can't find any more information though.  Anyone else notice it?  Or can find a news report about it??",

      "story": "Brief sighting of a group of black triangles that suddenly disappeared. Appearance / Description of Object(s):  Black triangular objects with no markings, lights, reflections or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.).  Size of Object(s):  At arms length, the objects appeared to be less than 2 inches across. The actual size appeared close to that of a private or fighter jet. The objects appeared to be equilateral triangles with less than 100 feet per side.  Distance to Object(s) & Altitude :  Directly overhead. My guess would be around 7500 feet in altitude.  Description of Area / Surroundings :  West Los Angeles (urban) just west of the intersection of Pico & Sawtelle Blvds close to Santa Monica airport.  Full Description & Details :  In the summer of 2000, I was driving with my then girlfriend late one afternoon before sunset westbound on Pico Blvd. just west of Sawtelle Blvd.. While stopped at a traffic light, she pointed to something she saw in the sky which was almost directly over us. I had to lean forward to be able to see up through the windshield to observe 3 identical black triangular objects. I observed them for less than 30 seconds. The objects were motionless and we could not hear any noise from the objects. There were no markings, lights, reflections or familiar aircraft features (stabilizers, etc.), just a solid black object. The objects were in a loose triangle formation separated from each other by a distance of approximately 5 times their individual width. What struck me most was their stillness and almost silhouette-like appearance.  My impression is that the objects were the size of private jets or fighter planes. They were significantly higher in altitude that the normal Santa Monica airport traffic that occurs regularly in that area, enough so that a closed fist at arms length could have covered two of the objects (were they spaced tip to tip).  While observing them, I moved my head to change my viewing angle so as to verify that this was not caused by debris on the windshield or reflections. These were definitely airborne objects.  Once the traffic light changed to green, I resumed driving, but was unable to see the objects again since they were nearly directly overhead. Once we had driven a few blocks so that the objects should have been easier to view from a shallower angle, the sky was empty where they had been.  Given the shape of the craft, their hovering behavior and sudden apparent disappearance, I assume that these were solid objects under some sort of control, though not any type that I am familiar with nor aware of.  Witness Background:  At the time, I was working in the entertainment industry as an artist for an internet animation studio. I have a bachelor's degree in Fine Art and am currently self-employed as an illustrator.  Views on UFOs, before and after sighting:  I have a strong interest in UFOs, both before and after my sighting. I have read several books on the subject and seen several documentaries, as well as listened to the Coast to Coast, the Paracast and other paranormal-related radio programs. I have found that this interest and the knowledge I have acquired has made me more of a skeptical observer than I was before since I am more aware of the conventional sighting explanations.  Other Comments :  My sighting is consistent with other \"Black Triangle\" sightings listed here and on other UFO sites.

I saw no strobe lights, or wing lights, nor was there a sound. I figure that the object may have been around 1000 feet or so in altitude. At that altitude sound would have been detectable. The interesting thing about this was the glow around the light --- and I must say, it was very bright. When the object got just about overhead I ran down to the entryway of the building and watched it for a few seconds more. This took about 10 seconds. When the building got in the way again, I ran to the parking lot to the South side of the building to watch it until it disappeared into the high haze in the Southeast.",

Clear, light blue skies, well lit still by sun, half-full moon in the sky over Hollywood / Los Angeles area.  My brother and I were sitting outside enjoying the evening.  Told him to check out the star and moon (which were right next to each other, the star was JUST outside the crescent, as if cradled) and he said \"that can't be a star, it must be a planet, it's so light out.\"  Then it started moving, we said, \"Oh, it's a plane\".  But then when it came to a complete halt, we said, \"um.  ok.  do helicopters fly that high?\".  Then we noticed another one going perpindicular, which seemed to appear out of nowhere (our eyes were PRETTY focused on the clear section of sky in our view).  Then we called our friends over who were setting up a tent in the backyard and we all watched for a while.  We then saw three more of them appear and fly in a standard V formation and then re-form at LIGHTNING speed (very very high up) into a few other odd formations and then dissapear.  These thing came into and out of view in a split second.  My friend checked them out with his binocolurs and said it appeared \"round\" with lights front and back.  Ok, i know, sounds like classic b.s.    Well, if they're planes, what in the flying hell are they doing such incredible stunts right over central Los Angeles for?    I tried to reach the FAA and Homeland Security at LAX and got an answering machine!  Lovely!  I spoke with someone (in the flurry of numbers i called) at a local airforce command station who said they had no flying going on in the area at the moment and ref'd me here!  Nice one guys.  Gathering enemy threat in the skies? Cool, ref it over to UFOCentral! Jesus.  Not putting this site down, it's just that i'd expect a little more from their response, let alone the FAA and Homeland Security.  After around 25 minutes more they were all gone.  They did not fly off north or south or east or west, they just vanished. I took pics but no luck, took video and got some of it - you can check it out here, but if i get too many downloads, i'll have to cut it.  I hope that someone will archive it and post it elsewhere if it's of use.  When you watch the clip, at 4 seconds into it you'll see a white dot in the top left quarter of the screen (you'll see the unfocused power lines running diagonally, follow the wires to find the white dot).  You'll see it, over the span of one second of film, it moves to the left across the power lines farther left and upwards.  (I'm not saying the craft moved that fast, it was my camera motion that moved quickly).  Anyway, admittadly, the film proves nada, only that we thought we were seeing some very very wacky stuff that none of us (4 of us in our thirties and 2 children) can explain.

Then it sprayed some kind of cloud like material (white and streaky, like a rain shower or fireworks, except it looked like cloud material) after that the brightness disappeared but the object was still present, looking like a lightly glowing orb. It continued on and away from us, eventually disappearing over the horizon, in a southward direction.",

The night before an in house officer was shot and killed by intruders.  We were stting in a prefab guard house about 15 ft by 15ft and I turned off the lights so we could see if anyone would come over the outside walls. The unarmed officer sat diagonaly from me in the shack and neither of us could see each other's faces. (we were both caucasions).   Suddenly the guard shack filled up with a translucent blue light and at that point I could see the other man's face.   We were both amazed.  I looked up at the florescent lights and they were off for sure.  I looked outside thru the windows and could see no source of the blue light. After the light was gone I called the LAPD, asking if anyone hit a power pole in the area that could cause such a light to happen.  They stated no.   I added this incident to the nightly report and we continued the shift.  I have no idea how this light came to be.  It lasted about 15 or 20 seconds or so.   I did however find that my ability to play the electronic keyboard was greatly enhanced and later i was tested for IQ due to an accident in an armored truck when my attorney filed a law tort.  My IQ had increased from 117 (measured in the USMC in 1959) to 160.  To this date I can not figure out what that light was.  I did not see anything in the sky due to being inside the shack.  My hand was definitely on my .38 revolver from the time of the light to minutes afterward!!!!   Since I am retired now I dont care what anyone thinks.

My friend and I were talking face to face and a bright light lit up in the sky behind him.  I glanced over to see what it was and I saw an object in the sky about 2-3 inches wide from where I was standing... not too sure how far it actually was though.  If I had to guess I would say possibly 20 miles north and lower then an airplane flying in the sky.  It had a few VERY intense lights underneath it that I seemed to have felt the heat from... it was very faint, not enough for my friend to feel it, but I completely felt it get slightly warmer.  The same warm feeling as if someone were to turn an intense spotlight on you.  The UFO was traveling extremely smoothly at a very slight angle (maybe 15 degrees or so) up toward the sky for about 3 or 4 seconds, then all of the lights turned off, my eyes adjusted from the intense lights going off, and the ob! ject was completely gone. My friend saw my expression change in my face and turned around to see what I was looking at, but when he turned around he only turned enough to see into the apartment next to us.  He thought I was looking at something in the apartment so he didn't turn around all the way enough to see the craft.  He told me that the expression I made was so genuinely fearful that it freaked him out... although after it passed I thought it was awesome!  - Dan",

      "story": "Bright white football shaped object, turned neon green and shot off horizontally   While attending a family Thanksgiving in Los Angeles, CA, our family had booked several rooms at the Four Seasons Hotel on Doheny Blvd, near Beverly Hills. Our room was on the 5th floor. Since our room was in the middle of the hotel it became the meeting place for everyone. The first morning we were there, which was November 26 at about 9 am the room began to shake ever so slightly. We turned on the TV to find that there was a 5.4 earthquake.  We were delighted to have a great story to tell when we got home back to Texas. What happened next, paled in comparison to the earthquake. The last night we were there, Saturday November 28, 1992, we ate out and those of us staying at the hotel came back to pack for Sunday\u2019s departure back to our respective homes across the country.  My husband and children went to sleep around 9:30. My two nephews who had other rooms at the same hotel, came to our room to visit.  The room was sort of a one bedroom suite with a separate living area that had a balcony. We went to the balcony at 10:30, I remember because I checked the time and checked on my family who were all asleep. I was on the balcony with my two nephews ( aged 24 and 26) we could see the layout of the area below which was like a courtyard where people were sitting at tables and walking around. We chatted and enjoyed people watching as well. All of a sudden, as if someone on the roof had thrown it, I saw what appeared to be a football shaped object bright white light come down in an arc (it did not fall straight down, it arched from the roof to in front of us) to eye level where it seemed to hover in front of us. I happened to be looking up at the sky or roof when it first appeared so I saw it from the get go. I remember one nephew saying, \"What is that?\"  The light or whatever it was hovered in front of us for what seemed to be a few seconds then took off like a bullet horizontally and as it did so, it changed color from bright white light to a neon green, with the green advancing from the front to the rear of the object as it changed color, it disappeared into the darkness. Suddenly, we realized it was 3:00 AM, we were sort of surprised that the time flew by, they left to their rooms and we all went right to sleep. The next morning, we gathered our things said our goodbyes and headed to the airport. While on the plane to Dallas, I suddenly remembered and told my husband, \"We saw a UFO or something.\"  He was quite amazed and had me tell him the whole story.  He found it significant that neither of the nephews had mentioned it, and I had not remembered it when we were all together that morning. My eyes started bothering me beginning that day on the plane ride home. I was seeing spots in front of my eyes like you see after flash photography. I assumed it would go away. By Monday, I was trying to get in touch with my nephews to see what or if they were experiencing something. The younger of the two told his mother who told me that in the night of the sighting, he had a bad nightmare that something had him tied down to a table and was trying to hurt him  By Thursday of the same week, my eyes were somewhat better, but the spots were still there. So, I went to the eye Dr. He checked and said that I had damage similar to an arc welders burn at the back part of the inside of my eye. He asked if I had been near anyone while they were welding. I told him no, not at all. He said the spots would go away in a few more days and they eventually did. When I was finally able to speak to my nephews about our experience, neither really wanted to discuss it other than to say it was the strangest thing they\u2019d ever seen.  Neither of them could understand why it was 10:30 then 3:00 and why time flew by, furthermore none of us could understand why we all seemed to forget about it completely until I remembered. The nephew that had the nighmare said he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, so I dropped it. Page 2 UFO Experience cont\u2019d. I became obsessed with this experience.  Since the Internet was not available at the time, I went to the Dallas Public Library. I asked the Librarian how to report a UFO. She turned to a reference book, and gave me two names.  The first of which was in Phoenix, AZ. To this day, I cannot remember the man\u2019s name. I called him and he took down the incident.  He may have had me make a drawing and mail it or fax it to him. He had the oddest monotone voice, very deep but without emotion or inflection.  He assured me he would look into it.  A few weeks later, he called me and told me that he went to the Four Seasons, he actually stayed in our room (back then I knew the room number and gave it to him-now I can only remember 5th floor) he said that in daylight, the direction at which the bright white object that turned green went on the horizontal level would have taken it into a shopping mall on Robertson Blvd. He said that was not logical. Furthermore, he said that green lights are a phenomenon that occurs around earthquakes and have nothing to do with UFO\u2019s.   His conclusion was that what we saw were those lights. Obviously, I forgot this man\u2019s name because he did not tell me what I wanted to hear.  He did not validate what we knew we saw, a UFO.  We knew it was a UFO and have known all this time. He had no explanation as to why the object changed color from white to green as it went horizontal and shot off faster than I can type it. We know what we saw was a UFO.  We were not UFO buffs at the time.  This thing or even seeing it was the farthest thing from our minds.  What I do know is this thing to me was real. It was an experience I will never forget, and it opened my mind to the fact that we are not alone. As a sidebar to this experience, when I took the film from our California trip to be developed the girl that was working at the photo shop asked me who was my trip.  Well, I told her all about the UFO. She told me that on her way to work a week earlier she saw a diamond shaped UFO which seemed to follow her from Plano, Texas, (along FM 544) to Carrollton, Texas, which is where the photo processing store was. Not just her, but suddenly I found out I knew other people who had seen UFO\u2019s right here in our area. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.",

I was lounging on my couch in my apt when the volume on my tv went mute.  I grabbed my remote when I realized I was hearing what sounded like either a rolling thunder or and aircraft.  I live on the second floor and my window was open two away from me.  The volume on my tv returned but I was puzzled because I was unsure where the sound was coming from. I turned the volume on my tv down to mute to verify what I was hearing not from the tv. The sound continued. It had been a clear day so thunder I thought was unlikely. The sound still persist, by this time at least 2 minutes had passed since my tv volume had first been interrupted. Out of curiosity I walked over to the window and there it was. The craft was ascending into the air very very slowly. It was not very high in the air, I would say maybe the height of a police helicopter. But I know it wasn't a copter for at least two reasons; 1.  There was no helicopter sound which I am very familiar with having grew up in the inner city and currently living within a mile of a police station.   2.  The lights on the craft where not at all like the typical search light you see on police helicopters. I am pretty certain that it was circular shape/disk shape. Although it did not seem thin or flat disk, it was thick or tall but it was more wide than tall by far. It seemed black or dark and it's figure was more of a shadow or outline. It had three very dark lights on it. There were two red lights on each end and on the left side just near the red light there was a blinking yellow light. I must stress that the lights were very clear and very bright! I followed the craft rising in the sky with my eyes until it went out of my line of sight through my window pane. I wanted to run down stairs an continue watching but I was in my undergarments. The sound which was jet and thunder like continued to persist. I scrabbed to my bedroom to find something to pit on, but by the time I reached the stairs the sound had ended. What I thought was strange about the sound was that it was quite powerful and was clearly being generated from this vessel however the craft itself was moving very very slow. I immediately sought out this web site because I am convinced that what I saw was an UFO. I live in the city I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters, and even those small planes that advertise signs and blimps. This was certaintly not a craft I am familar with. It was round and disk like, it's light was unusually, clear and bright, and it flew straight up! Very very slowly. I hope that someone else in this area saw it was I will not feel crazy.",

My camera is the Canon Power shot SD790 1S 10.0 Mega Pixel. They were fighting a fire that had started in the Los Angeles Lincoln Heights area, days later I was starting to look through my footage when I was rewinding in slow motion and saw an object flash? So I went frame by frame.  An Saucer like object stopped in mid air for 1.2 frames and was gone just as quick in another shot you can see a ball shaped object come from frame left to right and what seemed to pass in front of a LA city helicopter. The only reason I'm posting this is because I see on the 8th of June 2009 in Lincoln Heights someone else saw something to!  I really don't believe in UFO's but I can't ignore what I caught on my digital camera anybody else have any ideas on what this could have been?",

Last night, a friend of mine and I took our sons out Trick or Treating here in Westchester, California, just north of Los Angeles International Airport.  We ended up at our local park\u2019s Haunted House, and waited in the car for the kids to go through. We were parked facing North, and as we talked, I noticed a green flash of light streaking low across the sky. At first, I thought I was seeing fireworks, as the color was bright emerald green.   Then I realized it was ball shaped, and looked like a shooting star. Unlike a shooting star though, it seemed much lower in the sky, very close by, like fireworks would have been; and it was  moving horizontally through the sky, rather than the falling arc one usually sees with a \u201cshooting star.\u201d  There seemed to be some sparks coming off of it also, as if it were burning up in the atmosphere.  Then it just disappeared. My friend did not see this, although she was facing in the same direction.",

The atmospheric condition was partly cloudy. We had already started our descent and were probably about 3-4 miles up.  At approximately 18:30, about 30 minutes before we landed at LAX, I spotted a spherical metallic-looking object moving at approximately 150-400 mph either west-east or sw-ne about 1-2 miles above the ground, moving the exact opposite direction of the plane about a half mile to the south. It was about the size of a golf ball from about 100 yards.  ((sic--100 feet.)   I first spotted it at about 11:00 (direction, not time), and I was only able to view it for about 2-3 seconds before it disappeared from view. I didn\u2019t notice any lights on the object, but it was reflecting the sun which was low in the wsw which caused it to appear bright copper. I didn\u2019t notice any other physical features such as wings or a tail, and it didn\u2019t leave an exhaust stream.  I\u2019m 52 years old, and have been an amateur astronomer since I was a young child.  In my life, I\u2019ve seen just about anything you can think of in the sky, but never before last night have I ever seen an object that I could not identify.  I\u2019ve probably made over 40 cross-country flights, and am used to seeing planes and helicopters, but the object I saw last night didn\u2019t resemble anything I\u2019ve ever seen. Maybe it has a non-UFO explanation, but I decided to post the incident anyhow in hopes that someone else may have seen the object. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) This is a correction to my previous report submitted 09/17/08 at 14:17:09.  When I described the size of the object, it should have read:  It was about the size of a golf ball from about 100 feet.  (In my original submittal, I stated 100 yards.)",

At about 22:00 on the night of 12/6/08 I was walking on the West side of Los Angeles when I saw 2 oval like light shapes in the sky first moving in a crossing pattern around each other at what appeared to be tremendous speed.  Occasionally, the pattern broke off in to what appeared to be random movements and then returned to the pattern.  At one point 2 additional identical light shapes appeared in the sky, joined the criss cross pattern and disappeared shortly after. At first the lights were visible in the sky to the south and east of me, but at one point moved north and west for a brief time, continuing in the same pattern. But then returned to the south and east of me and remained there. The sky was partly cloudy that night, and the lights stayed behind the cloud cover.  So when I first saw them, I thought they might be the kind of spotlights that you see in the sky at big events.  But these were different because there was no beam of light from the ground that you usually see with those. And they were moving exponentially faster than the typical spotlight in the sky display.  They were also not ciruclar like the spotlights usually are.  When the 2 light shapes were moving through the sky, they would occasionally change direction, appearing to basically turn on a dime at incredibly high speed.   I've never seen anything like it and am at a loss for what it could be. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

My parents, who I live with, were at Mass and I stayed home doing my laundry and watching T.V in the garage.  I stepped outside for a minute to get some fresh air and to just cloud gaze and I noticed a white orb in the sky.  I could not tell how high it was or how big it was but I could tell it was white and appeared to be changing shape.  At first I thought it was a balloon or a plastic bag that had somehow got carried up by the wind to an unbelievable altitude but the object did not move.  It was unseasonably windy in L.A that day, which made the clouds coast by at a faster than normal speed but the object stayed stationary with out a sound.  After about 2 minutes of just staring at the object, I ran into the garage and took 2 pictures of the object and about 8 seconds of video. After the 8 seconds of video, my camera lost power for some reason.  The Photos were taken consecutively and the object appears to be in two different shapes.  The video is too grainy too see the object. After the camera lost power I went to the garage to put it back in the case. I went back outside and the object was gone.  I climbed on the roof of the garage to see if it had drifted or moved into the distance but there was no trace.  The timeframe of walking back into the garage had been about 9 seconds. I am baffled as to what the objects are but am very curious.",

I had trouble sleeping the night of my sighting, so I decided to go outside and water the back lawn.  I stepped out in the back patio and reached down to pick-up the water hose when I came back up I saw what at the moment I thought was a kite.  I immediately concluded that the object was not a kite because it stopped moving but continued to rotate clock-wise.  I stood and stared at the object to study its form, color, & shape.  This was the (MOST Obscure Object) I have ever seen\u2026 I also noticed that this object made absolutely no noise, and the most interesting aspect about it is its shape.  The object looked like a vertebrae or back bone and has it rotated it seemed to be flexing in a cumbersome motion. The color was a faded florescent blue, and the light that it emitted was even throughout the entire shape and form of the object. The size could have been 7-10 ft long and 2-3ft in diameter. The distance was about 40-50ft above me and facing north towards the Hollywood Hills. I ! wanted to go get my camera that was sitting on my desk so I backed away from the object to my back door keeping my eyes on it so I don\u2019t lose track of its position. I ran to my desk grabbed my camera and ran back out to my patio. The object was no-longer in its previous position, It had climbed vertically straight up at what I estimated to be 1-2 thousand ft. I turned off the LCD display on my camera to see if I can acquire it through the view finder. I could not see the object, but I snapped 4 succession pictures in the general direction of the object. I could still observe the object with the naked eye but could not see it through the camera. I continued to watch the object for about another minute \u00bd then it passed out of view completely. I then placed a call to the (LAPD) to file a report. The Officer who handled the call listened intently and asked me 1 or 2 questions, and then offered to send out a chopper that was in the area to see if they could intercept the object.! I said go ahead but that I could not see the object anymore s! o it wou ld be impossible for me to give any position of where it might be at that moment. The Officer thanked me for calling and said that it was an interesting conversation and that if the object returns to call again immediately. I then called (MUFON) but got no answer.  After that night I had tried to make sense of what I had seen that night and the only explanation I can come up with is that it could (NOT) have been anything explained in conventional terms and it seemed to be under intelligent control because it stopped in mid-air almost at the exact moment I took notice of the object. It was like the object was watching me has I was watching the object.  And when I returned outside this thing had traveled straight up vertically 1-2 thousand ft, from the point and position from where I left it to grab my camera. This was truly the most strangest sighting I have ever experienced\u2026 I have had an Abduction experience when I was 6 years old, and throughout my life I have had UFO sighti! ng of all different types, but nothing like the 1 I had this night. I did a little research into this object and there was some video on YouTube pertaining to a sighting that Story Musgrave the Astronaut had videotaped from the Space Shuttle. Here the YouTube video Link that will give some idea to what I witnessed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jotdaXX1w2A The object I saw moved in the exact same way has the video clip of the Story Musgrave Sightings. Its form or shape hard to determine whether it\u2019s the same Object. But its movement is identical to my sighting. This sends chills up my spine when I think about it. I keep asking myself what could it have been??? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Stationary black triangle over LAX area during crowded morning traffic on highway 405, Los Angles This happened in 1986, and I've finally figured it's time to tell this story after all these years. Because I've worked for some law enforcement support companies, I've always hesitated to do anything that could have been a \u201cproblem\u201d at work. This happened in the week around Easter, 1986 in Los Angeles. I was working for a special effects company that mainly worked doing laser EFX for rock tours, motion pictures. Our shop was in W. LA, and I had a job installing a laser system at the Spruce Goose theater in Long Beach, CA. I had been working there every day including the holiday to get the show ready for the grand opening, and with the bad LA traffic at that time, I had to leave the shop very early to make it to Long Beach in time to get in at least 8 hours. \tOn this morning, it would have been about 7-8 a.m. Traffic on the 405 going south was very, very slow, and with lots of stops and starts. I had just passed LAX airport on my right, and was in the area where there were lots of defense contractors such as the huge TRW and Hughes plants. I was in a second from the outside right lane of traffic, and all the cars had come to a stop. I was just glancing around, waiting to get moving again when I happened to look up. I did this a lot in that area as there were many large commercial jets in the area landing at LAX and it was something to do while stalled in traffic. I had heard a plane nearby, and as I looked up, I could see a fairly large, and completely stationary black triangle hovering possibly as much as 500ft over the buildings off to my right. It just hung in the air, as if frozen. There were no lights, noise of any engine, and it was a dark flat black in color. I thought that it was very, very odd, but considering the area that I was in, I considered that it may have been some exotic antenna that was being tested at Hughes, etc. Then it crossed my mind that it would have been very hazardous to have something like that so close to commercial aircraft in flight. \tI watched this triangle for maybe 2 minutes, and at one point, the driver in the car next to me was looking at me staring up through my windshield. I looked at him, and motioned with my finger to look up, which he did. He looked directly at this same object for about 30 seconds, then looked back at me and shrugged as if to say, \u201cI don't know what it is either.\u201d. At this point, traffic started to move again, and I tried to watch for as long as possible at this object, but I quickly had to put my attention to driving again and once I could not see it from my front windshield, I lost view of it. On the trip home that evening, I made a point of slowing down at the same location to take a look, and there was nothing that I could see, however it was dark out by then. Just lots of normal aircraft lights at that time. For the next 4-5 days as I continued on that project, I made a point of looking every time I was in that area, but never have seen the object since. \tThe size to me may have been about 50 feet wide, with almost a perfect triangle shape. The thickness was hard to judge, but I would say maybe 5 feet. I looked very closely to see if there was a tether as there were lots of advertising balloons in the area along the 405, but there were none that I could see, however the object's lack of movement made it appear as if it was tethered. It is windy in that area from the air coming in from the nearby Pacific Ocean. The \u201cpoint\u201d or nose of this shape would have been pointing NE, about 2 miles south of LAX on the west side of the highway above industrial buildings. I believe there was a wide bend or curve at the point of the highway. I have not seen any object like that before or since that day. It does remind me of the appearance of the stealth aircraft that many of these companies in that area most likely worked on, and I have always had a thought that what I saw that day may have had something to with that, however at that time, those programs were all still very secret I believe. Oh, the sky was clear and blue, and with the morning sun coming up, and not much pollution yet from traffic. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

May 1980 Los Angeles California, approximately 4:00 am.  Clear dark sky. I was 15 years old walking with my oldest sister on 9th street towards downtown Los Angeles, CA. Heading for the Greyhound depot.  It was dark and quiet.  All I had in mind was the approaching boycotted Moscow Olympic games. A small spheric light appeared traveling horizontally in a straight line, and paralleling 9th street (West to East).  At a height of, I would say, half the height of the terrorized 9/11 tween towers of New York. No sound at all. It left no trail behind (as an asteroid would).  It did not appear to be descending or decelerating.  A very stable and fast speed. It disappeared in the skyline of downtown Los Angeles. Feeling disturbed, I turned around and asked my sister,\"did you see that?\". \"Ahu..yes\", she responded.  We both kept walking disturbed and quiet since it was too early in the morning and we were still sleepy. A few minutes later, I still asked,\"did you really see it?  It was a light bulb, or something like that..right?\" She responded, \"yes\". What ??  A LIGHT BULB ? ?  IT WENT INTO ONE OF THE BUILDINGS, OR IN BETWEEN THEM, OR SOMETHING !\", I said again. My sister was, I believe 18 years old, and I'm sure her mind was into guys most of the time. The spheric light we saw seemed as big as tower window.  I can compare it so because there were many buildings around where we last saw it. That left me a question mark for ever.  I know I will never see that again.

Didnt think much of it at first till i noticed it wasnt moving with the air how a balloon would typically do. I've seen balloons float before in the area because people usually have partys around holidays or on the weekends and they always float in a north east direction and these objects were and stayed in  a south east direction from where we were standing. Thats when i told my brother if he was seeing what Im seeing and I told him how it was weird how its kinda just sitting there. that when i started recording and i noticed it was moving back and forth, told my brother and he noticed it too. We noticed it was moving back and forth because of the tree. Of course the tree is stationary and you can see in the video how the star/balloon UFO was moving back and forth. my brother ran inside to get the tripod kuz it was difficult to zoom and focus of the object, then we lost it. I continued to look for it up in the sky and found it again, I tryied recording it but it was too small to focus on. Then i noticed that there was another next to it and it seemed as if they were playing (they were moving close and away from each other). Seconds later I lost sight of them again and then noticed a third maybe twice as far or small as the previous and it simply blended into the blue sky.",

LAX Airport is 2 miles North.   What I saw was an opaque Triangle structure that was letting NO light thru.  It was casting very strait lines shadows onto the other clouds to the East of it.  Very strange..it looked better in person.  However in the video I have attached ...The light from the sun setting is being altered at the bottom of the Triangle.  You can see a very solid horizontal line parallel to the water above the sun setting.  It also looked as if something was cloaking (cloud)in the top right of the triangle.  Slow it down...speed it up...the video does show what i saw.  A huge opaque triangle over LAX.  If you fiddle with the contrast and color..you can see it a little better.  If you have video enhancing software to play with the video to bring out the triangle ship, I would appreciate a copy.  I know I saw something!  Maybe someone else did too?",

      "story": "anomalous red blinking light moved silently over rooftops in a residential neighborhood I had just arrived at my mother\u2019s house in LA after driving from Northern California. On the ride down I stopped first in a place called \u201cArea 101\u201d where I spoke with a number of UFO enthusiasts about the contact movement\u2019s program of interacting with the intelligence (presumably ET) behind the UFO phenomenon. From there I headed south and met with a young man who described his having positive interactions with what he identified as ETs throughout his life with numerous sightings that he claimed had an interactive component. After I explained to him a term that I have coined called \u201cprime contactee (reserved for individuals who can request a sighting and actually have one occur)  he thought that he definitely was a \u201cprime.\u201d   At my Mom\u2019s house in Koreatown I brought my luggage up to the second floor and looked out through a screen window. It was 1:45 AM. The lights of the city reflecting off the overcast skies lit up the neighborhood. The silhouettes of palm trees graced the horizon. I gazed out to the west and immediately noticed a blinking stationary red light about ten degrees above the rooftops of the surrounding two story homes.  For many years I have looked through that window on visits to LA and can never recall seeing such a light in the sky before. It was difficult to judge its distance as there were no landmarks behind it. It was relatively large, about a finger breaths wide at arms full length. In trying to figure our what it was my first thought was of  flashing red lights on a radio antennae array some 3 miles to the west.  They are not visible from my Mom\u2019s house and besides this light was solitary and far too large. As I had this thought the light began to slowly move horizontally to the north. This was no stationary aircraft beacon sitting on an antenna. Police helicopters routinely patrol this part of central LA and the light was not part of any fixed or rotating wing aircraft. At this late hours all was quiet in  this heavily residential neighborhood. The red pulsating object, circular in shape moved behind a tree. I waited for it to emerge into view on the other side. It did not. I wait! ed and scanned the sky and listened intently for the sound of aircraft. None  could be was heard. Was this just another \"random sighting?\" Or could it have been a consciousness mediated show of support for my networking efforts among the UFO experiencers that I like to call \"the contact underground?\" My guess is that it was a show of support because the next day I got a call from a contact team leader who told me that her skywatch team had a sighting of a round red UFO at midnight the previous night. It was less than two hours before my sighting. Coincidence? Perhaps but I don't think so! ((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report is a competent investigator in the field of ufology, and we suspect that this is a quite accurate report.  PD))",

      "story": "Silver Objects Hovering Above Los Angeles It has taken me some time to finally write about this issue.  For a number of years now I have seen either a single star like object in the daytime very high up hovering in the sky or I have seen a formation of these same objects.  On one occasion I was with two other individuals and pointed them out and they saw them and we watched them move and hover in ways that no traditional aircraft operate. I am writing this now because this past weekend on two consecutive days (August 9th and 10th) I saw a single silver star like object motionless in the daytime sky. Both days were perfect weather wise with very clear visibility. On August the 9th in the afternoon at about 4 PM PST I noticed a silver colored point of light hovering in Eastern Sky perhaps 50 to 55 degrees from the horizon. I thought it might be a plane moving away from me and the sun was reflecting on it at an odd angle. But it just hung there with what I thought was perhaps a vibrating like movement. My wife was standing with me holding our 3 month old as we were preparing to go on a walk and she saw it as well. After about 3 to 5 minutes we couldn\u2019t see it anymore. It appeared to just fade away but not like an object moving off \u2013 it either faded out or turned in such a way that the sun wasn\u2019t hitting it. I think it important to note that the light may have been the sun reflecting off the object but while the object appeared very small and far away it was star like and obviously bright enough to been seen by the naked eye. The following day on the 10th at approximately 5:30 in the afternoon I again took the baby outside to sit on our front porch swing which faces east. I had this odd feeling that I would see the object again and when I looked up between two nearby trees there it was again in the sky. The object was higher this time but brighter and closer to my position. It began to slowly drift a bit from North to South and I knew in a moment it would be obscured by the leaves of one of the trees. Now I don\u2019t know why but I tried, perhaps foolishly, to meditate on the object and make a \"connection,\" but it just kept drifting very, very slowly south. It was not a balloon, plane or helicopter and again the sky was perfectly clear and visibility was excellent. It would soon be out of my view so I slowly got up and went to see it from the front yard but when I looked up again it was gone. I searched the sky but to no avail. The entire encounter again lasted maybe five minutes but certainly less than ten. I am writing to you because I have seen these objects in the sky in LA before. They are not traditional aircraft. In the past I have seen them in formation and have seen them do patterns and maneuvers that, in my opinion, can not be easily explained. I have seen them with others present so I know I\u2019m not just imagining things. Could these be the US military aerial Predator drones? I was thinking perhaps they are tested out from a nearby base. Wouldn\u2019t they hover at high altitude? Could I just be seeing a satellite in geosynchronous orbit?

I looked up, and alomost diredctly overhead, perhaps a mile high, was this white spehere with 3 points on it - north, east and west.  This is exactaly how it appeared to me.  Picture a circle with three triangular points.  It looked like Sputnik, only it was hovering in the air for all to see, amd it moved very slowly across the sky, making this constant humming/ring.  It was a high pitched sound.  The sound was constant, no other tone sounds, no pulse to it, no rythm.  I walked up to the vice principal of the school and asked him, \"What is that thing?\"   He looking at it too... He said \"I don't know\".  After several minutes it just moved out of sight.  It was hard to tell if it was changing altitude, moving higher.  Somtime later, in class, we heard the ringing sound again.   We did not go outside to investigate, and the sound did not last very long. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

When I focused on it, I noticed it was an object that was just hovering in the sky, almost like a star... it would flash, then kind of blend in with the sky momentarily to where it almost looked like it dissappeared but you could still faintly see the outline of it, then it would reappear again.  Several more appeared, we counted a total of 5.  They were just hovering, pretty high up.  At one point they changed formation into a triangle, then they got so close together I thought they had merged into one. They were changing formation but not really going anywhere. It looked like they were changing color, from light green to silver, and then transparent again. We watched it for about 5-10 minutes until we got too far! for our eyes to see them anymore. My sister and I both got some footage of it using our digital cameras on full zoom, not very good footage but if you watch it frame by frame on the video you can see the objects appear and move around.  My sister only took about 5 seconds of footage because she didnt think she caught them on video, but on her video, you can actually see what looks like a transparent object fly by, flanked by the smaller shiny objects that we saw... pretty cool",

Most of the objects looked round but some were triangle shaped.  Most were moving slowly west but, some just hoovered in one spot.  One hoovered for 30 min and then slowly moved north.  I went to the army surplus across the street and told the guys working there about the objects.  They got some binoculars and we looked at one of the objects.  Through the bino's I could see that the object was 3 white orbs held in a triangle frame like thing.  And as we watched another white object moved toward this 3-orbed object and was very neat it before it vanished.  All of the objects were very high up.  When jets would pass by , one could see that these objects were way higher in the sky than the jets. The objects made no sound , they made turns, changed directions , and moved in straight lines as well as hovering.  NO high speed stuff.   One thing I noticed, when I was looking at some of these objects, I would notice another similar object  behind the object I was looking at that was much much higher up. ((NUFORC Note:",

I stared at it more because I was thinking maybe the lights are delaying or something but to my surprise it started to dim out real slow when it completely turned off.  As it was off you could tell it was round and it looked white or grey,  I kept my eye on it for about fifteen seconds when it started going out of my vision that\u2019s when I jumped back into my car and tried to follow it but it was too late. As I got home and started to park I saw two lights that definitely looked like the same light I had just seen and these lights looked pretty big to be a plane and they also were not flashing, just a deep, bright red orange light that reminds you of the color of fire. It almost looked like it was on fire.  As I got off the car I was watching these two lights travel slow next to each other but they had a distance. The light that was on the left side dimmed maybe ten seconds after I was watching both of them and the second light took longer to turn off but as I was watching that light I was examining it more to rule out the theory of this object being out of the ordinary and I truly found this object fascinating. I know for a fact it did not have any flashing lights at all it was just glowing that red orange color, and I found it so weird how it turned itself off and you can still see the object moving in the sky, if this was an airplane or a man made object it made some illega! l moves by not having flashing lights and flying in the sky with its lights off.  If anyone else saw this, please I would very much love to hear about it.  I want to know if I was the only one to see this.  Those lights caught my eye right away so I bet it did the same to another person.  Please let me know I need to know if I was the only one person to witness this.",

Although I couldn\u2019t give an exact altitude at which they were traveling, I can say they seemed a lot higher in the sky than the airliners stacked headed into LAX.  Their brightness was that of the other stars in the sky and remained consistent till I lost sight of them due to the light pollution here in the city. As for their speed, they crossed the sky in about 3 seconds or so.  No noise was associated from these lights either. I tried to look up information about meteors that can make that pattern as they come in but could not find any.

It was a very quiet day with very little air traffic.   As I was looking at the clear blue sky I saw a tiny white dot almost overhead about the size of a dull pencil tip at arms length. I looked at it for a bit more and grabbed a pair of binoculars I had nearby, it appeared to be &quot;metallic&quot; white in color, oval in shape with a dark coloration toward the bottom of the object.

      "story": "A dark rectangular object appears over my car out on the road and telepathically tells me not to panic, that I knew it was there. OVERHEAD UFO ON INTERSTATE 10  This incident is the reason for my interest in UFOs...why I\u2019m          a member of MUFON.  The year was the summer of \u201976, August. I was driving back from a visit to San Antonio, Texas, and had just seen a sign saying \u201cL.A. 90 miles\u201d at around 1 a.m.  I knew I was pretty tired, and this meant nearly 2 hours yet to go.  I was leaning back in the driver\u2019s seat, feeling fatigue. Suddenly, surprising even myself, I took a deep breath and threw myself forward, now leaning over the steering wheel, now my head way under the windshield.  I glanced up...and there, overhead, maybe 15, 20 feet above the car, just beginning to fall behind, was a dark rectangular (I assumed, since the rear was out of sight, so it might\u2019ve been square) object, keeping pace with the car.  I felt a wave of fear striving to strike me... I startle easily...  And then the following 3 sentences were planted in my head telepathically... as clearly as if I were hearing them,  but I knew my brain, not my ears, was picking them up...  \u201cDon\u2019t panic.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re in no danger.\u201d  Before I could feel relief upon \u201chearing\u201d those two sentences then came...  \u201cYou knew it was there anyway.\u201d  And I was seized by a terrific jolt of fear!  I quickly pulled to the side of the road, shaking, fully expecting some kind of attack. I thought I might be incinerated...lifted up by a tractor beam, then dropped...something life-threatening.  But nothing happened. And now I wanted to get out and see if I could still detect the object. But I didn\u2019t want to do that without a possible attack being seen by another driver. Not that I felt anyone could help me, but at least if someone witnessed my demise, he or she could make a report to the police and my family would know what had become of me.  Just as I was lamenting that no one was there to be my witness, over the top of the hill ahead came 3 sets of headlights.  Now I had witnesses, and as they approached, I stepped out of the car, hesitantly and fearfully turned around to view...nothing unusual in the sky. The object was gone.  Ever since then, I\u2019ve been left to wonder...what does \u201cYou knew it was there anyway\u201d mean? Is it evidence that I\u2019ve been traced, tracked, followed my whole life and know it on a subconscious level?  Does this explain why from the age of about 4 to 7 years old I kept having a recurring dream and telling my parents in the morning that \u201cI woke up again \u2018cause I knew this big eye was looking at me real hard on the other side of the black, so I never can see it...but I know it\u2019s there\u201d? Of course asked in children\u2019s language.  Does it explain an orb the size of a tennis ball coming down the hallway at my grandparents\u2019 home at about 11:30 one summer night, slowly circling through the room, then crossing through it to stop over my head as I observed through the weave of the sheet that I\u2019d pulled over my head out of fear...that then grew whiter and brighter and brighter till I \u201cwhited out\u201d... and then woke up at what seemed to be instants later, even though it was about 9 a.m.? I was about 12 for that occurrence.  And did it have anything to do with several significant precognitive dreams I\u2019ve experienced through my life and other paranormal happenings, such as dreaming my cat had been shot while I was traveling in Europe and coming back home to find she had been, though not killed as in the dream?  \u201cYou knew it was there anyway.\u201d  It\u2019s set me on a lifelong search.  Oh, by the way, after this incident, the following spring \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d came out. I about flipped out in the scene where Richard Dreyfus experiences loose objects flying around in the cab of his car, looks carefully and shakily out the windshield, and sees down the road a dark rectangular UFO meandering ahead of him... almost precisely my own experience.  It was almost d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!  And of course convinced me I\u2019d had a significant, maybe life-altering experience.

I was working field patrol as a law enforcement officer (15 years experience) when I noticed Venus shining brightly in the pre-dawn morning sky.  I went to the top floor (7th) of a near-by parking structure to use my binoculars to get a better look.  I was using low powered binoculars to observe Venus and Jupiter, which were approx. 30 degrees up from the eastern horizon.   As I trained the binoculars on Venus, a dark colored object \"floated\" into my field of view.  The object was oblong to egg-shaped and seemed not to hold a steady form.  There were no visible lights emitting from the object.  The object appeared to hover in a stationary position before beginning to &quot;drift&quot; in a southern direction.   It continued south for approx. 2 minutes, then made a distinct and sudden turn west.  The object increased it's speed as it moved west for approx. 10 seconds, then continued to hover.  I lowered the binoculars to attempt to view it with my &qu! ot;naked&quot; eye, with negative results.  I re-engaged the binoculars and again saw the object in about the same position.  I lowered the binoculars again to try and find something to lean against to steady my view through the binoculars.  Approx. 20 seconds passed before I re-engaged the binoculars, but could not re-located the object.  I spent the next 10 minutes using the binoculars to scan the area in a &quot;strip search&quot; pattern to try and re-locate the object, with negative results. The sky was cloudless with a hint of marine layer haze, low on the horizon.  The object appeared to be at an altitude greater than 10,000ft., though I can't validate that without knowing it's size.  I did not see any light reflecting from the object, despite the approaching sunrise (it should have been high enough to have been above the earth's shadow).  It was dark colored, close to black, and seemed to absorb light.  I did not hear any sound I could associate with the object.

There were no sounds that we could hear of.  The lead circle would pulsate slightly and then die off.  Because it was dark, we weren\u2019t sure if it blacked out or was masked by clouds.    About 10 seconds after, the second blacked out.  My wife went back into the house and I continued to walk the dog around the neighborhood.  Approximately 3 minutes later, I saw a third red/orange circle trailing the same route as the first two.   After about 1 to 2 minutes, the third blacked out as well.  I saw regular aircraft in the vicinity of these circles.  It was obvious that these red circles did not fit the profile of a normal aircraft.   Additionally, the movement was unnatural to a regular aircraft. It would shif! t mid-air.  When I got back into the house, my wife researched this to see if anyone else saw this pattern.  On the UFO Reporting Center, the description matched similar reports. I\u2019m a former Marine Corps Officer with a MBA and my wife has a masters as well.

      "story": "In 1954, I saw a red glowing disc traveling thousands of mph straight over the Los Angeles night sky. I was 11 years old in 1947 and lived in south central Los Angeles at the time of the \"flying saucer\" siting.  It was night time and my friend and I saw a red glowing disk traveling at enormous speeds, southeast to northwest over Los Angeles. The flying saucer was very high in a super clear night sky. I'm a college graduate and worked for Lockheed Martin Corp. for 39 years and retired 3 years ago.  I'm 69.  I'm an amateur astronomer and I am familiar with the night sky, stars and planets.  I would call myself a &quot;trained observer&quot; having lived near airports and now near Cape Canaveral, Florida where missiles commonly take off.  I was also in the Air Force with the Hayward National Guard in California.  My point is that I know what I am looking at and can judge speed and altitude as well as identify night time objects in the sky. I have always described the flying saucer I saw as a looking like a round red Ford tail light of the 1950s traveling at an altitude above 30,000 feet and probably much higher (70,000 feet or more).  So, I estimate the flying saucer was at least twice the size of a modern airliner at 30,000 feet, bigger if it was higher.  The glowing red \"saucer\" appeared to be a perfect disk, not a ball.  The glowing red disk had no other features.  As I say, the speed of the round red disk was enormous flying horizon to horizon in less than 20 seconds at an extremly high altitude plastered against the roof one of the best night skys I have ever seen which is why my friend and I were looking up at the time.  We caught site of the glowing red disk about 30 degrees above the horizon to the southeast and watched it disappear to the northwest. My date of the siting is approximate as to month and time, but I'm pretty sure it was 1954 judging by the events going on in my life at the time.  It was a warm summer evening, and I was taking my friend home on the handle bars of my bicycle at the time as we were marveling at the clarity of the night sky and the stars. The reason that I believe it was a \"flying saucer\" is because no aircraft of the times in 1954 or now could even begin to match the speeds of this object.  This red glowing disk left no trail like a fireball meteor which I have also seen.  It just zipped across the L.A. night sky in a straight line horizon to horizon in a matter of seconds never losing its circular (disk-like) shape or losing speed or altitude.  It left no trail or emited sound.  If I was going to guess at the speed and altitude of the flying saucer I saw, I would say it was flying at 70,000 feet or more at speeds of tens of thousands of miles per hour.  This was not a common site in 1954 or even now with our rockets and satellites which I am also very familiar with having worked for Lockheed Corp and living now near Cape Canaveral, Florida.  Nothing in our arsenal of jets and rockets flys anywhere near as fast the flying saucer I saw that summer night in 1954. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

At first, the object hovered over the Federal building, which is a quarter of a mile south of the UCLA campus on Wilshire Blvd.  Our building is approx. 1 \u00bc miles southeast of the Federal Building.  The object glowed with a bright white light, which was significantly larger than any star or planet in the night sky. The object dropped quickly like a falling star out of sight.  Fifteen seconds later, it rose again.  The light changed to blue, then green, then red as it moved east much more quickly than a helicopter.  It zigzagged and changed direction and altitude very quickly.  At times, several colored lights appeared at once.   The round object was higher than the 12 story buildings over which it flew.   Finally, after three or four minutes, it dropped out of sight, near the UCLA campus.",

They were flying in a straight line, then two went up and the other two went beneath and they formed like a square.   As we continued to watch shortly after there were three more and they flew toward the other four and they were all just hovering. \tA helicopter came to investigate and as it got closer it started to rise toward the fireballs.  The first four at that time just dimmed out.  The helicopter turned toward the other three and went forward a bit.  The other three dimmed out as well.  Then we noticed another fireball about twice the size of the first seven coming from the west toward the helicopter.  At this time the helicopter turned to the east and left.   The larger fire ball slowed and began to move north bound and just zipped out of sight. \tAbout 3 min. later my son and I heard some loud pops and two flares were shot in the direction were all the activity had been happening.   At no time did these fireballs make any sound that we could hear.  We live in the path where commercial airplanes pass on a regular basis, on their way to the airport.  These were not airplanes!

Again I was at my home but in my back yard being curious from the last time I spotted the 2 UFO's I now have a habit of looking into the sky during the day time to see if there are anymore. At 5:35 pm I spotted an oval metallic object floating very high and very still in the North-West direction in the sky I would say in the direction of El Sereno area.  I couldn't believe how perfectly still this object was. This object was different from the last sighting this object was metallic in nature. I ran and grabbed my camera hoping it would still be there and snapped a few shots as best I could.   Then I seen a 2nd object fly slowly just below and past the 1st object heading North-East.  This object was round and appeared to be like one glowing red light.  It was traveling East very slowly I tried to keep an eye on both objects looking back at the metallic oval object which was still hovering in the same position.  I snapped a few photos of the glowing red light object then watched it fly slowly and then lost sighting of it after 10 minutes.  When I looked back to look for the metallic oval object it was gone.  A few minutes later a jet flew by from the south direction going north I would say it was almost as high as the two unidentified objects.  I snapped a photo of the jet so I can make comparisons of how high the jet was to the unidentified objects.  The metallic oval object stood hovering for 15 minutes and the glowing red light object slowly for about 10 minutes.",

As they approached the shoreline, they made a sweeping turn skyward and ascended through the low cloud cover, straight up, and faded away.

Observing aircraft taking off from LAX only a few minutes later,  I have to also add that the light or energy emitted from these objects must have been high in intensity as lights from aircraft were only visible at close distances, given the light fog and low clouds.  I drove my Avon inflatable to the middle of the channel where one of the four story party boats was coming back in from the Harbor entrance area.  I was able to confirm with the! crew on the bridge that we all had in fact seen the same unexplainable lights.

It had no lights at all and I couldn't pick up on any sound from it. It appeared to be a gray color, it blended almost seamlessly with the sky. There was a small prop plane in the sky as well in my vision of the sky, but it seemed to be civilian and at a much lower altitude. I turned to tell my roommate, couldn't get his attention, looked back, and I couldn't spot it again. I did some looking at drones online and the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 looks similar to what I saw, but the V wasn't as wide as the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 a! ppears to look.

I was walking down Santa Monica Blvd towards Century City when I noticed a white dot in the sky traveling with a fair amount of speed, in a south west direction.  It was obviously not an airplane and my thought was it was probably a large white balloon.   I took out a pair of binoculars I had with me to get a better look at it.  Balloons typically have strings attached and rock a bit due to being heavier at the bottom but this did not.  It just appeared to be a white orb....at first. The object then seemed to stop moving west and seemed to begin to ascend a bit, then remaining suspended in the same location for about 10-15 minutes.  During this time it would occasionally slowly change from white to glowing orange, and back.  It did this two or three times.  It then began to move back in the direction from which it came, and then towards me.  I believe at this point it was higher than it had initially been.  It changed to orange one more time, and back to white, and then I lost track of it after I put the binoculars down to rest my arms. I don't believe this was a balloon as it did not exhibit a string or characteristic rocking.  I believe the orange coloring was emitted light rather than reflected light, because the sun was not low enough in the sky to cause an orange reflection, the change from white to orange to white occurred slower than expected if it were an object turning such to reflect light, and when objects in the sky reflect light, the intensity usually increases to a bright point quickly, and then decreases quickly.  This object did none of these things. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

It moved slower than a plane or a helicopter would travel and then as I proceeded to start driving almost directly underneath I could tell then that there were actually two unidentified flying objects. At this point in time now (approximately five minutes after my initial sighting) I could tell that there were two objects; one craft was distinctly triangular in shape and had a different colored light at each corner. One light was red, the other was green, and the other was a faint greenish/whitish color.  The lights were going off in an irregular pattern. The other UFO was hard to look at, as the two white lights on it were so bright, I was not able to tell the space of the object itself.  Both of the UFOS were now absolutely stationary in the sky directly over the 405 freeway near Westwood.  They were not moving at all for approximately five minutes, and after that point my car had driven far too south on the freeway for this scene to still be in my view.

Finally, a darker (Golden Black) bright object (can\u2019t quite describe its shape) showed in the middle of the formed triangle, and that\u2019s when they stopped hovering, formed one last straight line.  Darker object started vanishing, followed by the three white bright objects, until became way too far to be visible. Last but not least, it\u2019s has always been a hypnotizing experience, where I can\u2019t look away and my surroundings seem to have vanished.  Each of my sightings lasted about 6-10 seconds, yet it felt timeless. Thank you so much in advance.",

      "story": "Strange directional &quot;swoosh&quot; sound in the sky near LAX draws attention of 3 witnesses to look up at an empty sky I was returning a rental car at the Hertz rental car return facility near LAX, as I have done many times before at this same location (probably more than 50 times). This day there were 2 ladies processing my return, which is unusual since normally it's a one-on-one transaction.  The three of us were standing next to the car and going through the routine process which includes questions like \"did you replace the fuel\" and so on. I always hear planes flying above that location, as the place is located at the foot of the runway.  This time, though, I heard a very strange sound that was somewhat similar to a jet but sounded \"broken\", as if it was digitally altered to sound like special FX for a movie. It was like a loud \"swoosh\" sound that appeared to go by in the sky above us.  The sound moved in the same direction as the planes normally do as they land, that is, westbound towards the ocean.  Instinctively, and immediately, I looked up and scanned the sky from my right to my left, following the sound, only to see a clear blue sky with absolutely nothing in my entire field of view, as far as I could see in all directions, except for the late afternoon Sun.  I have seen many planes fly above my head at that location before, and sometimes I look up and sometimes not.  This time, the unusual sound drove me to immediately look up because I was curious to see what kind of aircraft made that strange sound.  But with the sky being empty, in the end the only thing that caught my attention was the fact that one of the ladies processing my car return, who was standing in front of me and facing my direction, did the exact same head motion that I did, except she was going from her left to her right, so that we were both scanning the same section of the sky at the same time. At this point, the other lady said, \"That didn't sound like a plane, it sounded like water!\".  I understood what she meant - that it sounded sort of like a wave at the beach, or a cross between that and a jet plane flying by if you can imagine what that would sound like.  It was her interpretation of the sound, just as I gave my interpretation above. So this is not a report of a \"sighting\" per se, but I believe I heard a UFO instead of seeing one.  Right after the fact, I remember thinking to myself that the simultaneous head motion of the lady standing in front of me made me feel validated, and that there was no reason to question myself about whether I really heard a sound that appeared to come from an invisible source. For the record, I am an IT Consultant and I travel for work.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Although I'm not adverse to being contacted about this event,  I believe I have provided all the information available.  I am making this report in case there are other people out there who had a similar experience, so that perhaps collectively the reports can have statistical significance or provide some clue about the phenomenon.",

Also, someone in the valley saw a very similar thing and posted the pics in Coast to Coast around the same time.  I will include the pics, as it is what we saw, but we saw it at night)  My wife and I were watching a noisy helicopter hovering two blocks away.  After turning away for a moment, I saw a flaming orange and red shape hovering roughlyidqay between is and the chopper.  The glowing flaming object was about 1/2 way between us and the helicopter, just above the tree line, now abot 3/4 of a city block from us. The bright object was amorphous, I could see flames rising from parts of it.  The shape was rather fluid, morphing a bit like mercury, changing shapes.  It it looked a Bit like a pair of wings to me at times, my wife saw a triangle as well, as did I, as it flowed smoothly into different forms of bright glowing orange red light. It was perfectly silent. It was not an airplane, drone, chopper, or toy hover craft or miniature chopper. It hovered, came towards us a bit, dipped down 20 degrees, swung due west, and eventually arced up steeply and went black or vanished abruptly. It was a clear night in the Pico - Robertson area of Los Angeles, near 8 pm The object was most dramatic and out of place, yet- no one seemed to notice oneoremlight in the sky.  As I pointed it out to my wife, it seemed to flow a bit brighter, and definately moved innocently a bit closer to us, or rather in our direction, and seemed to present a bit of a flourish In our direction as it made its exit, in a steep upward angle. It looked like firey glowing wings a good bit, which is meaningful to me personally; also, my Wife is an Indian Tribal member, and her tribes name translates as \"Keepers of the Fire\".",

At first I thought it was just the strobe from an airplane, but after watching for a few seconds,  I concluded it was not.  This light was flashing at irregular intervals and intensities, and would hoover in one spot before moving slightly and slowly to another spot.  I went inside to get my binoculars to get a better look, and saw much the same.  The object would flash irregularly with varying intensities and move slowly in one direction, and then change directions, sometimes moving up, down or back to its previous spot.  When I got tired of looking up and went inside after about 10 minutes, it had left the boundaries of Orion and was lingering a bit to the right of it.

A cir A circular craft hovered 100 feet off the ground for an hour or more.  The craft was identifiable and appeared to be \"cloaked\" or partially invisible.  The circular craft had lights around the perimeter of the \"object\" that in a specific pattern appeared to rotate clockwise and then converged to the center \"middle of the craft like something focusing energy to the center.  The craft was extremely close to our proximity as we were directly under the object.  The craft looked to be constructed of a plant/animal like an organic material  which had what appeared to be hieroglyphic type of symbols or markings one of which looked like a snake another like an eye.  The craft had an area towards the center that had a cutout and we could see \"beings\" what appeared to be working and at one point I felt like they were communicating to us through thoughts.  My partner could not believe what we were observing and quickly grabbed his professional camera to record this spectacular occurrence in high definition while simultaneously recording with our smartphones.  We have 3 different videos from 3 separate devices.  He is also with the media and we have worked together on many news events over the years.  There  sound was mostly silent however there was a frequency that gave us a \"safe\" feeling that seemed to be pulsing with the movement of illuminations \"iridescent lights\" it felt like we were floating but the video did not capture either of us floating or defying 3D laws of physics.  There was someone outside and we have never seen that person before.  He claimed to be a neighbor and seemed uninterested in the object that was the size of the Staples Center (sports arena/stadium). Suddenly after an hour of our observation, the craft seemed to fire some kind of blue/green- and red laser/photons that dematerialized the enormous craft and seemed to \"warp\" into thin air.  Again, we are both journalist and work in \"mainstream media\" we have been sitting on these videos for approximately a week as to investigate if any other videos or sightings were reported.  We cannot conclude if there were additional witnesses to this remarkable occurrence.  The exact location was about 4 miles from USC in Los Angeles.  The proximity of the object in reference to our location had to literally be 100-300 feet above us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "3 fiery red lights flying in formation over east Los Angeles. I was sitting on the couch watching TV at my friend\u2019s apartment when I saw some very strange red glowing lights going past the window.  The apartment is on the second floor with no other buildings obstructing the view from this window, so the object was possibly 1/2 mile to 1 mile away and quite high in the sky. I saw one light, then two, then a third in a triangle formation that was spread out length-wise.  I first thought it was a blimp, but that made no sense as there were no games going on that night in LA that I was aware of. I went to the window and the lights started to spread out more.  One went higher, the other went further away and the third one kept drifting ahead on its original course.  The one that rose higher came more toward us.  We turned off the TV and heard no helicopter rotors.  There were no spotlights either, which would be expected if they were choppers flying in formation like that.  There were no blinking lights... not police lights or anything news choppers would have had.  They were just glowing red dots in the sky that were moving slowly along. Two of them flew out of sight because trees closer to us obscured them.  But the third one just seemed to be there for a moment, then we looked away for a second to get a phone to try filming them and when we looked again, the 3rd object had vanished, even though it had been moving very slowly and was in the open sky with no trees to slip behind anywhere near it. Very strange indeed.  Neither of us had any logical explanation for what we\u2019d seen.  We kept watch for a few minutes longer, but the objects never returned. No reports of this in the Los Angeles news today or on the internet anywhere.  Would love to know if anyone else saw this.",

The light from the moon highlighted some of the clouds as they sailed past it.  Through the telescope I observed what looked like a large rectangular white \"shelf\" moving up and down, in and out of a thick cloud.  It appeared to be billowing clouds out of itself. Creating them.  I watched it for roughly 10-15 seconds before it left the scopes field of vision and I could not locate it again, mainly because I have limited sky vision due to surrounding trees.

This, of course, was impossible.  I pointed it out to my brother and then I saw it move...and I said \"Ah, must be a plane\".  It continued for a few seconds on it's path and then stopped.  And then I said \"Ummm, that's not a plane\".  It was a white dot, basically.  Way too high up to be a helicopter, and I don't know of any aircraft that can go that high and come to a stand-still.  At this point we were fixated. Suddenly - and I mean out of nowhere - two other dots appeared and seemed to fly in formation for a few seconds.  The 1st one we had seen starting moving again and then changed course in a highly dramatic way - as in \"right angles\".  The dots would appear and disappear.  I then yelled over to my neighbor, who arrived with another adult friend and 2 children.  We ALL saw these things.  I grabbed my camera and filmed for a few seconds, capturing one of them on film (albeit just a white dot in a blue sky).  On the audio track of it you can hear one of the kids getting scared, another kid saying \"oooh i see them!\".  I called Andrews AFB and they ref'd me here.  (I told the guy \"Look, I'm not a UFO guy, but if you just look out your window towards the moon you'll see what I mean!\". I also called the air traffic control tower and the Dept. of Homeland Security at LAX and got answering machines.  Go team!  I have no idea what to suggest from this. By definition, they were UFO's. I have zero affiliation with anything having to do with UFO's, this was just a crazy thing that 6 of us saw and I wanted to make a record of it here in case it helps.

It was somewhat hard to determine what the craft were as they were coming towards my location so at times it appeared as though they were craft coming towards me, and because of this viewing angle, it also appeared as thought someone may have simply let go of some circular balloons that were floating \"up\" and may just be reflecting city lights from below (as objects at a constant altitude that are approaching you in the sky also appear to be moving \"up\").   Once the objects moved much closer I was able to determine that the! y were not balloons floating up but were indeed a formation of 4 separate objects flying from west to east directly overhead.  The craft flew directly overhead at what appeared to be considerable altitude (it's extremely difficult to judge, but I would estimate anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 feet in altitude.  It was very difficult to determine the shape of the craft, as it was night time, but the craft appeared to have lights on the bottom that either outlined a somewhat circular shape or would \"move\" in such a way as to be consistent with a circular TV screen with various pixels turning on and off.  They were clearly all separate craft as they flew in loose formation and changed position in relation to one another, but generally maintained a somewhat traditional formation consistent with a group of aircraft (i.e. all moving in the same directly with somewhat equal spacing, with the space between the craft roughly 5-10 times the length of each craft).   They appeared to move generally in a straight line at a speed consistent with a highe r flying jet or a lower flying helicopter, yet the shape of the objects was neither of these things, and the light patterns of each were slightly different.  The light patterns almost appeared reminiscent of the large TV type display contained on the side of the Goodyear blimp, yet much more dimly lit.  One craft appear to be completely constantly lit in a circular shape.  The center was dark with increasing light towards the edges and slight color variation moving form center to edge.   The other craft shared this same general characteristic and color pattern, but the \"lights\" themselves were not steady state (i.e. the entire circle was not always \"lit up\" at one time).  One craft was lit in such a way as it looked light a two bladed helicopter rotor slowly spinning and fading a trail of fading light behind it (i.e. one line drawn across a circle that rotated and cast a fading trail behind).  This appeared to rotate at a speed of roughly once every 3-5 seconds ! (i.e. MUCH slower than a helicopter rotor system).  This object was the third in line.   The 4th object had a light patter which appeared to be a somewhat loosely drawn triangle which seemed to constantly \"morph\" and change position and shape within the context of the larger circle (like a screen saver on a computer screen).  The objects did not appear to make any noise, however this is not unusual of aircraft in the area as the wind, distance, and city noise can easily drown out aircraft noise. I am a helicopter and jet pilot with 14+ years of flying experience and do not believe these craft to be civilian helicopters or airplanes. I had a substantial amount of time to observe these craft (several minutes?) and attempted to take photo with my iPhone, however given the distance and the night time, I was not able to get a quality photo (again, to be expected given the conditions and equipment used). After the craft had passed overhead, and while they were still in plain view towards the east of my location, I called the Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), 858-537-5900, and asked if they were tracking any formation of aircraft in the area.  The controller initially said they often routed \"downwind\" traffic for LAX over my location.   I indicated that the objects I was referring to were not downwind airliners headed to LAX, but rather were a group of 4 strange objects which now appeared to be well east (perhaps over fullerton airport) and were continuing to travel east bound.   TRACON employees indicated that they were not tracking any objects in that area, and said they were \"Looking at the radar right now,\" and did not see anything that fit this description or any other unusual traffic or radar targets. The objects continued to move east and eventually faded from view (as any aircraft would).",

      "story": "Seven to Eight Mysterious High Altitude Objects Moving in Formation Overhead in Southern California This sighting occurred during one of my frequent weekend hikes up the Verdugo Mountains.   After reaching on of the the peaks,(an altitude of 2940 feet), I reclined to rest on a concrete platform near one of the newly constructed transmission towers, I witnessed four \"extremely high altitude\" white circular objects.  They \"appeared\" rather than \"approached\" as would be the case with any traditional aircraft.  These objects were not unlike a satellite in size but unlike a satellite they did not move across the sky at the expected speed.  They hovered and moved very slowly in a more or less linear formation in the direction of Palmdale and Lancaster.  These objects seemed to leap frog one another at times, appearing and reappearing.  They eventually moved out of sight. Five or ten minutes later, my interest peaked, three more objects appeared very near the same position, directly above me.  Similarly, the three objects were small white circular lights hovering at an extremely high altitude.   One of the lights was flashing, reflecting light back, unlike any of the other lights previously observed.  I interpreted this as the one object to be rotating with a reflective surface. Like the other objects, these three moved away slowly and eventually out of sight. As I observed these truly unusual objects I had plenty of time to consider the possible explanations.  I ruled out conventional aircraft.  These things were hovering. They moved much too slow and were at too high an altitude.  I ruled out satellites.  They were too close to one another and satellites don't just \"appear\" and they don't move in mass formations.  I ruled out stars.  Duh.  I could not, however, completely ruled out high altitude weather balloons of some kind.  They were not any sort of balloons I'm aware of at the least.  If they were balloons, they were huge and moving in formation with one another and one was flashing or reflecting light. With Edwards AFB so close, I am guessing these things were military in origin.  The funny thing is that moments before I saw them I said to myself I wonder if I'm going to see any UFO's this time, and sure enough there they were.   Pretty cool and interesting sighting for me.  I'll never forget it.  I just wish I had a telescope with me!",

      "story": "A star like object, flashing red and blue as well as glimmering, in a west-southwest direction in Los Angeles. It was about 9PM in Los Angeles, I was walking to my car up the street to get something out of it, and I looked up in the west-southwest direction and saw what looked like a star, except I could see that it was glinting or glimmering, and very obviously turning blue and red. I live under a flight path, so I've seen a lot of airplanes above my house and coming in from the distance, but this looked much higher and farther away than they usually are.  I then thought it might be a police helicopter, because of the presence of red and blue lights and the fact that it wasn't moving, but again, it was so high and so far away,  I've never seen a helicopter that high up before.  If it was a police helicopter, it was extremely high and definitely over the ocean. I continued to watch from my apartment balcony for approximately 45 minutes. The only movement from the light was that it very, very slowly traveled down toward the horizon.  I only noticed this movement because I could tell that it was in a different position relative to the top of an electric pole than when I first started watching it.  This is also how I could tell that it wasn't a star, because none of the other stars in the sky had moved that much since I had begun watching. I filmed it on my small digital camera that I have. It's very poor quality, but you can plainly see that the object is flashing red and blue (and maybe other colors too).  I notice that you don't have an option to send video, so I've uploaded my poor quality video here:  http://youtu.be/haWsy8exV24  (I removed audio because I was on the phone while filming). Again, it was glimmering or glinting as well as flashing red and blue, sort of from one side of the object to the other, while maintaining a consistent bright white light as well. I want to say that I saw it slightly wiggle around or move slightly in its immediate area, but that could have been my eyes playing tricks on me. I watched it until it went behind the hill that was blocking my view, and I'm not sure how much longer it was there for after that.  I've done some research online and can't find anyone else who had seen it. Thank you.",

      "story": "Two faint bluish-white lights streak in a slightly wobbly way under the lunar eclipse over LA. I was looking up at the closing stages of the lunar eclipse with two companions who were speaking and not paying attention when I suddenly noticed two faint but distinct bluish-white lights streaking across the sky just a few degrees below the moon. From my vantage point in the Hollywood area the eclipse was taking place in the sky south from us at a high, approximately 75 or so degree angle.  We stood next to the base of a one story building, which took up two-thirds of the view of the southern sky.  The eclipse took place a few degrees above the tiles of the roof, and just a few degrees below a cable tv wire.  The objects streaked through this view within these narrow sky boundaries.  They moved in a 10:00 o'clock to 4 o'clock path at a rate of speed fast enough to span this space in just a few seconds. I began tracking the one on the left, which seemed slightly brighter while it also trailed one that I only barely perceived that was almost immediately below the line of sight due to the roof. I was able to view it for only 3 seconds before it too was blocked by the roof.  It took place as the haze of the marine cloud layer was passing over the city, and the haze was backlit somewhat by the moon making the observation attempts by my friends very challenging in the brief moment they had to respond to me. I immediately tried to understand what the two lights were since they were not flying in a straight line despite having a velocity similar to shooting stars.  The precise movement of the lead one on the right couldn't be observed but I clearly saw the one on the left have subtle shifts and wobble-like movements as it rapidly traversed my line of sight and miles of the sky in those short moments.

From my backyard in northeast Los Angeles, at approximately 5:18 pm on November 24, 2014, I looked toward the western horizon after sunset.

The apparent size of the lights was comparable to the apparent size of a star. The lights moved in a steady fashion and in a slow apparent speed.  They moved forward as if flying side by side from one another (instead of in a line, trailing each other).  The red lights were approximately 15 degrees apart from my vantage point. The distance between the lights did not change during my observation.  The lights blinked in a definite pattern which did not change (left-left.\u2026.right-left-right-right\u2026\u2026..left-left\u2026.right-left-right-right\u2026..in rapid succession.)  The two blinking red lights moved slowly north and then continued off to the northwest until no longer visible at approximately 5:26pm.  There was no sound associated with the lights as far as I can tell. The relative positions of the lights as they moved gave me the impression that I was witnessing a massive winged aircraft flying silently in the sky, with each blinking red light located at the end of each wing.   However, no aircraft (spacecraft?) assembly was discernable between the two blinking lights.  No other lights were associated with my observation, such as the constant glow of green and red lights one normally sees in civilian aircraft.

I don't know if this is related, but 2 hours later near Santa Monica Airport, I witnessed 3 black helicopters and 2 black Osprey/VTOLs ((deleted--flying)) towards the coast",

Then all at the same time the lights went out all over the area, my phone went dead, and the owner of our buildings car went dead and at that same moment there was a giant very bright light came over me and the apt. owner, and it was so bright you could see the veins of the ivy plant leaves!    The apt. owner looked out her window up into the light and then at me and she kept on trying to start her car, then I looked up to see where the light was coming from and all I could see was a circle of clear blue sky, then everything came back on at the same time and the light went off!   The next day the owner said do not tell anyone, they will not believe us!  She worked at a local hospital, and she was a doctor!  I at that time was a stay home mother!   I have had 6 encounters through my life, this was one of them, at the same apt.  I got up a few years later to go to the bathroom and there was an alien in the bathroom, I seem to know her!  I asked her if I could touch her and she let me touch her hand to be sure she was real!  The same alien was out here in the desert around 20 years ago and she informed me that they are not from another planet, that they are from our future 25 thousand years from now, that we could not find any life on any other planet so we found a way to use time travel and we changed our dna!   The first time we were living out in a desert and they came to our car and took us out after my mother went crazy over what was happening to us, they were all white and glowing, we hovered over the desert floor, we were taken into a foggy yellow whitish fog and the next day we were back in the car and my sister tried to tell our parents what had happened and my step dad asked her to point to where they took us and as she did a cactus came up from the ground and went through her hand and all we did was try to remove the needles !!Now this was around 1951 or 52!

I looked up to admire the beautiful weather and the clear sky.   I noticed a group of seagulls flying in formation.  They passed, then three seagulls remained flying in the air without the rest of the group.   As I continued to watch the birds I kept thinking my mind was playing tricks on me due to the height of the birds.  They seemed to be flying higher and higher in the sky with a swirl type motion without flapping their wings.  Then the more I looked at the birds, the wings seemed to morph into their bodies.   I was only able to focus on one bird as they appeared smaller.  It got smaller and smaller then turned into a white dot in the sky.   The next thing that happened is that it started to glow a white bright light.   Then, lastly, it turned into a tiny, red, glowing dot in the sky.  It was the size of a tiny star in the sky, but glowing red in broad daylight in a clear blue sky.   It was the most bizarre thing I think I ever witnessed.   Basically, I saw a seagull turn into a glowing orb.   The best part about it was I caught it on my iPhone.  It is very hard to see.

We watched it diagonally come across the sky near the crescent Moon, and from the same direction, we saw a zig-zagging object coming across on the same trajectory, changing colors, traveling faster than the ISS. I called my husband's attention to the 2nd object and said, \"That UFO is trying to catch up to the Space Station!\"  By the time the ISS was slightly S/E of our deck, indeed, the zig-zagging object did catch up with and surpass the ISS. When the 2nd object was slightly ahead of the ISS, the object slowed down and kept pace with the speed of the ISS, slightly ahead of the ISS.  The objects were approximately the same size, and the UFO was still zig-zagging back and forth just ahead of the space station, changing colors as it winked out in between the zig-zags.   As we watched both objects disappear over the ridge to the east of our house, they appeared to be about a dime (held at arm's length) apart.",

The sky was already dark as sunset in Los Angeles was at 4:55pm.  I happened to look to the west when I saw a bright white light. The object was approximately 50 degrees above the southwest horizon.   Emanating from the point of white light was an area of illumination resembling a cone, with the tip of the cone at the light and the bottom part of the cone shining to the east toward me.  The cone of diffuse light was approximately 10 degrees in length.  This cone shaped area of illumination seemed to consist of light reflecting off air particles, similar to the way a flashlight shows a shaft of light when shined into a dusty sky.   There was no noise associated with the light.  The object and its cone-shaped shaft of light remained stationary for a minute or two.  Then the object moved to the north very slowly until it was due west of me.  Behind the white light (extending south of the light) appeared an area of blue glow approximately 10 degrees in diameter.  The area of blue glow was diffuse and somewhat oval shaped, like a diffuse cloud.  The blue glow was pronounced at first, but slowly began to grow dim.  At this point the white cone-shaped shaft of light that had been emanating from the white point of light had disappeared.  The white point of light grew dim but still traveled northward very slowly.   The diffuse, dim blue \u201ccloud\u201d remained for approximately 10 minutes and then gradually faded.   The white point of light also faded away as it traveled slowly in a northward direction.  This may have been a rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force base north of Los Angeles.  However, I am not sure and so decided to issue this report.  I have witnessed a few Vandenberg rocket launches from Los Angeles in the past.   This object, whatever it was, looked nothing like those previous launches. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD))",

I was in the passenger seat and suddenly noticed two black triangular craft perhaps 1,000 feet up  and a bit to the south (to my right seen through the passenger window which was rolled down). Initially I thought that they were stealth aircraft, but what struck me later is that I didn't hear the sound of jet engines.  My friend and I may have had the radio on, but it wasn't loud because I distinctly recall interrupting him in the middle of a conversation to point out the objects.  They were also flying very close to one another.  From my vantage point, they seemed to be almost touching.  I don't recall any specific physical details apart from the basic triangular shape. The craft were heading east and moved forward into a position where my friend could also see them through the windshield.  Suddenly they seemed to accelerate and within a few seconds (less than 5) they were gone.  It was a clear day and we saw them disappear over the mountains to the northeast.",

Observance occurred while sitting in the outdoor patio area of the LOS ANGELES MUSIC CENTER COMPLEX at approximately 6:00pm.  I was facing east and  observed two normal commercial flight patterns.  One was a quad-jet jumbo at a fairly high altitude, probably  enroute to Europe.  The others were  a series of aircraft doing their normal circle around downtown Los Angeles on their final approach to LAX.  I think these are somewhere about 6,000 feet or so. At one point I notice something in the sky near the \u201cwhispy\u201d light cloud cover. My first reaction was to questions the flight pattern.  It was not a normal LAX approach nor was it an approach to Santa Monica Airport which normally occurs further north.  The object initially appeared to have alternating right and left side lights, somewhat similar to landing lights on commercial aircraft landing at night.   As it traveled further west, I realized that they were not lights but seemed to be the sun reflecting off of some sort of metallic panels on either side of a vertical  cigar-shaped object.  I brought the object to the attention of my friend.  His first reaction was that it was definitely not an airplane nor helicopter, as its appearance was not in coordination with either of these type of air vehicles. I continued to watch the object for about a minute or so. I was then distracted with the screaming of young children in the area.  I went back to look at the sky and the object was gone.  I continued to scan the sky, but never saw it again.",

      "story": "Red & green lights above the Hollywood Bowl I took a trip from Boston, MA to Los Angeles, CA  8/13-23, 2015 and stayed with my friend in Sherman Oaks. He had tickets to attend the Hollywood Bowl Friday 8/21 to see the rock band Heart. We arrived around 6:30pm and sat at his box seats in the garden section in time to eat our picnic dinner before the 8pm showtime. Just before 8pm I was looking around because I have only been to the Hollywood Bowl once before and I was excited to be there again. Behind me was a half moon in the SSW sky. By now the sky was dark but it was a clear night and the weather was perfect. A bit cool but I was comfortable wearing a sweatshirt and long pants. Just before the show began I happened to look up. There were Klieg lights crisscrossed right above the stage where they intersected creating a giant \"X\". My eyes followed them to where they met above in a crystal clear sky and I was amazed to see this UFO!  It was right above the \"X\" of lights and stationary. I could clearly see two round red lights to the right and two round green lights to the left. I could not see a craft but I felt the lights were part of the same structure. It was about the size of my thumbnail held at arms length. I was amazed. It was so obvious that I wondered if anyone else saw it. By 8pm the Hollywood Bowl conductor Thomas Wilkins took the stage and led us in the National Anthem. Afterwards he introduced the first act before they took the stage. I could not keep my eyes off this UFO. I wanted to watch the show but could not help looking up. Then it dawned on me to take some video with my iPhone 5c. I lined up the image and hit record. This is when I recorded the first video at 8:07pm. I recorded the second video at 8:08 which was zoomed in to the lights and gives you a good idea of how it looked. Since it was shot with an iPhone at night it is a bit blurry. I have submitted two very short videos of the object as well as a still shot. You can hear the conductor in the background speaking to the audience in the videos. The unusual thing for me was that I was sure I recorded at least 10 minutes of video but when I looked later I realized I only captured less than 20 seconds between the two videos. I use video all the time so I was very surprised this happened. I must say I was VERY excited because I have seen UFO's in CA before but they were not this impressive. I almost felt as if this thing was watching us. I must admit I was also a bit nervous and tried to pass the lights off as a drone or balloon yet it was neither one of those. It was stationary most of the time right above my head, facing North about halfway up the sky. Because It was above me I had to strain my neck to watch it sitting there. After a while my neck hurt so I began watching the show instead. When I looked back up again I was surprised to see it gone! I searched the sky and saw it moving toward the NNW horizon. It was moving rather fast but as I watched it, it stopped, again I felt it knew I saw it. I got goose bumps. This is when I thought I recorded another 10 minutes of it. Just below the lights in the WNW are large trees and through the trees I saw a strobe light flashing on & off. I thought it odd but it could be manmade, the object was heading in that direction. After about 10 more minutes it fell behind the trees and that was the last I saw of it. It was in the sky for about 45 minutes!  I feel it was too large to be a drone and the fact that it stopped and started on it's own would rule out a balloon. Also the eerie feeling I got watching it watching me was uncanny. There was a sellout crowd at the Bowl that night and I wonder if anyone else saw what I recorded. I went on the internet to see if anyone had posted anything on Youtube and found this video which is very close to what I saw. It also was shot in CA so maybe what I saw was indeed a UFO. You can watch that video here http://youtu.be/JRr3bFWfO6o  Thank you for your time.",

I cannot remember the exact date and time there for I say circa 1994.  I was about 13 years of age when my father and I witnessed this sighting but I remember it very well.  I have never reported this before, and I don\u2019t know why I am doing it now, especially after so many years. The day was already dark, so I believe it must have been between the hours of 6pm-8pm when my father called my name and said, \u201cCome outside and take a look at this.\u201d  I came outside to our apartment\u2019s balcony and my father had his camcorder setup with his tripod facing towards the sky.  He say\u2019s look at that while pointing to the sky, I said, \"Yeah, it\u2019s a big star, he smiles and say\u2019s wait, pay attention.   We both start looking at the same object which looked like a blue star, when suddenly, it explodes just like a firework when all the lights expand with no noise and disappear.  After it would disappear, several seconds later, all lights would come back together as if you would push rewind and watch it being put back together forming the Orb again, it repeated this several times.  It was weird; it was if the orb was exploding (pulsing) out these blue lights just like a firework.   This thing whatever it was would suddenly move hundreds of feet in an instant.  It would move in any direction up, down, left right, it was crazy and amazing at the same time.  We didn\u2019t know what we were looking at but we were not scared.  It did the moving and exploding around several times until it just shot up into the sky at an incredible speed looking like a shooting star leaving the earth.   This was the first of many sightings I have had.  I assure you this is no hoax and I have nothing to gain of this.  I have never heard anyone else having a similar sighting as this.  I don\u2019t know why I have seen so many UFO\u2019s after my first sighting.  I leave you with good news and bad news.  The good news is my father recorded the whole thing.  The bad news is he cannot find the dam VHS tape.  Whatever we saw, was very real.

The lights flashed intermittently and independently, and the object itself seemed to be just hanging in the clear blue sky about 45 degrees above the horizon.   I managed to take a few pictures with my Canon PowerShot SX20 IS camera, and then lost sight of it as we turned a corner.  I am not sure what direction the object was in. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Thank you for your message, and I did submit a detailed report to NUFORC yesterday. If you're unable to find it, I can resubmit it. To summarize, I spotted this while riding as a passenger in a car with two other witnesses, and the sighting lasted about 5 minutes.  I think we were on or near Venice Boulevard when I saw it, then I lost sight of it as we turned a corner.  It was about 45 degrees above the horizon, and there was no sound.  Two gold-colored flashing lights emitted from it intermittently and independently from each other.  One light was near the top of the object, and the other light was near its bottom. It if weren't for these lights I would probably not have noticed it.  The object was stationary. Regards, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

I was taking photographs of the airplanes taking off and landing with my Canon EOS 80D camera as a hobby. I did not realize until getting home that evening and uploading the pictures from the camera onto my laptop that I took a picture of a possible UFO at the top left of the control tower at 7:14 p.m. PST that evening, because I was focusing solely on the planes at that time. I took 139 shots from that location that day, and the object showed up in only one shot.  It looked like a round black metal ball with a ring/protrusion in the middle.

My fianc\u00e9 and I saw a craft on a perfect sunny and clear Sunday afternoon that we have failed to find any information on it, and wonder if you can help give us an understanding as to what it was. The craft was a flat metallic grey sphere about thiry-five to forty feet in diameter.  It appeared to be unpolished titanium, had no windows, no lights, and was completely silent.  It traveled at a constant speed, about the speed of a fast moving Bell Jet Ranger, which we see a lot of here, so approximately 140-150mph,  When I first saw it I thought it was a helicopter but I couldn't see any blades.  I pointed it out to my other half, and we looked at it as it came right towards us.  It was flying at no more than 1500ft, and at a constant speed, passing by in total silence at around 150mph.  At its closest it was no more than 1/8-1/4 mile from us.  It was a perfect blue sky LA afternoon with low afternoon autumn sun perfectly illuminating it, so it was absolutely clear what it was. We live on the Santa Monica Mountains with a very open 180\u00ba panoramic view out over the entire LA Basin, and this craft quite literally flew along Sunset Boulevard.  For days after the event we searched the internet to see if there were any other reports of it, but found nothing. What neither of us can understand is how a craft can fly through such a densely populated area and be completely unreported.",

      "story": "Copper-colored metallic disc sighted over downtown Los Angeles I was returning to work on the 110 freeway heading north. Traffic was moving slowly due to a recent downpour.  At the edge of downtown Los Angeles near the Convention center, I noticed a metallic, copper-colored object that appeared to be floating along.  It was a couple of hundred feet up and a bit west of the roadway.  I assumed it was a mylar balloon because it looked like it was drifting along in the wind.   As it passed over the freeway and I could see it juxtaposed with one of the skyscrapers, I realized that it was quite large \u2013 easily the size of an average car.  At first I thought it was spherical, but then it seemed to rotate and I could see that it was saucer-shaped. The object continued heading east and moved out view.  I assume other people saw it, but I was alone in my own car.",

Looking straight out of our porch, (looking East-Southeast) in the distance, we saw a sliver of light, much like the moon coming through the clouds.  It was a bright yellowish orange color.   I could not say how far away it was, but it was definitely farther than a mile, if not more than that.  I pointed it out, and she thought it was the moon.   We continued to watch as the object got wider (to about the width of your thumb at arm's length).   There were clouds off in the distance, but no clouds that appeared thick enough to hide the moon.  It maintained a fairly symmetrical shape.  It almost looked like the \"angel decoy\" flare release from an AC-130 gunship, except if these were flares, they didn't fall, and it looked like a solid object.  The object would periodically appear to change size, and hue/brightness, shrinking to a small point, but it was seen to grow in size again, at least once.   Eventually, another object of similar color appeared next to the first (or appeared to split off from the first).   We continued watching and eventually went in, as the object was moving to the left and became obscured by trees and houses in the neighborhood.  We did not hear any sound, but the object appeared to be fairly distant.  I was able to get several (grainy) videos with my iPhone 6 Plus.   Please contact me if you would like to see these videos.",

I have lived in the top floor of an Apartment Building I own in Echo Park for 15 years with full views of downtown L.A. and I see helicopters and planes flying all the time. Today, from the distance in broad daylight, I saw what I thought from afar was a helicopter but moving so fast.  I kept watching it as I never knew a Helicopter could fly that fast and in just a few seconds it got to just above my house and I could see it was a round circular, stainless steel looking object.  My sister was with me watching and said \"maybe its a drone\"  It was too fast for a drone and round solid stainless. I looked on the internet to see if anyone else saw it and I came across this article and the object I saw looked just like this reported in broad daylight in 2017:   https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/851194/UFO-aliens-police-helicopter-Los-Angeles",

Cannot recall exactly what was appended underneath but the object had a main, large, spherical, shiny body and then a second component below it.  It was not nylon or a tether hanging from it; I don't think it was a weather balloon.   We flew by it so fast that I did not take a photo of it and it struck me as incredibly odd, and very dangerous, considering that it was directly in the flight path to LAX, and at the same altitude as the 777 that we were in.",

I was in my room looking out my window, north, aircraft were coming in on final approach to LAX. Right to left.  The sun was bright to my right from the east. It had rained in the early morning and my window was littered with droplets.  Off to the west over the channel about 2 miles away, there were clouds with frequent breaks to blue sky.  I was scanning the sky for any anomaly that didn\u2019t fit the normal airport traffic.  Hoping to spot something before going home.  So, was it my imagination or did it really happen?   As I looked at one particular blue patch in the clouds, I noticed a short yellow streak of light ascending at about 30 degrees from right to left (north to south) could have been several miles away and 3-8,000 feet altitude.   I was focused on that spot and then I saw another and another in the space of about 2 seconds there must have been maybe 10 separate streaks in the same location close to each other but occurring separately.  I thought hmmm, probably weather anomaly or some kind of refraction from the rain drops,  I went to finish packing to go to catch my flight.   About 8:30, just before leaving my room, I took another look in the same general area and as I looked, I saw a streak just like before only this time for the period of maybe a minute, I only saw the one.  Seemed weird, but maybe I saw an exodus of a few UFO\u2019s. it was too far away to make out any craft, only the streaks.  Hmmm",

It was about 5 AM around May 1997.  I was walking to Griffith Park to do my morning work out.  As I was going west down Franklin Ave., I noticed (how could I not notice it, it was HUGE) a large very bright egg-shaped object slowly going across the horizon at about 15 or 20 degrees.  As it moved from behind some trees I was surprised at how large it was.  As it continued across the open space between the trees and the houses on the other side of the street it came into complete view and I could see the whole object.  (Did I say it was HUGE?)  As it continued to move past I could see the rear of the object and saw sparks sputtering out of it.  When it got to the other side of the street, it disappeared, and I didn't see it after that.  One of the things I thought was interesting was that the light coming off of the object, as bright as it was, didn't throw shadows and there was no sound. I was teaching at the East Los Angeles College South Gate Campus at the time.  About a week later one of my students came to me and apologized for coming in late to the class lately. He said he had the midnight shift at LAX.  I asked him, \"Were you working last Thursday?\" He said, \"Yes.\"  Then, I asked \"Did you happen to see any...?\"  That's all I got out.  In a surprised voice he said, \"We ALL saw it.  We said, 'What the **** us that?'  It was way out over the ocean.\"  Interesting when an object is verified by others from a different perspective.  LAMUFON may still have the report in their files.  The picture of what I saw was in the report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I saw an arrowhead-shaped (triangular) craft at 6:30-ish p.m. Sept. 10, 2019, while driving home from my office in Los Angeles.  I was stopped in the left-hand turn lane on Sixth Street at Alvarado, facing east.  On my right was the corner of MacArthur Park. On the left was a Bank of America.  The object was about 150 to 200 yards away, hovering above the street on the north side, about 4 or 5 stories up.  It rose about 10 feet, banked up and to the left (north) and went behind a building.  It was about the size of a small car (judging from where the building sits on Sixth Street).  The back of it was black and had two bright lights.  The top, as it banked, appeared to be black down the center, and either side of that swath was midnight blue.  It was metallic because as it banked, it reflected the sunlight (sun was behind me, in the west).  There were no propellers and no wings. That\u2019s what made me feel it wasn\u2019t a drone.  The next day, I called two of the LAPD\u2019s Ramp! art station non-emergency numbers.  I never got a human to pick up the phone.  I left my name and number and told them only that I\u2019d witnessed something and wanted to know if anyone else had phoned in. I also phoned the Bank of America, which has a security camera on its overhang on the corner of Sixth and Alvarado \u2014 four times.  I wanted to know if someone on their security staff would look at footage from that evening. I know within about a 5-minute window when I saw this.  Not only did I never get a human to pick up the phone, the bank doesn\u2019t even let you leave a message.  I am also sure the Rampart station has security cameras, too.  I saw the object for only about 3 or 4 seconds but I saw it as plainly as I saw cars on the street.",

It was breathing kinda heavily seemed as if was under some type of stress but I felt the feeling of comfort there was no harm done to me or to It, I felt at peace with my self and the  situation I also told him that I think they\u2019re out there waiting for you . I spoke those words and it never replied it just kept staring at me.  It had an object in its right hand that looked like some type of shades or sunglasses very thin about half an inch or an inch with length is about a foot or less at 11 inches I was kind of in an fully stretched open position my eyes became attached to it and became curious never said anything, it noticed  that I was interested in what he had in his hand and he gave it to me, he just put his hand out and give it to me.  I mediately knew where it went I put it on my eyes and it seems to disappear into my face as I looked around the entire apartment everything seems crystal clear I was amazed at what I was seeig half round side everywhere as I did that disappeared and I saw him again in dreams, dreams that I\u2019ve had a whole bunch of dreams of different  locations in the aircraft in rooms that look like refrigerators steaming  cold air,  places with weird looking trees very dark also very high mountains that they live inside the mountains but very beautiful inside, some other type of being showing me around, weird looking animals birds and other types of beings  how were very family and didn\u2019t attempt to cause harm to me .",

But I kept snapping anyway.  Finally I was able see the contrail in my camera.  I got some pretty good photos of the contrail.  I was certainly surprised to see the missile go completely across the sky because I wanted to take some photos of the separations of the tanks. Well, to make a long story short (too late now), I came to my apartment which was right across the street from where I was snapping the pictures.  I hooked up the camera to the computer and began looking at the photos I got.  I noticed nothing but sky on several initial photos.  But when I looked at this one my jaw dropped.  I saw these 9 very clear dots of light that appeared to be near the path of the rocket.   I checked the photos after that one and the dots didn't appear.

I looked up and noticed that it came on again but not in line to where it appeared to be going. It slowly flashed again and this time it was at another location. This flashing and zig zagging went on until it was hidden behind trees. It was going in a direction (SW) but kept flashing and zig zagging along. It appeared to be rather high (maybe several thousand feet) and made no sound. I wondered if it may have been the Astra jumping?",

From my patio I saw a craft with bright read and green flashing lights in the Northwest sky over Malibu, CA mayber 20 miles away from me,  The craft flew from west to east.  The object moves very fast. it stopped hovered and flew west toward the ocean . It stopped hovered and flew east again.  I am guessing the distance was maybe 20 - 25 miles. I saw the craft fly back and forth maybe 6 times before going back to bed.  The craft stopped on a dine and moved int he opposite direction. It WAS NOT and airplane, drone, or helicopter. I believe that it was a our Airforce or Navy testing a anti-gravity free energy craft.  I will also add that there was no sound. At twenty miles away I would have easily heard a fighter jet or helicopter.",

      "story": "Triangular, brightly-lit object above Hollywood, Los Angeles. Hovered before increasing altitude rapidly. My neighbor and I were sitting outside on our balcony having a late-night drink when we both noticed what we initially believed was some kind of drone.  It approached the Hollywood area from the North West and flew in a straight line for about 40 seconds. As it came closer, I noticed that it did not have any navigation lights.  I do not know how big it was as it was difficult to judge as a bright yellowish light emanated from the object. It then hovered over East Hollywood for about 30 seconds. It then started to increase altitude quite rapidly and within about 15 seconds it could no longer be seen by us.  The sky was clear. I have worked with drones and although it appeared to move through the air like one, it definitely did not have navigation lights.  I did not hear any noise coming from it but it was difficult to be precise as to how far it was from where we were sitting.  The sighting was filmed on an iphone.  My neighbor and I are both sane, normal people.  I am a 57-year-old man and own a successful TV production company,  My neighbor is a professional photographer, aged 45.  We had been drinking but were in no way impaired.",
