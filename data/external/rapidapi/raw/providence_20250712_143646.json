I thought it was an airplane at first as it was traveling along the flight paths of other airplanes which I was observing out of boredom (roughly south to north) as if traveling along with them towards Boston (but it was at that time alone in the sky).  However the dim nature of the light-bar, and that it brightened and darkened slowly, without going on or off like typical airplane made me curious.  It reminded me of the behavior of a satellite, but the overcast sky would make that impossible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "large, double beamed spotlight high in the sky Date of sighting: 9/19/09 Approximate time: 8:00 pm Place: Providence, RI (East Side) Direction: in the sky over the highway (I95) While walking to my car with a friend I saw a large, bright light in the sky.  It was clearly a light, not a star, and looked to be the size of a large spotlight with one primary beam coming down.  However, it was partially obscured behind a house, so I did not at first see that, while there was only one \u201clight\u201d, there were in fact two beams coming down.  Also, this light was extremely high in the sky; this was clear by the fact that the length of the light beams, despite coming from an intensely bright light, ended far, far above the ground, what looked like miles from our perspective.  Nothing on the ground was therefore illuminated.   As soon as I rounded the bend and saw these beams, they immediately began to disappear in a strange manner.  Rather than getting smaller and smaller as they ascended, the brightness diminished in a nanosecond; what was left was the \u201cafter light\u201d.  It appeared that the light had perhaps disappeared behind a cloud; however, the night seemed to ! be cloudless, based on the fact that stars were visible (although, due to the density of ground light, there were not many of them).  The \u201cafter light\u201d lasted several seconds as it got dimmer and dimmer; it was clear that the \u201clights\u201d had not been turned off, rather, that whatever they were attached to was ascending rapidly in the sky.  The entire incident last approximately 20 seconds.  It was witnessed by myself and my friend, who saw essentially the same thing (though she did not have as good a view as I did, being more blocked by the house that had at first obscured my full view).",

On Friday, May 14th 2010, around 4:30 am., I saw something quite curious. I am a cab driver and I tend to sit at the same spot early in the morning.  For some time I had been watching what I thought was Venus, rising in the east.  I was informed later that it was probably Jupiter. Anyhow, being the star gazer I am, I have watched this same star, planet, for quite awhile. What made this morning different was the fact that while I was watching it definitely slid approximately 4 inches in my view to the left and then just vanished. It was a clear morning, no clouds.  I waited for it to reappear but it never did in that spot.  10 minutes later or so though, if it is the same star, it did reappear way to the right and a lot higher in the sky. It happened way to fast to capture on video.  Not to mention I just wasn't expecting it. A few weeks later I attempted to make a video of what I saw.  Have link if needed.",

We had just sat down on a park bench behind a building when I saw a falling star (meteor) fall quite brightly, appearing between the building and a tree line to our  left.  I asked my wife if she saw the meteor but she was looking in another direction.  Five seconds after that I saw what appeared to be three diffused light-colored spots (very close together) flying in the exact course the meteor had taken.  This only lasted a second, again my wife did not see this new thing.  While it might have been a bird (or birds) I am curious about the shape and manner in which it flew, but mostly the direction -- right behind the \u2018falling star\u2019.  It seemed to have been at a greater distance than if it had been a bird, possibly a large object of some kind.  This happened near the Providence/Pawtucket line: Rhode Island.

While finishing up I looked up and saw a huge white glowing semi transparent rounded triangle fly at above tree level.  The object was below planes' levels as there were two up high in the sky at the time I noticed.   I jumped up and tried to convince my fiance to look up.  He refused and told me that I looked nuts!   I saw another smaller looking traingle follow after the object and was proceded by two orange/red smaller objects.  At this time my fiance saw the last one and made me go inside.  The first one was incredibly fast and the others were slower.   This is the first time i have ever saw or reported anything like this.  I reported this only because I googled this and found out that everyone else saw it too!   All I can say is, \"What the hell is going on?\"",

      "story": "While walking in Providence, husband and wife and others view 3 orange orbs in the night sky My wife and I were walking along the Providence river on South Water Street on the 27th after attending Waterfire in the city.  We were approximately 100-150 yards away from the bridge where the Waterfire festival ends, near the pavilion next to the river that marks the place where the Gaspee was burned by RI colonists in the early 1770s.  I looked up and noticed a large commercial airliner flying overhead, perhaps approaching TF Green airport in Warwick which was flying fairly low, but that quickly disappeared over the bay and we continued on our walk.  As we were walking north towards the bridge, a group of three younger guys were walking towards us and one said \u201cWhat is that?  UFOs?\u201d  The other guys laughed, but we turned our heads and saw 3 bright orange lights in the sky in a triangular pattern\u2026approx 100-150m high (but could be higher\u2026hard to tell).  They made no noise and as we watched another guy (older who was walking his dog) came along behind us and saw we were looking at something and looked up and said something like \u201cWhat the heck is that?\u201d  We said we had no idea.  Slowly, the color faded from bright orange, almost flamelike to white and the first two dots continued down the river towards the harbor/Narraganset Bay while one stayed suspended for a minute or to (I took a quick video with my iPhone of that one) and then it slowly faded away.  I wanted to blame the appearance on Waterfire, thinking that perhaps they were large embers suspended in the sky but there was no major breeze that would blow these downriver 100-150 yards and they all turned white at the same time.  Finally the one light in the sky faded out and we turned and walked away. This was the 3rd UFO I\u2019ve seen in my life BTW\u2026.but was very strange as it was seen in such a cosmopolitan area, by so many people (the young college aged guys, the dog walker and us), but we were literally only 300-450 feet away from hundreds, perhaps thousands of people.",

They made no noise at all and they weren't that far, whereas I wouldn't hear the noise of a normal type craft.   The formation was not totally straight.  Five of them stopped for approx. 30 seconds and seemed to be observing the fireworks, then they continued to proceed south, they came from the north.  They were not going at a high rate of speed either.  They were at approx. 1 mile apart from each other.   Then as they seemed to disappear into the clouds another one showed up and then two more.  All crafts seemed to disappear into the cloudly sky.   I waited to see if they would reappear for quite a while, but they did not.  They weren't very far in the sky, no where near what a plane would be, yet not one noise was heard even when the fireworks stopped you still couldn't hear a thing.  They also seemed to have a top to the disc shape...it was rounded.  I'm unsure if I was the only one who saw these crafts but I think folks were more interested in the various colors in the sky which the crafts also seemed intereted in too.",

At exactly 11:22:16pm, while I was watching WPRI 12 channel news they cut to a live view facing the cameras East towards the Biltmore and Westin Hotels.  At this time some type of object coming from the North and heading South was flying past at a fairly low altitude but was going at what appears to me as an extremely fast (beyond Hypersonic speeds).  I needed to slow it down and watch it over again (which I did about 20+ times) at about 1/6 of the normal speed and pausing at different times.  I noticed at this 1/6 speed that it was on camera for less than 2-3 seconds total which indicated to me that its speed was unbelievably fast.  Upon watching it over and over again, at different speeds, different time frames etc, it appears to be as best I could make out some type of aircraft (of Unknown origin).  It honestly could have been some type of fighter jet at hypersonic speeds....but why so low? I tried to DVR this and my DVR said it was having \"difficulties at! this time.\" (&lt;--Im not saying there is some conspiracy I am only indicating to you why I couldn't record and save this event).  I would ask for help in getting a copy of this from WPRI channel 12 news of this live broadcast, re-analyzing it, and then possibly contacting TF Greene Airport officially to see if they have record of what, if any, aircraft was flying through there. Unfortunately, yet very awkwardly, is the fact that this airport is approximately 10-15 miles from providence and in the same direction of this probable aircraft, however I do know for a fact that given its speed it was NOT coming in for a landing and it was definitely NOT some plane taking off as I have seen 100's of planes do both of these and this aircraft was flying at extremely High rate of speed that I can't even explain in words.  It almost looks like a streak across the sky like a meteor, but it was not at all bright like one, it didn't \"fizzle out\" like a meteor and it was clo! se by....like right over the city it appears.  The trajectory (! i.e. ang le) of this \"UFO\" is completely inconsistent with a meteor also.  I hope you don't think this is a joke, or just some crazy red neck farmer who had been drinking too much\u2026   I am a highly educated, liberal college professor and Registered Nurse from the Northeast who is 100% sober and yet dumbfounded as to what this could be/is.

Around 5:30 this morning, my husband was out in the back yard with our dog, when he began to shout for me to come outside quickly. I worried something was wrong, so I immediately ran outside, as he pointed to the sky.   About a mile away I saw a very prominent red circle or orb like craft.  There could have been a haze around it but unsure if it was my eyes or not.  The orb was definitive and red though.  I observed it and watched it  in the sky as it was hovering.   Then, it very quickly zinged to the right and stopped again.  It turned from red to white, then back to red.  What I couldn't believe was the way it flew to the side and stopped immediately, not a gradual stop or eased stop, but a full on stop, like it hit a barrier and how fast it was moving.   It hovered a minute, then zinged left stopped, and it appeared to gain some elevation as it slowly proceeded to fly to the right and out of view for a few seconds, when I caught a glimpse of it through the houses.   I then observed it zing up into the sky so fast, I couldn't believe it, and it was gone.   I am a well educated professional and I am telling you there is nothing I have ever seen or heard of that:  1.  Is as precise in stopping as that craft was, it defied physics;  2. Could move that fast, and still maintain such control; and 3.  Could maneuver so quietly, no visible propellers or exterior engines were visible and without any vapor trail or exhaust.   It was scary and intriguing at the same time.  I have no doubt what I saw was not from here.",

At 5:30 AM this morning, I was in my garden with my dog, when I looked up to see a bright red orb moving at great speed. It came to a quick stop, hovered and stayed in the same spot.  It looked to be maybe a mile away but was very distinct in shape and no gas trail or anything surrounding it or following it when it moved. I was unsure what I was witnessing, so I shouted out to my wife to come outside. We then saw the orb move in a straight line to the left,it was moving not as fast as when it first came into view,it then moved quickly to the right,then changed from a bright red glow to a bright white glow then back to red. It then moved left again,and then right,it continued moving right, hovered and then continued as it went out of view. I know some very smart women, and my wife is right up with the best of them. She is a professional lady who has been in high position within her company for several years. When she told me that she had never seen anything move like that in her life, I knew I wasn't crazy!  I myself have never seen anything move as fast,and then stop so quickly in my life. It made no noise whatsoever,but the thing that amazed me is the immediate stopping and acceleration it did.  From a stand still, just hovering, to zipping across in one direction then stopping like it hit a wall, then zipping back in the other direction, multiple times, is impossible to believe.
