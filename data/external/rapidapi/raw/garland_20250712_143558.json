      "story": "I saw a strange bright light in the sky at  a fireworks show and decided to take some pictures. Usually at night in the area I live in I notice a bright light in the sky and think it is a star or satellite or the space station.  From a distance it looks like the light is brighting and fading and turning around, or changing shape so then I think that can't be a star.  I went to the newely built Firewheel Town Center to watch fireworks and noticed one of these similar lights in the sky and thought I would take pictures since the fireworks had not started.  When I took the pictures I had the zoom on my digital camera on all the way.   I was kind of amazed at what I saw when I zoomed into the pictures on word like it was changing shapes.  The sky was pitch black and there was a smaller star looking thing close by.  The fireworks would have been going off infront of where I was and this light was on my right.  A couple of the pictures look like rockets with no light and smoke trail that accidentally maybe a couple of fireworks, but I don't remember.  My background is Navy vet and college student. I know the object could probably be anything, but I thought I would send the pictures.",

A large bright red rectangular object suddenly appeared over the parking lot and hovered a few seconds and then took off flying over our apartment building going east at an incredible (what seemed like super sonic) speed and quickly disappeared. It was very close and appeared to be about 150' long and maybe 50' in width and 50' in height. I was very shaken by this experience and I feel sure that at 7am in the morning there must have been other people who saw this object.",

It was diagonally going down, like it was going to land. It was a VERY overcast day. The craft was dark gray, no lights. I was embarrassed to tell anyone but this website. (see previous entry) I heard no noise, but definitely saw a fluid-like metal object up in the sky for several minutes. It was not a reflection because it kept going down to the left and I was traveling straight ahead down the highway.

My friend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette around 11:00 PM 11/26 and witnessed a light circling around in the sky above my backyard. I also woke my mother up to see it, as well.   At first we thought it may be a spotlight (a new club opening up or something), but the center of the activity was in a strictly residential suburbian area and the light changed its course, moving eradically slow then fast and not in a perfect circle, sometimes a square or triangular course, and small then bigger ellipses, but always clockwise.  We could see no beams coming from the ground either, and the light seemed to be radiating parallel to the ground from an invisible object.  (It seems to beam out some at the right and left sides of the circumference, the course being mostly elliptical.)  It is now after 4:00 am 11/27, and the light is still there circling.   Last I checked I saw other light trailing it.  It was breaking in two at the middle of the course (bottom of ellipse) and then the smaller light followed it to the left and upward.  Kind of like the Atari game \"Breakout\" where it is guided.  Does that make sense?  It moved slow then fast like that.  And, the main light surged, too.  Like I said, it seemed to radiate from a center point above the clouds.   I also saw the light skip and appear further along the circumference immediately several times!  The light is not circular, but hazy (even inbetween the clouds where it is clear sky) and shapeless.  Not like any spotlight I\u2019ve ever seen, and it\u2019s in the middle of the night and has been going on for five hours.  Also, it held it\u2019s position when we went to the front of the house, seemed to be circling over us at the same place as in the backyard.  So, it must have been pretty far away and high up over the clouds.   I hope this makes sense; I\u2019ve tried to give as accurate of a description as possible.  I tried to capture it on camera, but it was too dark to pick anything up (maybe I just don't know how to use the thing!)",

      "date": "2008-08-12T00:00:00",
      "story": "Triangle UFO in Garland, TX in 1992 I\u2019m a college student living in Germany who recently separated as a staff sergeant from the U.S. Army a few months ago.  I am 34 years old.  I hold an associate\u2019s degree.  I am also an expert in long-haul transmissions technology with six years of military experience in the communications field.  Prior to my military service, was in project management for five years with a large telecommunications company.  I lived in and around Garland, Texas, from age 5 until I enlisted at age 28. I apologize, as the date and time of my account is only a guess, as it took place over 15 years ago.  However, I estimated the date based on a few facts: I had recently graduated high school in May 1992; it was summer; I was driving an '87 Honda Civic during the incident, a car which I owned at that time.  The time was late evening, an hour or so after sunset. A childhood friend of mine and I were driving SE down what is today President George Bush Toll Way (TX 190) at around 2200.  Today, the area is very built up with shopping malls and restaurants.  But back in 1992, the only building in the area was a high school (my high school).  It was dark and, at the time, there were no street lamps.  As I'm driving, my friend points to the sky through the windshield and tells me to look.  He's pointing straight up through the windshield to a point directly over my car.  And, while it was difficult for me to lean forward over the steering wheel to see what it was he was pointing at, I caught several glimpses of it.  This is what I saw: three reddish hued lights in a triangle configuration, with one brighter light in the very center of the formation.  And, while the sky was dark, the space between the lights was even darker, giving the shape a distinct triangular outline.  Because I was driving, I could only glance at the object for a few seconds at a time before I had to put my eyes back on the road.  It was difficult to tell whether or not the object was moving along with us, or if it was at such an elevation that it appeared motionless from our perspective.  When I would glimpse it, I could tell the object was rotating slowly in a counter-clockwise direction, at an estimated rate of one rotation every 30 seconds.  We were now approaching a stop sign, and I brought the car to a stop. Without speaking, immediately after I stopped, I shut the engine and lights off; we exited the car and stood up in the road to get an unobstructed view.  To our delight, the object was still there, hovering silently.  Now that we were no longer moving, we could tell the object wasn't moving, either.  It was completely stationary (though it continued to rotate in place) and produced absolutely no noise.  As far as the size of the object, it was difficult to estimate.  But I recall that, from my perspective on the ground, the triangle appeared to be about the same size as the shape one can make by touching the thumbs and index fingers of both hands and holding them at arm's length directly overhead (approximately 4\" x 4\" x 4\"). We continued to watch the object for another thirty seconds or so when another car began to approach us from the rear.  We quickly hopped back in my car, started it up, and pulled it to the side of the road to make way. As soon as the other car pulled away, we got back out.  But when we looked up at the sky, there was nothing there.  Nothing at all.  No noise, no lights.  Whatever we had been observing only seconds earlier had vanished.  I don't recall ever telling anyone about it, and I don't believe my friend or I ever discussed the incident with each other again after that night.  Of course, we haven't spoken to or seen one another in over ten years. I realize it's been many years since this took place.  In fact, I rarely even think about it.  However, it was several years ago that I first read an article or saw a news report about someone witnessing an object matching the exact description of what I'd seen so long ago.  Since then, I've seen or read many other separate but similar accounts.  And, since I've always been somewhat of a skeptic with regards to UFO sightings, I tried my best to pretend what I'd seen must've been something else...maybe something I would've recognized had it been daylight.  However, ever since that day, when I'm outside at night, I still find myself staring up at the sky, semi-hoping that I might see the same thing again, if for no other reason than to prove to myself that whatever I saw actually does exist. Though I still remain skeptical, I felt I should at least contribute my experience so as to at least add my account to the collection of other similar sightings.  Skeptic or not, I saw what I saw.

It had the appearance of previous sightings of shuttle passing overhead on landing approach toward Canaveral.  Lost sight after it passed overhead and moved toward SE.

I live in Garland, Texas only about two miles north of the Dallas city limits and just two blocks east of Garland Road.

I would estimate their speed was less than one hundred miles per hour. One of the objects was trailing the other. I could not make out what shape they had. All I could see was two very bright lights on each object. The color of the lights was red in front and a greenish looking light in the rear of each object. They caught my attention because the lights were very large and very bright. I am very familiar with the size of safety navigational lights on aircraft. These lights were very large and much brighter than safety lights on aircraft. Also the lights did not blink, they stayed on all the time and were very bright. The lights were just above the horizon and they were a good di! stance away. (I would estimate between five and ten miles away) At first I saw them traveling in a north-eastern direction and then they turned left and were traveling in a north-western direction when I lost sight of them as they disappeared behind the trees. I only saw them for a short while, approximately ten to fifteen seconds.  I was in the Air Force for twelve years and am very familiar with aircraft lights.

On April 13th at as close as I can determine at 9:45 pm traveling on George Bush Fwy in the Garland city limits near the intersection of Garland Ave. I saw a line of lights traveling in a semi formation. There were 5 to 6 objects traveling together in a random line at different distances from each other. They were not traveling in a close organized formation but were all traveling together in the same direction coming across in front of my westerly driving direction moving in a line on a North by Northwesterly direction. I pulled the car over and attempted to get my Galaxy S3 out and trained on them to begin videoing. Unfortunately the last setting on my camera had the camera facing me. By the time I adjusted the camera to face away and set to video the objects they had turned a more Westerly direction and moving away from me. The caught my attention as unusual because they appeared to be orange and flickering as a constant light source. They did not have the red and white normal aircraft lights blinking at a consistent way. The light they emitted gave the appearance of a flickering flame. This is barely distinguishable in the video I did get but it is discernible if you know that's what I saw. Unfortunately also my lack of use of the video application on my phone also affected what I got, because it was on when I thought was off, and off when I thought it was on. I did not successfully capture any video on the first line of objects as they moved away. I had been sail racing the whole day so I was well aware the wind was still about 8 to 10 miles per hour coming from the South maybe slightly Southeasterly. The objects seemed to by flying similar to the height and speed of helicopters. So they were very low seeming for aircraft but higher than a typical traffic or police copter, and fairly fast similar to the speed of a fast moving helicopter such as care flight as it would pass over. As I watched the line move away over the city of Plano I turned to get in the car and amazingly another line of objects of the speed, height and constant orange flickering nature were heading directly in my direction. Again there were 5 to 6 or maybe more in the group. They were traveling Southwesterly. This is when I struggled to get my video going again and thought it was on when it was off and off when it was on. As one passed directly over me the underside of one of the objects appeared oval as if the light was refracted as a lens would do. The distinct sound of helicopters was not present as they are obviously very loud and discernible but again this is exactly the height and speed it seemed fast moving high flying helicopters would be moving. It is possible that they could have been larger and higher and just gave the feeling this is the altitude they were flying but I'm pretty certain of my perception. It did seem there was engine noise above the traffic noise but sub! tle and not so obvious. The video I did capture was by accident and you can see the orange flickering effect somewhat out of focus and a couple times focus in and appear white and turn two distinct dots. Visually they never appeared white to me but the video does. The other interesting thing about the colors is that two distinct separate flying objects change color in synchronization. Therefore the color change could be attributed to the low quality camera phone video.. The video I did get was the last one I attempted so it was of the second line moving away from me and probably about already 4 to 5 miles away.

They were all on fire.  I have never seen anything like this before.   I looked it up on line to see if anyone else had seen or reported this but no one had so I thought that I would. Thanks.

At approximately 7:20 p.m. on October 29, 2014, I was at the intersection of North Garland Road and Beltline Road in Garland, Texas.  I was in a parking lot, looking south.  I observed multiple objects emitting a red colored light.  The objects would originate from low on the horizon, and travel from the southeast to the northwest while gaining altitude.  So, from my vantage point, the objects were moving from left to right and upward.  Note that, if these were conventional aircraft, they would have shown a green light, as I was observing the starboard (right) side of the craft.  The objects appeared one or two at a time, and followed the same path as the previous.  I observed several of these red light objects originate low in the horizon and move upward and to the right along the same path in the sky, over the course of approximately 1 minute.  The objects were consistent in size and velocity with conventional aircraft, which were also visible in the sky f! rom my location (urban area) however, as previously mentioned, the coloration of the light was not consistent with conventional aircraft.  The light was reddish in color and had a pulse at a relatively low frequency, also some white light was visible within the red light emitted.  The objects were at a distance such that I was not able to observe their exact shape.  I was unable to detect any sounds from the objects, as the urban area was noisy at that time in the evening.  Also, each of the objects would apparently gain altitude until it appeared as a small pinpoint of light in the sky (star).  Two other witnesses observed the objects after I pointed them out in the sky.",

The AC units would blow warm air out and keep us warm as we hopped from one another till we got home.   Anyway, we are in the pool and I hear what sounds like an AC unit cut on.  I look around and don't see any of the fan's moving..  I don't remember why but I looked up to see 3 bright lights in a triangle formation hovering above us..

I have seen meteors/shooting stars on many occasions and thought no different.  I could distinctly make out \"flames\" on this and thought I had a great view of a meteorite streaking across the evening sky. The \"flames\" diminished and I could see something that looked like a star, moving across the sky. From my vantage point it looked like a star, except that it was moving.  I then saw another \"star\" coming from the other direction, heading South.  This object was perhaps a little brighter than the North-bound \"shooting star\".

It flashed with some intensity almost like a high power strobe flash or led.  It stuck around for close to 2 minutes before the light faded out and then with a larger flash disappeared.  There was no sound, no wind, no visual cause of the light it just seemed to appear with a quite literal flash.

I put my little finger on my right hand over the light to try and gauge its size.  The lights size was that about halve the size of a pencil eraser.  It was very bright and to be honest the closest thing I could compare it too and i know this sound hokey but it's shape reminded me of \"the star of Bethlehem\"...just a big bright light with a four point star look.  I came inside house to grab camcorder and it's battery was dead so i started charging my camera.  I then went to google and googled astronomy events and all i could find was that Jupiter was near waning crescent moon at 1am this morning.  I could find nothing about what I was seeing.  I went back out and watched some more and it was just a big stationary light. At no time did i think this was a Helicopter as I see those all the time with there spot lights on.  Since it was dark I couldnt tell if this was a celestial or terrestrial light...i believe it was celestial.  I came back outside at 1950 and the light is completely gone!! it is just gone...we do have some clouds but I can still see the stars that are much dimmer than this light in the southwest sky.  I have no idea what I saw. I wanted to submit this report in case someone else witnessed the same thing.

Observation:  A \u201cV\u201d shaped pattern of 20 craft moving slowly to the South East.  Through the binoculars I could see that they were Disc shaped and very reflective, I observed them until they crossed the East Mountains and went out of sight.   I turned back North and observed a Very Large jet moving slowly in the same direction, once again, with binoculars, I could see that there were no markings at all, it was pure white, had no windows and made no sound.  While observing the jet, another formation of 20 craft was coming from the north.  I watch as they slowly turned South East in the same direction as the first group and the jet and watched until they too went behind the East Mountains.   The entire event lasted between 5 and 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, no video or camera was available.   Others must have seen this, most of the event was visible to the naked eye.",
