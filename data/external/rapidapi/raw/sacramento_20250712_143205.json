      "story": "In September 1976, I had another UFO encounter.  This time I was out of the Army and living with my former girlfriend H. L. in an apartment.   One night, she came running back inside the apartment screaming.  I asked her what was wrong.  She said that a UFO was hovering 200 feet above her head.  I didn\u2019t see anything.  I noticed she was hysterically crying.   I drove her to the Sacramento Sheriff\u2019s Department and they had her use their phone to call an 800 number to call Dr. Allen Hynek of the Chicago, Illinois Bureau of UFO Investigations.  Dr. Hynek sent us some forms to fill out, so she could describe what she saw.  Dr. Hynek later called me and asked what I was doing.  I told him I was watching \"Dick Van Dyke\u2019s The Comic\" on TV.  He asked what happened when Helen was screaming outside, I said the TV went on the blink, it displayed static and I was trying to fix the TV, when I heard her screaming.  He told me that when UFOs hover nearby, that they cause disturbances on car engines, TVs and radios.  This was a normal occurrence.  Later I learned that 2 other people in Sacramento saw the same UFO in two different locations and it was reported in the Sacramento Bee. From 1979 to 1986 I was back in the U.S. Army.  This time I joined Military Intelligence and I was stationed at PIC-K (Photo Interpretation Center, Korea).  This time my code name was \"Hollywood or Joe Hollywood,\"  I wore a black suit now and I was clean-cut.  I kept the sunglasses though.    My job as a 97 Bravo (Intelligence Analyst) was to work with Image Interpreters in identifying targets in North Korea and Red China, such as T-72 tanks, etc.  I would create what is called a \"sitmap\" pinpointing targets discovered by Image Interpreters, that studied reconnaissance aerial photographs.  I would categorize certain photos.  We would go on what is called a \u2018hot run\u2019 from Seoul, Korea, (Yongsan Barracks) to Osan Air Force Base.  The vehicle would display a placard that indicated that the vehicle could not be stopped for any reason.  There was a combination lock on the trunk of the vehicle and a combination lock in the suitcase inside the trunk,  the driver and myself would have \u00bd of the combination to open the trunk and the suitcase.  We would place the hotrolls (film) into the suitcase and head back to Seoul.   During my time as an Intelligence Analyst I categorized 6 photos taken by reconnaissance satellites of what appeared to be UFOs.  The UFOs moved on their own accord, as if they were guided by some kind of intelligence.  Therefore the 6 photos were significant by Military Intelligence.   The photos moved up the intelligence chain from Military Intelligence to DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) to CIA (Central Intelligence Agency).  From there, I don\u2019t know where the photos went.  While at PIC-K, I worked with Air Force Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, DIA, CIA, Marine Recon, US Army (Green Beret) Special Forces, 101st Airborne, US Army Rangers, 82nd Airborne, Delta Force, Navy Seals.  It was necessary for us to work closely with certain elite military groups.    Another strange photo I once saw was given to me to categorize.  It was a photo of an American POW in Vietnam, taken in 1981.  The photo went into a metallic box with a combination lock and disappeared up the intelligence channel.  The spooks (intelligence personnel) I worked with, would never discuss UFOs.  Most spooks belonged to some sort of secret society, most were Freemasons and I was a Rosicrucian.   When I departed Korea, I signed up for the 82nd  \"Screaming Eagles\" Airborne and Special Forces training and they were ready to send me to Ft. Gordon, Georgia and Ft. Bragg, North Carolina and I was called to do a special assignment.  I received an H identifier and became an Army instructor and taught the Soviet Threat for OPFOR (Opposing Forces).  I wore a Russian uniform, ski mask, black gloves and talked with a fake Russian accent and called myself \"Corporal Dowbowski.\"  I would instruct the Soviet Threat, teaching the W.E.F.T. (Wings, Engine, Fuselage and Tail) on Soviet Aircraft, kill zones on Soviet aircraft and land roaming vehicles, the use of many Soviet weapons from the AK-47 to the SVD Sniper Rifle in which I was proficient.   During my time with OPFOR, I learned from Intelligence circles, that the Russian KGB also knew and were aware of what exactly UFOs were and where they came from. To this day, I don\u2019t know the answers to the UFO mystery, but hopefully one day our Government will disclose what they know to the public.",

Unlike a head light beam. I thought the cloud was causing this affect. After studying it for about a minute trying to justify it in my mind it then moved to the right and stopped. It dimmed and brightened then disappeared. As it disappeared there was a faint round fog or cloud like that which is generated by a high altitude jet engine but very faint. It formed a ball around where the light  pushing out then rushed slightly into where the light was. The light going out and the cloud forming took about a second. I continued to watch the round cloud and noticed the other could was gone. As I watched the round cloud still trying to rationalize what I saw the round cloud disipated in about 5-7 seconds. It was a clear sky and only some of the brightest stars were still visible. Being a novice pilot and watching stars as a pass-time I can only say this is something I can't explain.",

It seemed to last a while, and as time passed the object began to seemingly stretch and lose the white glow, obtaining a more oblong shape before dissipating and leaving a lingering red haze/glow.

Outside the front porch where I happen to sit a little outside the porch, and they were sitting inside the porch.  So only I can see above the roof and sky but they can\u2019t.  As we playing card I decided to look up the sky.  Suddenly a space ship flew fast and quietly down the sky and came to sit on top of the tree next to the roof.  First I thought it was strange and amazing at the same time. Amazing part was I the only one saw it and I didn\u2019t want to scare my friend them and kept to myself.  So as I saw it coming down clearly it was amazing how fast it was and how it can change it space ship to camouflage that fit the shadow of the tree.  So if a person don\u2019t pay attention you will never know it\u2019s sitting up there.  I was thinking to myself that it might be watching me.  So I make it seem like i didn\u2019t see it but my eye was on it the whole time.   Looking at the same spot it landed in the dark.  I cannot! see it after it landed but I waited and keeping my eyes rolling up on it.  When it\u2019s ready to flew off it lights went around it space ship and it lift itself two three feet above the tree before it flew into the sky and disappeared within 5 sec.  This is true not a joke I wanted to share because I believed that I had really seen this ufo spaceship once in my life.

      "story": "Spectacular triangle's seem in the sky It was 1993 when this event happened. I was living in down town Sacramento, California. I don\u2019t remember what time of year it was, but I lived on the corner of 13th street and F street. I always took my dog out for a potty walk, roughly between 10 and 11p.m. Across from our place was a vacant lot, that I always walked him in. I took him out that night as I always did and walked across the street to the vacant lot. It was a cool evening and the fog was hovering above the roof tops, when I noticed above me, in the fog, lights. I looked up and was amazed at what I saw. There were three sets of triangular lights, each triangle was made up of three long strips of light, formed into each triangle. What ever it was, where ever they came from, was huge, I don\u2019t even believe I could accurately describe the size. They were enter moving about each other, they were red and blue. I could only compare what I was looking at, to some type of computer graphic design you might see on the web. I was so amazed that I ran back into the house and asked my then 15 year old son to come out and look too. He did, and we both stood there in the middle of the street amazed, at what we were watching above our heads, the lights moving in and out of each other, and changing about, while what ever was making them, hid in the fog. I didn\u2019t own a video camera at the time, or I would have tried to film the spectacular sight that was occurring. We stood there, my son and I, for a very long time. Two of our neighbors emerged from their apartment, and at first look, they laughed at us, like what the heck are they doing standing in the middle of the street. And then they too, glanced up to the sky above us, and muttered something to the matter of profanity when they too saw the lights. It was at that moment that the lights disappeared. I have never in my life before or since seem anything like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "A silent anomalous array of 3 white lights some 15-20 feet across flew south along US 5 at no more than 50 feet elevation The second sighting was full of apparent ambiguity. An hour after the first sighting I was on Highway 5 driving north at 70 miles per hour through the San Joaquin Valley. This enormous expanse of agribusiness territory has few settlements along the freeway. It is a desolate area with dry unpopulated low lying hills la short distance to the west To the east as far as the eye can see stretches desert transformed by irrigation into large industrialized farms.  Moving perpendicular to the highway I saw a faint red light crossing from right to left over the Interstate. It was perhaps half a mile away and from its speed and elevation, about fifty feet above the road, I immediately assumed that the red light was the tail light of a car on a freeway overpass. This impression was reinforced when after crossing the freeway the red light became a faint white one, as if I were now viewing a vehicle that had turned left from the overpass and was heading down towards me on an onramp in order to merge with the southbound traffic.  I immediately noticed that there was something wrong with this \"car.\"  Instead of the usual headlight configuration of two, there were three discrete white lights. They initially appeared quite faint in the distance. They were moving down towards me on what I assumed was an onramp. Traveling at about 100 feet per second I was rapidly closing with the lights that were arrayed equidistant from one another in a straight line parallel to the ground. The distance between them was fixed. I quickly realized that they were attached to something much larger than an ordinary car or truck. The light array covered a distance of at least 15 to 20 feet. My mind raced for possible explanations. Perhaps the three white lights were attached to some kind of large construction or agricultural vehicle that was lumbering down the onramp to get on the freeway. Or maybe it was on a side road adjacent to the Interstate. Why such an oversized vehicle would be cruising about at nearly 3 AM when driver fatigue and poor visibility would make such driving particularly dangerous was beyond me.  As I moved steadily closer, the light array suddenly became much brighter. They did not look like headlights at all, but rather like  landing lights of a small plane. As if to confirm this notion, the three lights titled sideways, lifted off the road and then headed up into the sky at a sharp angle. This was crazy! What would a small aircraft be doing flying so close to the ground along a busy Interstate in the middle of the night? It didn\u2019t make any sense at all.  As the object that I assumed was attached to the array headed into the sky, I suddenly could no longer see the three white lights. Instead where they had been last seen was now just a solitary motionless red light. It seemed to be hovering some 50 feet off the ground and was just sort of stuck there in the sky a few dozen yards to the west of the highway. I was able to see this strange unblinking red light for only a few seconds as I speed by headed north.  The thought occurred to me that perhaps I had just seen a crop duster. On rare occasion during the day crop dusters can be seen flying along US 5. They are quite noisy and I believe they move a speed of no less than 80 miles per hour. The object that I had just seen was totally silent. In addition I estimate its speed to have been no more than 30 miles per hour. Its slow approach was one of the reasons why I had assumed it was on some kind of highway onramp. The unknown objects sharp upward turn with its nose pointing practically straight up  is not consistent with the flight characteristics of a small plane.  The entire sighting lasted no more twenty or thirty seconds. As I drove off I carefully noted that there was no overpass above the highway. There was no ramp on which the triad of lights might have possibly descended. Whatever I had seen crossing over the freeway at the beginning of the sighting must have been airborne.",

I was getting really tired and wondered how long I could keep driving before I would have to find a motel and get some sleep.  I was standing by my car looking back towards the freeway when I saw a brilliant intensely blue light falling from the sky.  It moved downward silently at a steady pace.  It was not pinpoint but rather large, perhaps even large enough to be described as a blue orb. I first caught sight of it at about 45 degrees above the horizon. It was so bright that I had no difficulty following it down as it moved behind some trees. It appeared to reach the ground just a few hundred feet away on the west side of the highway. The blue color was significant because it reminded me of the light I had seen over the Sepulveda Pass in September of 92, just a few weeks after Dr. Greer had trained the LA CE-5 Initiative team that I was to coordinate for the next 5 years.",

      "story": "Cigar shaped object, white and silver/metalic in appearance, hovering over Sacramento at noon today I saw a strangely moving cigar/rectangular shaped object over Sacramento today at 12:15 PM today as I was traveling in my car south on Fair Oaks Boulevard near Madison Avenue. I was headed in the direction of Mather Air Field, so I assumed it was a large military plane. As I continued to look at it I noticed that it was not moving fast enough to be an airplane. It was so low in the sky that it should have been moving very fast. I could not make out any wings or tail, just a defined object, white in color, not glowing in any way, with a silver/metallic edge around the bottom and sides. It was shaped like a flattened (or squared) cigar, not completely tubular, and I could see the details of the shape in good detail. It was definitely a technological object\u2014not cloudlike or organic in any way. It appeared to be hovering, possibly moving very slowly to the east. I was looking at the object through my front windshield for probably 30 seconds, as I was driving in slow traffic. I had to brake for traffic in front of me, and lost site of the object for a few moments, then found I saw it again through my driver side window.  I continued to look at the object hovering for another 20 seconds or so until traffic forced me to go forward, at which point I lost site of the object completely. It was as if it just disappeared\u2014but I had to concentrate on the road so I can not say I saw it vanish\u2014I just could not find it again. I thought it could have been a reflection in my window, but since I saw the same defined object from two different windows while craning my head around in the car, and since it was noon on a sunny day, it could not have been a reflection.  I can\u2019t say how high it the sky it was, but I can say that I had the impression that it was the size of a school bus based on the detail that I could make out. No wings, no tail, no markings other than white on the top, silver/metallic on the bottom, with some contours and angular reflections on the bottom and sides.",

They were the same bright, yellowish-white color as an ordinary light bulb filament. As they silently flew on a straight, SW path across the sky, they stayed in a tight group, while smoothly and continuously shifting positions in relation to each other. Their speed and altitude appeared to be very similar to that of an average commercial jet at cruising altitude.

On or about Nov. 13, 1985, I was laying down on the front lawn, watching for the annual Leonids. The night was moderately clear, with enough light pollution to limit stars to the top two thirds of the sky.  Around 7 or 8 pm, about three quarters up the sky in the west (coming to view above the tree) my attention was drawn by what appeared to be a white, glowing line, shaped as follows...  _____     _____________ \\   / \\ / ` ...in reality, the line was a solid. My drawing is also pointing the wrong way - please rotate the figure one quarter turn counterclockwise.  The \"v\" portion pointed westwards.  It was moving soundlessly and in a smooth manner similar to that of a satellite, although slightly faster. It was about a half to a full degree in size from one end to the other, or a bit larger than the full moon when viewed normally.  I had reasonably powerful binoculars on hand (strong enough to view the major moons of Jupiter easily) and through these the line resolved into individual circles or disks, flying very closely together and never altering formation in the slightest.  There were about 15 of them all told - about 4 on the \"short\" end, three on each side of the \"v\" and about another 7 or 8 on the \"long\" end.  They were not attached to each other, but were closely spaced enough to appear a glowing line from the ground. They were white in the center, fading to a fuzzy, blue white on the edges. Focusing them sharply proved impossible.  The line continued eastward and passed from view.  It took about a minute to a minute and a half to cross my sky.  I do not pretend to know what it was, but I am now, in these first few days of 2008, 36 years old, and have been avidly looking up for at least 30 of those years.  I was young when I saw this, only 14 or so, but was a very experienced skywatcher even then. Night after night after night of gazing has shown me thousands of satellites, endless airplanes and helicopters, beautiful meteors and startled birds lit by the lights below them. I have never seen anything like this again, before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

It was really dark and cloudy in the sky so we really could not see above the row of 10 or so lights but could see almost the out line of as it blended into the sky. Now something really struck me later and I do not know if this could be related or if this has happened before to anyone that has witnessed a something like this but the smell of skunk was very strong for 10 to 15 miles of our trip.

I was looking out the window and into the sky, I saw something shinny which I thought might be the sun reflecting on it, but it was far too bright and then I thought it was a plane because of the shape but it had no wings, so I was confused, before I could say anything, and in the blink of an eye it disappeared. Again I stared in shock and searched the sky, knowing a plane couldn't move that fast to get out of my line of sight in the blink of an eye. So then I realized what I had just seen.

Today on my way home on watt ave going north at the intersection of watt and fair   oaks blvd I noticed 2 metal spheres gracefully dancing around in the air flying together simular to the way birds rise and sink on heat up drafts but in circular circle eight patterns kind of playing off of each other.they were fairly high up maybe a couple thousand feet. I stopped to deposit a check at the golden1 on on the corner..and watched more they were moving to the west seemingly slow but got out of site within 3 or 4 minutes so Im assuming fairly fast at that height. I noticed that without my polarized sunglasses on they were fairly hard to see.but with them on they were bright like a electrically charged kind of steel looking glowing hot metal sphere.got a strange feeling in my gut while looking at them,I think some other people near by were wondering what I was looking at.I was too mesmerized to care.Im a fairly avid outdoorsman and bird watcher nature lover...This was none of those things.Very beautiful and Different...Looked technological not organic.I very surprised to see something like this at this time of day..Like I said without my polarized glasses I probably wouldnt of seen it,Strangest thing Ive ever seen lived here my whole life.",

I was driving down the highway on my way home from the mall, I had just picked up my sisters prom dress. As I was driving down the highway, I saw a red blinking light in the sky.  At first i didnt think too much of it, just another airplane.  But when I looked up again, I saw that the light was moving very very slow, too slow to be an airplane, and way to close to the ground.   As I got closer to it, I saw the outline of a craft, and saw that it was cigar shaped.  I pulled out my cell phone to try to get a picture of it, but i began to swerve and I didnt want to hit a car, so i put my phone away.  When i passed it, I looked back and it looked to just be hovering over the highway.   I was freaked out by the whole thing. I kept driving and eventually lost sight of it.

I was on the east side of the Sacramento river, facing west, having just come off Sutterville road and about turn on Riverside. It appeared to be just on the west side of the river, not quite straight ahead, and it was just a little to the right. My first guess was that it was a meteor, and I looked all over the local news next day for stories of a meteor hitting the ground somewhere in west Sacramento, but there was no story. According to a map of the area, the most probable area of impact was in a place with very few streets, which probably means very few houses. It may have struck and not been noticed, or it may not have hit the ground at all. That is what makes it interesting. It should have struck the ground after it went below the top of the trees. It wound seem unlikely for a meteor to evaporate just a couple of hundred feet before it reaches the ground. They usually do so while still high in the atmosphere. I have seen a few of them do just that. It crossed the entire arc of visibility (to me) in less than a second, and did not fade or slow down as it went, as it would have if it was going straight across the sky from behind me. If it was farther away than west Sac, or moving horizontally at high altitude, it had to be huge, and going at an unimaginable speed. It appeared round, and I estimate its size to be about half the diameter of a dime held at arms length. It appeared a little bit fuzzy, so I can't be more exact than that. These flashes in the sky are interesting, but I have never seen anything I can positively identify as an alien vehicle of any sort. I will watch this site to see if anyone else saw this object.",

That was how low the lights were to the highway. That I was going to pass underneath a bridge very soon. At least this was my driving navigation thought process and I kept waiting and waiting for a bridge. Then I realized there was no bridge to go under.

The flashes were evenly spaced; never erratic. It also hung stationary in the air for approximately 35 seconds, then suddenly began to slowly move off until it was obscured by nearby trees approximately ten seconds later. While in the process of moving off, it also appeared to dim somewhat as it (apparently) receded.

On the evening of January 2, 2010, my friend and I were driving East over the Capital Mall bridge from West Sacramento across the Sacramento river into downtown Sacramento.  It was a beautifully clear night.  I noticed lights over the I-5 freeway that seemed to be too low in the sky to be a plane and they didn't appear to be a helicopter.  As we approached the object appeared to be hovering.  I pointed it out to my friend who was driving and said, \"What the hell is that!\"   At that time we were approaching a stop light on the corner of 3rd and Capital Mall and it was clear the object was moving but very slow.   At that point with all the lights from the freeway and building etc, all we could make out were the lights on the object which I think were red and white.  As we turned left heading South on 3rd Street, the object passed overhead slightly to the rear of the truck and we both clearly saw the triangle shape.  It headed West across the Sacramento River tow! ard the Port of Sacramento which is located in West Sacramento.  We both saw the triangle shape clearly as it passed overhead and we could see a white light in the center of the triangle.  Once it went over the river it tilted to the right and headed in a Northerly direction.  There were no news reports of any kind the next day.  It boggles the mind that something that big and that incredably close went unnoticed. BACKGROUND INFO:  My friend and I are both 54 year old females.  She retired from State Service and lives in Idaho but is currently working as a retired annuitant.  Prior to retiring, she was an investigator.

As they neared the moon's position, first the lead light and then the following light turned red and faded quickly.  It was after I had first noticed that the objects were in motion and without blinking or nav/running lights that I sumoned my wife to see for herself.  My background: I was a Boatswain's Mate in the navy, worked as an archaeologist and environmental planner after college.  Presently a planner for the state.  My wife is a Registered Nurse.",

There was a bright object with blue, yellow, green and white beams of lights shooting from it and what looked like a halo around it and at times, I could see beams shooting from it. I grabbed my camera and took a  picture but it would not appear in the photo. I then taped a mini movie of the object and what I saw on camera was not what I saw with the naked eye. I witnessed what I feel is that same ufo on 8/16/09 at 04:00 hours, these objects stayed in the same place in the sky for over 2 hours on those two occasions. The next night 8/17/09 at 12:30 myself and a friend witnessed a similar bright multi colored  object in the sky but closer to us than the other 2 nights. This UFO appeared to be hovering over something and slightly swaying back and forth shooting very bright beams from it. At 01:30, we both saw two other objects in the sky that were fu! rther away. While the bright one gradually moved toward the other two they all appeared to be flashing beams of lights at each other simultaneously. This is all happening now while I am reporting this to you. It is now 03:00 hours and these objects are still in the night sky, but it looks like they are descending father away from us but they all are still visible and the multi colored beams of lights are still visible but are not as bright.",

In the West Southwest sky, southwest of Spica in the Virgo constellation, between Virgo and Hydra, I saw a light in the sky that appeared to be a star.  Moments later, the star began changing colors from yellowish-white to red to blue and flashing excitedly, briefly got brighter, then it appeared to began moving away from the Earth at what I can only assume was a surprising fast rate of speed.  The light grew smaller and smaller until finally is disappeared.  There appeared to be a faint haze around where the lights had been.  The movement away from the Earth was very fast and took only moments. This entire event took only 20-25 seconds.

I was driving to my home in Sacramento from my work in Roseville, California on southbound Interstate 80. As I approached downtown Sacramento I noticed four very bright stars in the sky over the city. Within seconds I realized that one was a distant airplane (because of the red and green lights that I noticed it exhibited as I looked more closely). The \"stars\" were about seven full moons apart from each other. As I got closer to the city I could see that the lights were seemingly stationary because their orientation altered naturally with my approach and the turns in the freeway. I apparently was getting closer to them. As I got into town, near the area of Sutter General Hospital the three lights were to my side. The closest of the lights was about five times bigger than a very bright star or five times a magnitude 1 star. It seemed to be around three hundred feet in the air. I tried to notice how far the closest object was from me but I couldn't tell. At first it looked closer than my exit which was coming up (the 16th Street Exit) but as I approached the exit I could see it was farther away... perhaps twice as far. Still, I knew these were not stars nor some other regular natural celestial phenomena. As I approached them they were in front of me; when I got closer they were next to me and then as I went further they were behind me and they were low in the sky. I had seen them from the vantage of the freeway but as I took the exit which descended onto the surface streets the objects were lost amidst buildings and trees and I could not see them again. In all I saw the objects for about six minutes. Because I was driving on the freeway I could only view them intermittently but, perplexed by their strangeness, tried to make as good an observation as I could and remember as many details as possible.",

It was yellowish-white and somewhat bright (est. magnitude -2), so I thought it was the planet Saturn.  I observed it for approximately 30 seconds; it exhibited no movement or change in intensity, and it \"twinkled\" slightly.  So I shot at it with a violet laser (power output 111.9mW and spectrographically measured wavelength of ~407.5nm).  After shooting at it intermittently for ~10 seconds, the light started to diminish, until ~5 seconds later it had totally extinguished. I discounted phosphenes pretty much at once because the light remained in a fixed position in the sky when my eyes were moved, and discounted a terrestrial aircraft for the same reason, and because no strobes were seen (I would have certainly *NOT* hosed it down with a laser if I had even the slightest suspicion that it was an aircraft!). Conditions at the time of this sighting were clear skies, calm winds, and a temperature of 47\u00b0F (8.33\u00b0C).",

It was moving far slower than any aircraft should have been and was not \"spinning.\" It also was not making any noise at all.  The attitude of the craft was such that it appeared that it wanted to be seen, and seen it was because every car in that drive in was emptied and the occupants were standing, staring at the sight of it.

Though I saw the UFO by Mather AFB (formerly an air force base) over extended right base heading west (by Capital Christian church) it cross over  the flight pattern heading east.  The shape of the object seem more like a comet's tail except it did not flare out like a comet, but more like long lengthy wavering shimmer of white.  Not like a comet where the pattern trail is consistent. This object had waves as it traveled from south to north east.  The closest shape would be a smooth long rectangular see through cloud that was traveling fast and keeping its shape too, Not a lenticular cloud.  As private pilot and air crew in the air force, I have neve! r seen this type of cloud move so fast with a white shimmer contrasting with the black background, the night sky. In fact I have never seen this at all.  It reminds me of a spirit like in the movies, but much longer than a C-5 Air craft. I had time to take good look, around for clouds, other air craft's that are usually noisy, but this one did not have a noise or any sound.  It did not leave a trail, but it did move relatively fast, faster than plane coming into Mather's flying pattern.  In fact I was able to run to the second floor and look out the east window of the house and continued to observe it.  I mention it to my wife who was also upstairs and we both quickly looked out the east window and saw it together.

There I had a very exceptional situation.  Actually with something who is known under the grey aliens in cases in literature. Before this specially night I did not knewn anything about this theme!   The experience have been at July, 14 th at 1:30 a.m. in my guestroom.  Short time after I went to bed the situation has happend. I wasn\u00b4t sleep for sure, the lamp in the room was switched off and it felt a little bit moonlight into the room.  The situation continued between 30 to 60 seconds I guess. I laid on my back, was wake, my eyes were closed and I thought about the time I had been in CA. Suddenly, in that moment I noticed something is wrong in this room.  I had a feeling somebody or more than one person came into the room, but I locked the door before I went to bed.  So I tried opening my eyes and in that moment I heard a very quiet sound like from an engine or something like that. Exacty in that moment I noticed I was unable opening my eyes or moving my body arbitrarily.  So that unknown person or what ever have been now in my guestroom, was able to have an effect on my neural functions, I will say specially on the motor activities. I still tried opening my eyes with all power I got, and however then I was able to open them. I saw somebody standing next to my bed was looking on the middle of my body. Maybe the heigh of that what I saw was about 150 to 170 cm. The figure was analogical like human being. I will say it wasn\u00b4t looking usually human being like me and you, it was really very different. It was standing on two legs upright like a human. The head was a great one and I couldn\u00b4t see any hairs. I saw into a face resembling a human, but also very different from all what we know. It wasn\u00b4t a usual human, but for simpleness I will call it human from now on. So the human had two eyes, but much more greater than our eyes are being and they glow yellow. Where we have got a nose there I saw a longish elevation, who was located from brow area to chin. Downwards it became bigger. On it I saw horizontal subdevisions. The whole face was so much strangeness I only able explaining what I mean exactly in my paintings, specially the new one. The \"nose\" strictly was not a breathing mask or something like that. The head and the face seemed white-blue. I saw the body and head was encased by a transparently blue-white aura or something like that. I only can suppose what this human weared on body. It seemed like a metallic suit like an one-piece. I am not sure if I saw ears. So this human looked at my body with head down. I don\u00b4t know exactly how many seconds passed by, but I appreciate between 10 or 20. After that time I wasn\u00b4t able opening my eyes continuing although I wanted to and I was weak. So they closed and I was thinking to the housekeeper and also nurse (for the grandmother living next to my door). The housekeeper, Cora, laid in the hall on the floor on a mattress, directly before my guestroom-door. Actually the grandmother was ill and needed Coras\u00b4 help again and again in that night, so Cora decided sleeping in hall, because her own room had been on the contrary end of the house. I wanted to cry, but I could not use my voice. So I hoped maybe Cora will remark something, but she did not... In this moment I thought how strange this situation is and I felt so much terrified I can not explain. I really needed all my power to go through this situation at all. Otherwise I noticed the human wasn\u00b4t doing anything bad to me, \"only\" was looking on my body and I was still alive. I know this human was still in my guestroom and also I heard the quiet noise. So I tried opening my eyes again and I was able to do it again. In that moment I saw this human changed position about 90 degrees and was not looking anymore to my body, rather was looking to the guestroom-door. It seemed that he had knewn what I was thinking, in particular I thought to Cora, laid exactly before this door. After some seconds I had no power anymore for opening my eyes and had to close them again. After that suddenly I didn\u00b4t hear the noise anymore and also I was able to move myself and open my ! eyes again like nothing have been happend before. So as soon as possible I switched on the lamp, wrote on a paper what has been going on and opend the door. I waked up Cora for asking her if she noticed anything, but she did not she said. My condition was the same like before and I was still ok. So I stood up and went into the garden before the house for looking if there is anything. But I can\u00b4t see anything strange, went back in the house fast. I coudn\u00b4t sleep in that night anymore. At 3 o\u00b4clock a.m. my stepbrother Lucho came home from work and I told him what happened. He was listening to me and told me an experience about something he saw two years ago. Actually Lucho was standing before the house, was looking into the sky and saw an UFO. He went into the house to his mother and told that to her. So the both went out again for looking and there was no more to see. So the mother told him he should stopp telling things like that. This he told me in that night. Then we thought about the way this human was coming into the guestroom, but we/I still don\u00b4t know. I will repeat: before this night I never have knewn about greys or bedroom visitors or something like that. Till now I attest this is a true event. ((name deleted)) P.S. Sorry for my bad english..",

Other lights were seen to randomly blink within the pattern of the aforementioned  eight steady lights or to blink in an unobserved pattern.  The aircraft made no noise,unlike the helicopters and fixed wing aircraft often seen over this city.  It was traveling in a strait line at similar speeds to local conventional aircraft noted at this relatively low altitude (approximately 500 feet) and was passing due west over 51st Street between J and M Streets toward the state capitol.",

And at that time is when the object was moving slowly and moved and the sun light move off of it and thats when their it was a sauser disk spening and wobbling over my neiborhood.And i know i could not have been the only one to see this but never heard anyone else that day on TV or radio mention the incedent.  And it was not a plane because all planes were grounded for days,so i know it was not that.Also i! was not that far from it I mean it was right their clear as day showing it self to me and how ever else may have seen it.

About 50-75 feet (?) above (I will send a Google Street View of the location) I saw a whitish cylindrical object with a few black lines silently hovering above and slowly rotating (I\u2019ll also email a crude drawing).   I watched it for about 20 seconds, fascinated, when I remembered that I had recently been given a cheap pair of plastic toy binoculars.   Unsure of what I should do, I bolted into the house to get the binoculars so I could see more detail.  I yelled at my parents that there was something in the sky as I ran toward my bedroom.  One of them said that the TV news had reported that a meteor had been spotted.   By the time (2-3 minutes) I made it back outside, the object had d! isappeared.   Even at that age I felt I had seen something very important and decided to write down the date on a piece of paper which I would always keep (of course it only took a couple of months before I lost it!).

I was probably about 10 or 12 years old when the incident took place so that would place it around 1957. It was summertime, probably between 9:30 to 10:00 PM.  A couple of friends and I were in my front yard talking and looking at the stars.  At one point we noticed what looked like a normal star of average intensity (not particularly bright) almost directly overhead except that it was moving around, meandering around really, in no apparent pattern, over a small area of the sky that was equivalent to about the amount of sky that you could block out with a tennis ball held overhead at arm\u2019s length.  At first we thought it might have been something like a weather balloon that was high enough to still be in sunlight even though it was dark at ground level since it wasn't that long after sunset, and was being moved around by high altitude winds.  This meandering pattern continued for maybe 30 \u2013 45 seconds from when we first noticed it, at which point this single star-like object split into three star-like objects of the same size and intensity as the original single point of light.  Within several seconds, these three points of light aligned themselves side by side by side (like three cars in adjacent traffic lanes) and were uniformly apart from each other (the distances between each of the three lights was about the width of a pencil held overhead at arm\u2019s length).  As soon as they were aligned, the three lights moved slowly off across the sky in a southerly or southwesterly direction at a constant speed, in perfectly straight lines, with the three lights staying perfectly abreast of each other and maintaining the equal spacing between each other.  At no time did we hear any sound.",

      "story": "3 bright white lights streak across sky in triangular formation, leave bright trail. I just got back from a run on the track of North Del Rio School Park in Sacramento CA.  At 1:14am Pacific time on 09-02-2011 I was on the north side of the track facing east (approximately 38.621686,-121.452999 according to Google).  I had just finished my run, and was looking up to stretch my neck. I was looking at the sky and what I saw amazed me.  From out of nowhere appeared three white lights clustered closely together in the orientation of a triangle pointing upward from my perspective. In the span of about a second, perhaps a little bit less, the three lights, maintaining their position relative to each other, streaked across the sky from south to north. The lights left a very bright streak of light across the sky.  Actually they left three distinct streaks, one from each light.  The streaks were very close together, and so they blended a bit, but I could still distinguish three separate streaks of light. It's difficult to gauge distance, especially since I am not sure how high up the object was in the sky. But it was close to the Big Dipper in my field of view, so I can say that it traveled about 2.5 to 3 times the width of the Big Dipper's cup.  It started about two cup widths to the south of the Big Dipper, and streaked north crossing the Big Dipper's cup then disappeared instantaneously.  The streaks remained in the sky just a fraction of a second longer, then also disappeared.  The three lights, and the streaks that trailed from them, where extremely bright; brighter than any star in the sky.  I would have taken this for some sort of shooting star, except that I could distinctly make out three points of light giving me the impression of thrusters, like those on the back of the Space Shuttle.  I would like to make clear that I could not see the shape of the craft, and I do not think that the triangular formation of lights represents the shape of the craft itself.  Rather I suspect that the triangular light formation represented the craft's propulsion component only. The shape of the rest of the craft is unknown. There was no sound, and it lasted just a second at the most. I continued to walk around the track for about five more minutes, but I saw nothing further of note in the sky, so I headed home. Once again, it's very hard for me to gauge size or elevation of the object, but the three lights occupied a space that would have fit in the circumference of a dime, or nickel perhaps, from my perspective. And if I had to guess, I'd say it would have had to be up around 18,000ft a least. If I'm right about the altitude, and I may not be, then the size of the object would have to be rather large to occupy the circumference of a dime. While the probability seems remote, since the phenomenon was so brief, I'd be very curious to know if anyone else has had a similar sighting. Relevant background: Student Pilot",

Around 11:30 p.m. Sunday, 12/18/11 I went to lock the garage door and noticed a bright yellow light due west. I watched it for a couple minutes and it didn't look like it was moving. There is an alley behind our house [which in on an exact east/west alignment] and I moved to place telephone wires between me and the light so I could gauge any movement. It was moving, but very slowly. I ran into the house to get binoculars and tell my husband about the light. The binoculars I grabbed SUCK! And I also wear glasses. But he came out with the larger 10xm binoculars and our little Panasonic camera and a monopod. By the time he came out the light had moved from where I initially spotted it in the west. [It would have  been slightly north west from my standing location.] It was moving in a due east direction when I realized it was moving and when I came out from alerting my hubby, it had moved a good hand-span eastward. My husband was taking a 'movie' as well as look! ing through the better binoculars and then the light took a southward turn for a half hand-span and turned southwest at that point. There were spotty clouds in the south and southwest and Jupiter was visible in a large break in those clouds and the yellow light appeared to be maybe going higher, because it seemed to be getting smaller but it was heading for that clearing and Jupiter. My husband said it was appearing smaller because it was entering the cloud cover. He also said it looked like the light was in a plus-sign configuration and that it was more orange than yellow and had panels on it. It was NOT blinking. He thought it might be an 'air-ship'. I said, \"what the heck is an air-ship?\" and he indicated like a blimp or dirigible, but it was so high and then the plus-sign configuration would sort of cancel that out. Eventually Jupiter was swallowed by the clouds and so was the light. We came back inside and looked up NASA and the local news and nothing was indicated as ! anyone else seeing this light [as of today at 7:30 p.m. there ! has stil l been no posts or news of anyone else seeing this that we can find!] The \"movie\" he took is sort of  like one of those hand-held movies...sort of jerky and blurry at times, but you can clearly see the plus-sign shape and that the lights or panels or whatever are not blinking like an airplane. during the seemingly endlessly slow movement of this whatever it was, there were other airplanes in the sky, both heard and seen. We are within several miles of a small airfield and live near a hospital trauma center with a Lifeflight copter that frequently flies overhead. This light was not like anything I've ever seen before and it was so SLOW. And the odd movement where it was heading in an apparently West to East line and then changed directions to move diagonaly from it's overhead spot towards the southwest was especially confusing.",

This spiral appeared to be rotating and was only a few hundred feet above the tree line.  I then noticed that a small white orb was floating into the large circle side of this spiral and as soon as the orb entered the spiral, the entire thing seemed to close in on itself like an accordion and then it all vanished.  I found this amazing due to the fact that this location was less than a mile north of an old military base called McClennan Air Force base.  I had no idea what I saw but in the time after I feel my entire life shifted. The entire thing only lasted two minutes and nobody around me seemed to notice.

      "story": "Bluish pulsing light moving East to West over Sacramento, CA I was outside with my girlfriend smoking cigarettes at the Red Lion Inn in front of our room in Sacramento and looking up at the night sky. We observed and noted the Big Dipper constellation. I then noticed a bluish light a bit larger in size than the stars making up the Big Dipper. I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and confirmed she did as well. We both observed this light move from East to West over Sacramento. It blinked on and off about every 5 seconds.  There were no visible clouds at all. This ruled out the blinking of the object to be from passing behind clouds. We heard no sounds at all overhead. The object moved from just under the handle of the Big Dipper to above the star Arcturus in about 20 seconds. We were able to figure out that it was Arcturus using the Google Sky Map app on my girlfriends phone. It then continued across the sky another 10 seconds and then changed direction in a right angle turn that appeared to head downwards as if coming to an abrupt stop and then descending. The object appeared to descend for about 5 seconds and then disappeared entirely.  The time durations are based on the blinking interval that seemed to again be every 5 seconds. The object was nearly invisible to the naked eye and would only be seen every 5 seconds when it emitted a bright blink or flash that was bluish in color. It was like tracking a firefly flying across your backyard. I noted the time of the event after first seeing the object by checking my watch.  It was a full 11 minutes before the ISS was supposed to transit the sky at 3:46am for that Lat and Long as confirmed by spaceweather.com. I do not believe it was the space station. There were no meteor showers anticipated for the evening either.  I have seen &quot;shooting stars&quot; and this did not match what I have seen during meteor showers. There were no other colored lights such as red to indicate this was a commercial or military aircraft. I may be tempted to believe this was a satellite except for the sharp stop and direction changed we observed in addition to the bright flash it made every 5 seconds as it transited the sky.",

March 3, 2012 Seen in Western Sky or WNW sky over Sacramento, California on March 3d, 2012 at approximately 8:42 PM for about 10 minutes by two people (Husband age 63 and wife, slightly younger)  Appeared as a blue light in the sky that seemed more purple/blue to the husband, more blue to wife.  Have pics. Some red was see by husband and wife but only a little and a little white light seen by wife who has better eyesight.  No lights were flashing. Appeared to be moving fairly low in sky, not flashing and fading in and almost out.  There MAY have been another fainter, light color light in sky with blue light. hard to say.  Cam shows a light but it is possible it was a low in the sky planet or star (shown in one pic)   Viewed from Dealynn St. address just South of Hurley in general direction of Sacramento Metro Airport. No air traffic appeared from this direction although it is a common a busy route for large, commercial aircraft coming from Metro Airport.  Photos were taken with a Sanyo E1090 digital camera on a night setting using full telephoto (which is both optical and electronic with a 3X optical zoom. Camera set at 12 megapixels. The pic don't seem to capture the almost UV (filtered I guess, purple quality of the light which just seem only blue to wife) Husband wears glasses for nearsightedness. 14 photos taken, a few showed nothing, some showed bright blue wavy lines (as if camera was unsteady and \"took it's time to record image) Partial moon nearly directly over head approx. 10 min after observation.  There was one or more helicopters in sky shortly after seeing light, seemingly unrelated and most likely police helicopter () One was using bright lamp to illuminate ground. Helicopter lights were traffic light green, white, and red with flashing with noise. Copter was orbiting to south of residence and later one or same north, possibly going to another site or back to base.  Male observer sees a lot of air traffic from location, mostly large airliners coming toward residence from Metro Airport and somewhat to North. The other common air traffic sources are police and possible traffic helicopters which are very common in area. Small airplanes not common in this area. Facing East at this location (front of building, there is some air traffic from a different airport to the North. Often large Coast Guard aircraft and some corporate aircraft. (Large former airbase is to North)  The blue color of the light is what stood out mostly as well as fact that it seemed to linger.",

It was nearly the same color as the sky, un-iluminated except by light pollution of Sacramento.  It moved at a constant speed from south-north and passed directly overhead.  It appeared to be ~1000-2000 ft in altitude, though that is pure speculation--it was about 3-4in in length from where I was sitting. As it approached I noticed that it was a continuous shape with no discreet elements.  The point of the V was forward and the tails were moving in somewhat of a ribbon-fashion.  At one point the tails angled sharply inward to form an almost complete outline of a triangle.  As it passed into the north the whole length began curling around and overlapping, somewhat like a treble clef.  It was noiseless and was not accelerating.",

I was out on my back porch when I stood up to look at the sky and saw a very bright light, low in the sky towards the horizon.  I quickly looked around at the other dim stars and realized this was too big and too bright to be a star.  I was staring at the light for a couple minutes and noticed it changing in shape from what looked a traditional star (shape), circle, and to a triangle. It was not moving but was pulsating, and would pulse hints of red and blue.  I knew it was not a plane; as one was passing over me, closer then the light but was still smaller and dimmer then the light. I got the light on video for about 2 \u00bd minutes. I am not so sure how to work the zoom on my phone so it does not do it much justice, but you can clearly see it and even a plane passing by, which looks completely different.  The stars where not visible on my video because they were so faint. I am sure it was not a star or plane.  I had to go inside to but my baby to sleep as he started fussing.  I did not want to leave the light, as I felt it was going to do something. It was just something I have never witnessed before. It was almost mesmerizing.  I came back outside immediately after I put my son back to sleep and it was gone.  There were no stars even remotely close to the size and brightness of it.  It had been about 10-15 minutes between when I left it and came back. I can send the video if you are interested.  It is not very good video but you can see the light.

I simply saw an aircraft stay in one place for about fifteen minutes, then shoot off into the sky as fast as a beam of light lights a room.  (There was a fellow there witnessing it with me at the time).  It was far away, so the best description is that it did have what seemed to be saucer shaped lighting around the bottom of the craft. As one light to my left would come on, one on the right would go off.  They were white light.  I've no idea how something stationary could instantly propel away with such a great speed.  From where we were, there was no contrail.  I was too far away to hear or not hear any noise.  There is high probability this craft was near Beale Air Force Base. The best part of this story is what happened three days later. I saw another set of lights in the sky, moving slow over the city.  This was however very very different then what I had seen before, so I decided to try to get under it.  I entered the freeway and headed in the direction of the plane until I was able to get underneath it while exiting on 34th street.  I slowed and stuck my head out to look up.  It was a crop duster with white lights in rows along the entire surface area of the bottom of the wings.  I feel this was to cover up the sighting three days earlier. This happened in Sacramento, Ca, in summer of 1999. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Boomerang shaped wing, flying silent and low over the I-5 outside of Sacramento. In August of 2010, I was staying in Los Angeles for about two months while teaching some Gracie Jiu-Jitsu seminars there. I headed back home (Southern Utah) in October, but decided to go through Northern California, see some friends in Sacramento, then head to Salt Lake City and stay with family for a few days before returning. I took the PCH to somewhere around San Luis Obispo or Paso Robles, then I believe I cut east to the I-5. It was very late (or early)... maybe 3 or 4am... I was about an hour and a half from Sacramento in some rural area with a lot of farm land from what I could tell. From maybe 1 mile away, I started seeing some lights that were really bright and aiming straight down. I slowed down to about 45 miles per hour and was watching them flying from east to west, VERY low (maybe 30' from the ground) over a field, then they would lift to maybe 80' as they flew over the Interstate, then dropped down again on the west side of it. As I got closer, I noticed that a semi was parked almost directly under the line of flight on the east shoulder of the I-5 North I drove up a little further and parked as well. There was almost no traffic at all, so I got out and watched. Being that close, it looked like a large, boomerang shaped wing with 4 or 5 lights (it's been a while and I don't recall exactly how many) aimed straight down. It was completely silent and I estimate it was around 40'-50' from tip to tip. Again, it would fly over the Interstate heading east (toward a little ranch house approximately .5 miles east of the shoulder I was parked on), 20'-30' above the field, then it would raise in elevation right before the ranch house, continue out maybe another mile, make a smooth turn south, and fly directly back to the west again. Always descending in elevation over the field, then raising up over the Interstate, then dropping again. I watched it for around 30 minutes and then decided to continue on. I have been searching for anyone else who may have seen something like that near Sacramento. I simply want to know if it was a civilian or military craft, or something else. If it was civilian or military, why would they be flying over someone's house with spotlights on, over and over and over? And what kind of craft makes absolutely no noise except for the sound of moving through the air? I know it seems strange to write now, but I have wanted some kind of answer since I saw it.

Was that there were 20 to 30 lights flying at low altitude, perhaps 1000 to 2000 feet above the ground.  The lights seemed to be attached to some kind of craft because they were all moving together in Unisom But we could not see a craft. We were driving northbound on I-5 as we approached the lights moving very slowly across the freeway.  They took up a large area across the freeway but as I mentioned we could not see a craft.  My one son thought they may be helicopters flying together but they were moving silently and at a very slow speed. When I caught up to lights and passed underneath them I immediately looked in my rearview mirror  to see where they were going. I saw nothing ,either whatever it was left without me seeing it or the craft or lights could only be seen from one side. Again I could not see a craft nor could my sons just the lights. I asked my 13 twin boys if they too were seeing the lights to make sure I wasn\u2019t imagining things they confirmed seeing the same thing I was seeing. I work as a photojournalist for a local TV station. I called the station to see if anyone else had reported seeing the lights. The person working the assignment desk told  me they had gotten reports about  orange/red lights in the sky the night before, Friday May 31, 2013\u2026 In my career I have seen and flown in many Military aircraft and have also flown in helicopters covering news events. But this was really different there were no white or red blinking lights usually seen on airplanes and I would expect an aircraft flying that low would be very loud and we did not hear a sound.",

I was driving westbound on Auburn Blvd near Norris.  The  orange dots were low in the sky and not in any uniform formation.  I immediately called my mother and she in turn called a friend. All 3 of us saw the same same thing from 3 different locations within Sacramento , CA. I have been going over all of the possibilities in my head as to what t this could have been. h Te sun had already set and there was no sunset after glow.  We do have an airport, but even if it was planes lining up to land, they would be moving and not that close together. Maybe it was Chinese lanterns for a soltice celebration?  Did our local military drop flares from an aircraft?? One of the orange dots actually started to \"fall to the ground.  It turned white in color and stopped falling and hovered in place. All of the other orange dots stayed in place.  One of the dots had 2 smaller dots that moved erratically around it in very close proximity.  When I finally got work I could no longer see the dots in the sky.  On my way to work, I had to make a turn onto another street going southbound and that is when I lost sight of the dots.  My mother and her friend both kept watching them. I saw a helicopter, possibly local law enforcement or the news, travel at a high rate of speed towards the dots.  My mothers friend said she saw a plane approach the dots and they just went away. I don't know if they flew off or just vanished.  I will try to get clarification. Here are some final thoughts: I drive a sports car, which means it sits very low and the windshield has a limited view.  These dots were not that high up, but not ground level either.  My mothers friend lives near the Capital City Freeway (business 80] and Cal Expo. This means there is a lot of light pollution, and these things were very visible in the sky to her.  I have looked online at the local news sites, nothing is mentioned.  I even looked at the airport website, no mention of any major events that would require 20 planes to be in the area.  There were about 6 planes that landed in the time frame this took place.  I don't know where else to look for answers. I am trying to be logical, but this just baffles me.  If it was actual alien UFOs, awesome, if not, then ok, but what was it?  Curiosity is killing this cat. Thank you for your time and energy. Credit to Coast To Coast AM for turning me on to you.",

Looked like green,yellow and red blinking back and forth on one craft.   Stationary at one low level in the sky.  Looked at it for maybe two minutes, (craft @ 2miles away) went over to my porch for less than a minute, went back into the yard and saw the craft about 6 houses away not with blinking lights but now with 5 - bright headlights (like on a car but spaced) seemed to be coming straight for me, no noise from craft, I became afraid and stepped under my porch, walked to the other side of my porch and saw a triangle shaped craft (somewhat like a stealth bomber), flat black, no lights anywhere under the craft, no moon in the sky so it blended into the sky very well.  Looked to be @ 200 ft in the sky, now all lights off, maybe the size of my two story home, I could barely hear the noise from the eng! ine,sounded more like rushing air than a gas powered engine.   I was able to see that is was real because it seemed to be flying at a very slow speed, @ 20 mph. I lost sight of it as it went west through the neighborhood.",

I was driving on I-80 East approaching West Sacramento at approximately 10:30 p.m. A  large, circular, bright, white light appeared in the sky in front of my car. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed and disappeared into thin air. I saw it through very top of my windshield. The sky was clear and there were no other objects in sight. It was much too low to be a plane. It was not a shooting star. It was visable for maybe 2 seconds. I had the window down in my car, the object emitted no sounds that I could hear. My friend was following me in his car. We were returning from Santa Rosa and had been in transit for about two hours. My friend was at a distance of approximately a half mile behind me, so he viewed the object from further away than I saw it. The object passed just within my vision. If it had been a second later, it would have been directly above my car or behind me and I would not have seen it. When we arrived home in Applegate about 45 minutes later, I told my friend that I had seen something in the sky. He said he had also witnessed the object and described it exactly as I had seen it, except he had viewed it from further away. We are both in awe and have never seen anything like it before.",

The balls of light were almost twice the size of a star and flickered a little bit like floating balls of fire.   At first the balls of light formed a serpentine pattern and were low in the sky, as they floated upward they came together to form a slightly curved line with a good amount of space between each one.

At first I didn't pay much attention to it, thinking it may have been a balloon, or a helicopter hovering over the downtown area.   About 15 minutes go by and I realized this object suspended in the sky wasn't moving, or flashing lights, and was to high up for the police and news helicopters I see on a daily basis.   I went to my car and grabbed my cheap pair of binoculars to get a better view.  It looked like a long bus, black in color.  I observed the object for about another half an hour when 15 if not more of my co-workers begin to take notice what was in the sky.   My co-worker went to his car and pulled out his binoculars and the view was better than the my pair.  I couldn't make out any lights, although one co-worker said she saw a blue light on the right side of the object, no one else stated that.   When I was watching the object through my co-workers binocul! ars, I noticed the object looked more saucer shaped, but then it would change to a long bus shape, it was hard to tell what was going on because the object was really high up.   Several people said it was a weather balloon, but this object looked nothing like a weather balloon, and at the altitude it was hovering at, the balloon would have been blown around in the jet stream.   I watched the object until I could no longer see it because the sun went down, and as the sun disappeared, the object remained.  I know it wasn't a bird, or a plane, or a helicopter, or a balloon, what I saw was something I've never seen before, and unexplained in my opinion.",

My mom grabbed ahold of him and held him close to try to calm him down and when he did he told her something that to this day, I will never forget. He told her that he was playing at the school.  Winterstein school in Sacramento, California. He said he was playing in the playground and had looked up to the sky because it got \"cloudy\" all of a sudden.  When he looked up he saw a large silver object that looked like a \"school bus\" with lights all around the middle part and could see \"people\" looking out the \"windows\" at him.  But when he looked closer at them, he said they weren't like any \"people\" but had very large black eyes and were all silver.  My mom got him calmed down and he went into his bedroom and slept for the rest of that day into the next day. My brother finished high school and went into the Air Force as a Radar spec./technician.  He served his tour of duty and I hadn't heard from him for nearly the whole 6 years he had served.  When he got out, he came home and got in contact with the family and I invited him over.  I had a chandelier that needed some work and asked if he would look at it for me.  He was happy to do it.  He got on the ladder and I started to ask him questions about when we were in kindergarten and when he saw the \"school bus\" in the sky.  He affirmed everything that he had told us at the time and said he didn't know what it was and that he had in fact seen the same exact thing four times.  Once again right after he had joined the Air Force while on a training ship, and another time while he was out at sea on his ship coming home from Okinawa and another time after he had bought some property in Bodega Bay, California. I had, at the time, been reading one of Bud Hopkins books that had drawings and depictions of the \"greys\".  I was being very careful about what I was saying as he was looking and sounding a little nervous about talking about it and I didn't want to make him too uncomfortable, yet my curiosity got the best of me and I picked up my book and showed him one of the drawings in the book of an alien with large black eyes and \"dressed\" in \"silver\".  When I showed this to him, he climbed down off the ladder and bluntly told me that he didn't want to talk about it anymore and he would never talk to me about it again.  He was very angry with me for bringing it up and to this day I regret showing it to him at that time.  We have had very little contact since then and I don't know how I can repair the rift that has come between us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

They seemed to be coming toward me, but after second thought I think they were going up.  They started moving away from each other, and then one disappeared, followed by the other disappearing about twenty seconds later. Then, from the horizon, a similar light went up and disappeared, this time by itself. Next, two more lights came from the horizon, just like in the first description, and disappeared after parting ways. The sky was a bit cloudy but not enough to block out stars, etc.  I'm sure it wasn't a commercial aircraft because I saw commercial aircraft flying when I saw the lights.  Very interesting sighting; never seen anything like it before.  I was thinking maybe it was a missile but I've seen those too and they were moving too slowly to be missiles.

I've been wanting to tell this event for a long time, we lived on the corner of 13th and F streets in downtown. across the street from our apartment was a vacant lot where I would walk my dog and let him re-leave himself.   I had walked him over to the lot and he went, my two son's where in the apartment, my youngest was 2 years old and my oldest was 15 years old.   As I was headed back across the street to go home, I don't know what made me look up? maybe it was something my dog did, but I did, I looked up.  It was one of those nights where the fog was sitting just above the tops of the buildings, not on the ground.   There in the fog I saw lights in the shape of a triangle, hovering just above me in the fog.  The triangle was large maybe about 10 ft per side.  I ran back in the house with the dog and told my oldest son to come out with me fast so he could see it, we left the dog in the house and went back down to the street.   The triangle light was still there, we stood there n the middle of the crosswalk staring up at the sky.  For the next several minutes we watched what is somewhat difficult to describe, other than it reminded me of something you might see when dealing with special effects on television, (computers now), but that's not how I would have described it then.   The triangle divided itself in half smoothly without a break in the light, into two triangles, always touching at some point, as they seemed to roll along the others side, before dividing again turning into three then four, almost dancing off of each other.  The lights where bright blues and reds, always changing. It was like watching nothing I have ever seen from anything that I know could be in the sky.   Standing there fixated on these lights, we heard some neighbors come out of the apartment just a few doors down on F street, seeing us standing there staring up into the sky, we heard them laugh and say something to the matter of, \"what the hell are they doing?\" I turned my head and looked at them, there were two people there, and at that point they had looked up, the next thing I heard was, \" Holly ((word deleted)),\" as they too saw the lights in the sky, and then out of no where the lights vanished and it stopped.   The strangest thing about this event, was years later my youngest son when he was somewhere between 8 to 11 years old, told me he remembered as an infant being visited by what he would later know as aliens.    Having very vivid memory's myself as early as 2 years of age about just life, normal stuff, I am inclined to believe him. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

As i went out onto the porch i noticed another pulsing red green and white light about 40\u00b0 to the east but further away.  When i got downstairs to the street, a T intersection in which i can see down the vertical section of the T, i noticed a third green and red pulsing light that appeared much closer and more vibrant. It was low in the sky about even with roof tops about a block away.i felt almost like on the red pulse that a Laser pointer was hitting me but i could see no discernable light in my vicinity. I turned to yell to my wife asking if she could see or feel the same sensation as me. She had gone inside to find a camera when i turned back after no more than three seconds had elapsed the light direct in fron! t of me had vanished.

      "story": "Two college students spotted triangular and spherical UFOs on campus. My friend and I, two community college students from Sacramento, had just gotten out of our classes and were hanging out together on campus.  We were sitting in a spot of grass near the library, which is a fairly open space with a clear view of the sky. Both having had a long day, we were reclined in the grass staring up at the sky when at about 4:40PM, we both noticed something white making its way across the vast stretch of blue. At first glance, it appeared to be a feather being pushed by the wind, but we soon realized it was at much too high of an altitude and was moving far too fast. Upon further inspection, we could see that it resembled a scalene triangle, and spun about and tilted at odd angles while it flew across the sky.  We brushed this off somewhat nonchalantly at first, laughing at the absurdity of the sight. After all, it had been a long day, and we assumed that it was, indeed, just a feather or some other spec of debris, and our eyes were playing tricks on us making the object in question look stranger. That is, until the next object came in. It had only been 10 seconds after the first, if even that, when another white object hovered across the sky in the same manner. This object was perfectly spherical and was not moving about in the same sporadic way as the first. That is, if it was, it wasn\u2019t noticeable because of its shape. It was at the same altitude and was within our view for the same amount of time as the other, a mere 20 seconds or so of a quick and soundless hovering as it made its way across the plain of our vision.  \tWe reported the sighting via hotline right when the incident was over. My friend tried to capture photos and videos of the 2nd object in question, but it was so high up and thus appeared so small that it wasn\u2019t picked up by their iPhone camera. Being that these two objects were so small and were silent, we\u2019re unsure of whether or not there were any other witnesses.",

It just appeared to hover in the same location in the sky with no movement or change in size so it didn't appear to be moving the way an aircraft would.    As we stared at it we were deliberating about what it could be.  It was too big to be a planet but didn't appear to be aircraft.  We were perplexed.   After about 1 minute we looked down into the water as we moved toward the shoreline.   We looked away for about 30 seconds and then my friend said to me that the orb was gone.  I looked up into the clear sky and sure enough it wasn't there.   We spent 30 minutes discussing it and particularly its size (like a planet but bigger too big for that), color (orange glow like ! an ember) and how it disappeared or vanished (disappeared without trace).  It didn't seem logical.   The size and color of the object makes it hard to believe it just vanished.   It was in the high point of the sky and there's no way it sped off.",

Best one i ever seen and so close i raced through stop signs to get near it.  Attaching only cell phone photo i could get while driving.",

      "story": "Luminescent Egg Shaped Object in Sky on SW Flight On March 26, 2016, my husband and I were flying on Southwest Flight 4124 departing from Sacramento, California to San Diego.  We left Sacramento at 1:50 pm to our final destination, Tucson, Arizona. I sat next to the window near the wing.  I was looking out the window to view the snow covered mountains below.  The pilot announced that we were approximately 8 miles up and flying at 39,000 feet.  It was approximately 2:25 pm, I noticed in the distance, a very long, thin, black plume of what appeared to be smoke in the relatively clear blue sky.  At first glance, I thought I was looking at black birds flying in formation.  I asked my husband to take a look and asked him what he thought it was.  He said he didn\u2019t know.  I looked again and saw a brilliant, mirror-like chrome, egg shaped object with, seamless, smooth round edges.  It appeared close, possibly within 2500 feet of the plane but due to perspective differences it could have been much further away.  In comparison to the left wing of the plane, the object took up almost three fourths of the wing.  As it moved, the top of the egg shaped object became visible.  The top was a bright white with a luminosity similar to a ! welding arc.  The top area had an extremely bright white luminescence with what appeared to be white flames in the center portion. My husband looked at this and said he did not know what it was, but believed it was not a plane nor a rocket.  He further stated that it was way too close to the plane to be a launched rocket out of a military air base. After approximately 2 to 2.5 minutes, it then disappeared from view. No one else in the plane appeared to observe it, as many were preoccupied\u2014with shades drawn, sleeping, reading, etc.  My husband later looked on the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) site in the incident/accident report section and found no report of such an object or a rocket launch in the vicinity of our flight path.  A drawing of the object will be mailed to the PO Box listed on your internet site. My background is Nursing and Public Health.  My husband is a retired public school superintendent who teaches School Law and various graduate education courses.",

After I got home and reviewing the video frame by frame I noticed that there were several objects one a triangle and another is sphere.

I was out at night collecting wood pallets, that's the reason I was up so early in the morning.  We ended up in front of a friends house to store the pallets away for the night.  As we were sitting around talking, I noticed a light through the trees.  So I stepped aside to get a better view. When I did get a clear view, I immediately knew exactly what I was looking at.  What I saw was a bright violet light with mist trailing behind it.  It was about the size of a semi truck and it was moving slowly.  So I had called my friend to come and look at it, and around the same time he had eyes on, it had stopped. When the UFO came to a halt, the mist that was trailing it suddenly surrounded the light like a sphere as if it were (For lack of a better term) a force field.  The light maybe 10 seconds after stopping shot away into the night sky like a meteor. I am very knowledgeable in aircraft, this wasn't man made in anyway.  I have actually seen other types of UFOs as well.  This one I am absolutely sure to be extraterrestrial, at the least!  One day I will catch one on camera.  Hopefully my drawings will help others somewhat visualize what I saw, or maybe prove me wrong. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

By the time I got back, my mother said it had faded away, I'm assuming it went back up into the atmosphere?  Then a commercial aircraft passed by and then we saw another star trailing the commercial craft - that one was blinking.  I brought up my binoculars to look at the plane and the blinking thing that was trailing it but it and the plane left my view because my house was obstructing my view.  However, in the area where we first ! spotted the blinking thing that was following craft I saw through the binoculars a silver-whitish gray pill.

The ball shaped object looked to be similar to a burning sparkler like the type kids light on the 4th of July.  The object was flying approximately 50-100 feet above ground and navigating between larger objects in the area.  At first glance it looked like a meteorite with the trail of sparks but it was too low and seemed to navigate around large standing trees, power lines, and two story homes.  I've seen other strange things around this area, but nothing quite like this.  I went to take a closer look to see if maybe it were a crashing plane or meteorite but there was nothing where it should have landed.  I first observed it through trees and assumed the trail of what I'm going to call sparks were just glare, but when it came into the clearing I saw that it was not.  There also seemed to be a dark residue in the sky in the objects flight path, but not smoke. No sound was heard from the object, just a visual observation.  I'm curious if anyone else has seen this object.  I've seen other lights that would hover and make figure 8 patterns in the air, which I tracked for miles while driving home where it settled over an old building and put on a show for 20-30 minutes before disappearing into thin air. This light looked like a police siren that would flash green for a while, then red, then blue, then purple and repeat in no discernible order.  I took a video of this but it somehow got deleted off my phone. When I had looked at this video I saw other strange lights that I didn't see when filming with my phone. This was approximately one year ago. I've seen other very similar lights but just dismiss them now because they are so common. I'm not sure what to make of what I've seen but it keeps getting stranger and stranger as time goes on. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD))",

I estimate the distance of six to eight miles away and the size of approximately 200 yards wide and 100 yards high.  It was huge!  It appeared to be about 1000 feet in elevation.  It hovered or floated around not moving too much, just up and down a little.  The lights went to bright blueish and shut off, then reappeared back into the bright Red, Orange light, very intense light projection. It drifted South across my sight, same distance and elevation, then shut off.  I videoed it with my tablet, but my tablet only recorded a bluish speck, but I was able to take a screenshot from the video at its most intelligible position.  I blew up the speck so you can almost make out the rectangle shape.  I could see it through my tablet as I was recording it and knew it wasn't recording the same brightness and color, but at least I was able to record its presence. This exact same event took place last year starting on May 13th, 2016, and continued most every night for a week and I also took phone video and pictures with my phone of that event(s).

      "story": "Dozens of bright orange circular lights Just after 8:00pm Pacific time, I was walking to my car, when I noticed a bright stationary orange ball of light.  It stayed in one spot for approximately 30 seconds.   I ran inside to get my wife and kids.  They came out and were able to see the light briefly before it seemed to just disappear out of existence.  I just thought it was a little weird but nothing more.  I got into my car, went to grab some groceries about a mile from the house.   About 10 minutes after the original sighting, I was able to see an estimated 20-30 bright orange lights in the exact same area!  Almost in the shape of a flower petal, stretching maybe across 2 miles of sky.  I flew into the driveway honking.  My family ran out. Unfortunately, my wife and kids only saw the last 2 bright orange balls \u201cblink\u201dout of existence for about 10 seconds and then they were gone.   Within a minute there were 2 airplanes circling the area where we had seen the odd lights. We hopped in the car to get out of the suburb lights and chase what we saw.  They did not appear in any capacity again.  For the record I\u2019m a huge skeptic when it comes to any type of UFO talk.  That being said I have no way to explain what we saw in the sky tonight.",

The three objects came to a dead stop, then shot out to the stars  about five times faster than what they were originally traveling and disappeared.   About two weeks later, I was laying on the back deck at about 1 o'clock am, when I was awoken to a extremely bright light, to the point where I had to shade my eyes from being burned.  The bright light lasted for about  30 seconds, then completely shut off.   The following day it felt as though I had severe sunburn  to my skin and my eyes were painful from what I had experienced.   There was nothing remotely  possible of duplicating this light on either my house or my neighbor's house.  To this very day I have told only a few people, and I still am baffled from what I have seen and experienced in both occasions. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.

I was outside a popular coffee shop next to Sacramento City College on Freeport Blvd.  I was enjoying a cigarette and admiring the stucco design above the shop.  All of a sudden, a large silver disc flew over my head directly above me at slow speed!  I was startled at the appearance so close to me.  Just as I had a complete view of the craft another appeared! Then another and a fourth!  They were in a diagonal formation from right to left, the first to the right and the rest to the left.  They were scorched on the surface from heat of entry to our atmosphere.  This gave them a light and dark silver appearance!  There was no sound, no lights, no spinning!  They were about 50 feet in diameter and about 12 feet apart!  I thought of jumping in my car to follow them, but I was worried about having an accident!  I was shaking all over and the streets have cars parked on both sides making it difficult to look up and drive.  I watched for several minutes until they were out of s!ight.  They moved at about running speed on the ground say 6 mph.  Called MUFON about six months later and made this same report.  No one in the coffee shop seemed to believe me.",

On this Sunday evening, I returned home about 8:20 p.m.  Above my house, looking south-to-southeast, I saw a bright white light, that appeared to be flaring upward.  This light sat stationary just above the roof of my house and appeared to change shape, as it slowly descended until the main portion of the light dissolved and flared out.  This bright light measured approximately one-half inch between thumb and index finger with arms extended.  The light sat between two planetary objects, which were also captured in my iPhone still image and video (attached in an email). The principal light source did not appear to be a craft of any sort.  But the high luminosity suggests it was something very unusual, especially as it flared and then dissolved in night sky, below my roof line.  Several minutes later, I walked around the corner, but could not spot it anywhere in the southern sky. (Thanks for all your work in this area over the years, Peter!)",
