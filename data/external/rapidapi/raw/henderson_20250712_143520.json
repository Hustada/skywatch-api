      "story": "I have no doubt of what I saw. It was around April, 2001 in Henderson, Nevada that I was standing in the parking lot of a commercial center.  Around 5:30 P.M., in daylight, I noticed in the sky over my right shoulder a craft hovering in the sky.  I was in the area of Pecos and Sunset Road facing east.  I looked at the craft, and it was in the distance, perhaps hovering somewhere between me and Hoover Dam at 2:30 O\u2019Clock position.  I saw it for maybe 2 or 3 seconds and then the winds made a huge howling sound (like a whoosh)  and the craft moved at lightning speed and disappeared straight on to the horizon, first bearing right then left.  (At first I thought it was a Stealth from Nellis Airfore Base on exercise, but this craft was much larger than a Stealth, perhaps the size of maybe 100 feet wide and maybe 15 feet high.)  I dismissed it as something crazy as it was near the approach of McCarran Airport in Las Vegas, but I never forgot it, and no one will ever convince me that I had not seen an alien craft.  It wasn\u2019t a saucer shape though\u2026 it was different\u2026.it was square, perhaps on a curved edge, as it is hazy in my recollection.  However,  it was definitely not a \u201cround\u201d or \u201coval\u201d vehicle.  There was a certain squareness to it, perhaps with angular edges.  I remember lights too, from the interior.  Anyhow, saw your piece on CNN and decided to submit this.  It\u2019s what I experienced.  What else can I say? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

A light caught my eye in the sky and it was much closer than a star.  More like an airplane traveling over the city at highest altitude.  Upon observing it, I noticed that this solid, white light was moving forward quickly, but in jerking motions forward, then one side to the other, then every now and then it would move backward, only to go forward again.  At times, it would stop completely, then move in tiny circular motions.  It was stationary for approximately 5 minutes, then moved forward and then backward.  My house faces due west and it was traveling from the west to the east.  As it came more overhead, at this time about a 90 degree angle, I began noticing a straight line extending from the white, round base that was also a solid white.  I called Nellis Air Force Base and they gave me your phone number.  I have left a message for you on the phone number that the Air Force Base gave me.  Before signing off, I just went out to check it again.  It is still in one place, but bouncing around in an almost jerky, circular pattern.  I can still see the line of white protruding from the circular base.",

The object disappeared before the airliner could get close enough. A second appearance occured after the airliner was out of my sight. It appeared to be in the same place. At this time, it was very odd that the airliner had altered it's course to intercept the object. On the second appearance, there where two Air Force Jets that were enroute( one from the east and one from the west).The object only remained stationary for about thirty seconds. The two jets came close to the object, but did not intercept it. Before the jets had reached the object, it(the light object)made a quick flash to the left and diappeared again. The two Air Force jets turned opposite of their own path. I remained outside for any other appearance for several minutes. After the jets were out of site, I returned inside my home.",

      "story": "Three stationary saucer shaped objects over Sunrise Mountain, east side of Las Vegas, NV, August 2005. Towards the end of August, 2005, I went out in my backyard to look at the thunder clouds about 5PM.  My backyard was high, faced east and had an unobstructed 180 degree view being forty feet higher than the rooftops to the east.  Thunder storms were developing and cumulous clouds were building.  As I enjoyed the view, I noticed a dark spot in the sky over the south end of \"Sunrise\" Mountain to the NE of Henderson.  Facing east, the object appeared to be at 11 o\u2019clock.  It was against blue sky in a large break between the clouds and it was stationary.  It was roughly above the flight path along Charleston Street that helicopters use for McCarran Airport.  They travel a a couple thousand feet.  This was much higher than that.  To the naked eye it appeared to be large and round.  My first thought was that it might be a helium balloon, but logic told me it was in the wrong place for that, the wrong time of day, and the wrong sort of weather.  The south end of Sunrise Mountain is about five or six miles from my house.  I estimated the altitude of the thing to about 10,000 feet more or less.  I stepped into the house and retrieved binoculars.  The object had not moved.  When I focused on the object I saw it was actually three round shapes fairly close together.  A large round plate was partially hiding another slightly smaller plate behind it at about one o\u2019clock to the first, and a third round plate, appearing smaller yet, at about 2 o\u2019clock to the biggest one.  The relative sizes gave the impression of three objects each at a slightly increasing distances and slightly different altitudes.  They appeared to be dull metallic silver. There were no lights on the objects.  I watched for about a minute, maybe less, and then, through the binoculars I saw all three objects \u201ckeel over\u201d in unison by about 90 degrees at which point they appeared thin and flat.  I called my wife and son and, with a second pair of binoculars, tried to help them spot the objects.  However, they wear glasses, are not used to spotting small objects, etc and they never saw them.  In between trying to help my family to see them too, I watched for another couple of minutes.  Finally, the clouds intervened and hid whatever they were from further view.  My house was about as half mile South of the flight path into McCarran Airport. Commercial aircraft continued to land during this time, basically following Sunset Rd into the airport with landing lights on below about three thousand feet.  They and are a common sight.  This was not a helicopter or an airplane or a harrier jump jet, etc.  All three objects were clearly visible and I have no explanation for what they could have been.

      "story": "Roaring and erratic-moving lights over Henderson, KY Over the period of about 30-40 minutes, a jet-like roaring sound was witnessed by several people including the dispatch officer on duty at our 911 number.  The sound was similar to a jet engine, but pervasive, louder, and seemed to almost vibrate the house.  (It was loud enough to be heard/felt inside a well-insulated house with TV on, for example).  The roaring sound(s) persisted over most of the 30-40 minute period, but may have been multiple (up to six?) discrete events.  On about the fourth event, I personally witnessed a light moving from directly above me to the SE.  the roaring sound came directly from the direction of the light.  For the first few seconds the light appeared to be a fast-moving aircraft (I thought it was a fighter).  The problem is, it was so high that I should never have been able to hear the sound of its engines.  If a commercial or military jet had been low enough to hear, I should have been able to distinguish separate lights (wing lights, etc.)  I couldn't.  This object was just a white-to-maybe-orangish point of light accompanied by a loud roaring sound.  Before it passed out of view over my house, it veered dramatically left, then right, then left again.  I don't want to suggest it was spiraling, but that is what I thought at the time.  It maneuvered much faster than any commercial jet vehicle could have moved (in my field of view at the percieved altitude).  There may have been more than one UFO, as the roaring continued over about 30 minutes, either rising and falling, or multiple events in sequence.  I called the 911 dispatecher and reported the event at approximately 10:15 PM and she confirmed the sound, but at this time, neither of us could find a light in the direction the sound was coing from.  The night sky was absolutely clear.  I first became aware of the roaring when my girlfriend's son called me from across town to report both the sound and that he had drawn a picture of the moon because it had a funny shadow.  (That may not be related to what I witnessed.  I just note it, in case anyone else corroborates it.)",

Airport.   As we follow the airplanes into the distance counting how many coming in, there was a red light standing still at the end of the traffic.  It seemed to be like the next airplane to come in but too far to be in the flight plan to land.  My father in-law said \"Hey, that's not a plane.\" I said \"That looks like it's over the lake or maybe past the lake.\" (Lake Mead)  We watched it for about a minute and then saw it start to travel straight up.  As it started to move, it seemed to slightly shimmy side to side while moving upwards in altitude.  It was hard to judge distance of travel but it lasted about 20 to 25 second before the light turned to a 45 degree angle and continue to ascend at a slower rate.   At the 45 degree angle, the light gradually faded as if it was ascending and traveling away from us. This lasted about 30 seconds before completely fading away.  Unfortunately, I did not have a camera and besides my camera would not have the resolution to pick up the light clearly.  There is no doubt, on my life, that this light was not something an ordinary aircraft could do. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

It took about 45 sec. to respond as I was not sure what I was looking at. Then two other lights, also flashing different colors and shapes, were lined up in the same area as I saw the first. All three were moving at the same speed and sames direction but at some distance apart. That was when I walked backwards to open the front door and ask someone to come out. My mother-in-law came out to see all three lights in the sky. It seemed to me that all three were going north-northeast on gaining altitude.

The moon was full that night, and I wondered why there were kids out on the street at 11pm. After I slowed down, I looked at this object, and it started to take off at an incredible speed down the hill. It was going at a fast speed, but it always maintained a low altitude, almost flying on the ground. I started to accelerate my car speed, until I looked at my spedometer, and realized that I was going 85 to 90 miles and hour trying to catch up with this object. The object left the highway, and I pulled over on the road and I was very shaken. If I were to drive that road again, I probably would remember the white house on the road that seemed to be a farm. The object was parked in front of that house. I got to my home that night, and told my  husband what I had seen that night. He laughed at me,and even when I drew him a picture, he didn't believe me.

The craft displayed no visible lights, but were lit by background light from the city of Las Vegas.  The speed at which they operated seemed extremely slow by comparison to \"normal\" aircraft that I am familiar with, being an airline pilot. And there was complete silence.

I was so struck by the sight of this experience, I remained motionless and made no attempt to obtain binoculars or cameras.  Again, thier size was incredible as was thier total silence and lack of speed as they \"flew\" overhead.

No lights were observed, no sound what so ever, however, not trying to be dramatic, I \"felt\" thier presence, that is the reason I loked up.

I would guess the object was about 2500-5000 feet up, moved in a straight line, and as I have a full view of the mountains to the south of Las Vegas, and it passed so quickly, I would guess it had to have been going about 500-1000 miles per hour to pass east to west so quickly.

It appeared to be a cylinder but I thought it changed to have swept wings similar to a DC-9 for 5 or 10 seconds. However, it never gained any speed other than the 20 knots I mentioned. It was in the neighborhood of about 20 to 25,000 feet as it would be obscured by the cirrus deck directly above it for as much as 30 seconds at a time.  I watched a eastbound airliner go nearly over the top of it (separated by the cirrus deck) so I doubt that crew would see it. The east bound flight (I used to fly that airway a lot) should have been at FL 330 to 370 and moving at a normal speed and cutting a contrail behind it.  My wife verified what I was seeing though her eyes are not as good as mine.  I had her retrieve our digital camera, but the craft disappeared into the cirrus and never reappeared where I could photograph it. I have seen a number of craft over the years but have not previously reported them. This was definitely a UFO and no aircraft, balloon. To skeptics I would ask why it would drift against the prevailing wind if it was a balloon?",

      "story": "Object with pulsating red and white lights appears in the middle of the sky and travels to the horizon at extremely high velocity. I submitted this report to MUFON almost immediately after the event took place. I was not aware of the existence of NUFORC until just now, otherwise I would have submitted it here as well. I have edited it in a few areas where I might not have been as clear as I would have liked (I was understandably in a kind of fervor at the time), but my original report is still on MUFON.com if you\u2019d like to view that as well. I've spent a lot of time observing satellites, stars, planets, meteors and aircraft, and nothing has baffled me like this. I was outside my house smoking a cigarette, and I decided to move a lawn chair out into the yard so I could look at the sky. It was the perfect summer night. All I could hear were crickets, and the skies were clear. I was looking about 40 degrees up to the east, and that's when I saw it appear. It was such a shock to me that I can't tell if it rapidly decelerated to a speed at which it was visible (Who knows?) or if it just \"turned on its lights\". I literally jumped in my seat!  We've all seen meteors, they reach a point at which the friction and pressure of the atmosphere builds up heat which produces incandescent light that we see for usually no more than a fraction of a second. If this was a meteor, then I'm Santa Claus. It was already moving when it appeared (like a meteor), but its brightness didn't fade (the lights did pulsate, however), there was no rapid descent, and I was able to follow it to the horizon. Fireballs have been visible over several states before they either impact the ground (or someone's unfortunate car), but this object wasn't as bright as Jupiter, it left no trail, and nothing was seen breaking off of it. I could be one of the lucky few who have witnessed an earth-grazing fireball, but I doubt it. Here's why: the object had red and white lights, but not lights as you'd expect to see on an aircraft. They weren't points of light; rather there was a center that was brighter than the periphery around it. That's the best I can explain it. The center part wasn't even that bright, but the smooth glow of the light around it really set it apart from anything I'd ever seen. This object definitely had some size to it. Let's assume this was something entering the atmosphere. From my point of view, the apparent size of the object was no smaller than a commercial airliner at cruising altitude, possibly larger. I'm no expert on which altitudes objects start to glow at as they enter the atmosphere, but it\u2019s definitely more than 40,000 feet, making this thing at least as big as an aircraft, if indeed it is something entering the atmosphere. There are lots of variables involved, but that seems logical to me. As meteors have not developed stealth technology since they are essentially rocks, I would have to imagine that this object would appear on radar if it was nothing more than a very large meteor. The object was moving northward, possibly to the NNW. It made no sound whatsoever. If this was an aircraft, it would have to AT LEAST be going mach 1 at roughly 10,000 feet. That's as slow and as low as this thing could have been going. The higher up this thing actually was, the faster it was actually going. Common sense, right? I should have been able to hear something if this was an aircraft. B-2's and F-117's are pretty quiet, but they're also subsonic. All I know for sure is that I saw something extremely unusual travel from 40 degrees above the horizon in the eastern sky to the northern horizon in about five seconds or less. The time at which the event took place eliminates a satellite in low orbit being illuminated by the sun, so either this thing made its own light or was glowing from the heat of entering the atmosphere, possibly both.  Please call or email me if you have any questions, or if I'm flat-out wrong about something. Thank you for looking into it for me.",

I was driving parallel to and about 1 mile West of the runway at Henderson Airport. Since I am a pilot I always tend to scan the sky for aircraft.  I observed what appeared to be a small aircraft landing light moving from West to East and descending at about a 10 degree angle.  This made perfect sense since it was consistent with a small aircraft on a left base to Runway 35.   At this time it was only a small bright white light.  I then noticed that it was traveling at a greater speed than a small aircraft normally would in the traffic pattern.  My thought was that it was a hotshot pilot in a high performance aircraft. Right after I had that thought the white light grew to about 5 times it\u2019s original size and turned a beautiful shade of green and yellow with a long tail of light trailing behind it. It was still descending at a 10 degree angle.  It then disappeared behind some foothills that are located about 5 miles South of the airport.

As I was on my patio I witnessed what seemed to be a fairly large object at high altitude hovering for more than 3 minutes.   As I am a pilot, I do not take this lightly.  My best guess altitude would be 50,000\u2019 then directly up to an unknown altitude out of sight.   The object appeared to be two small spheres or discs that were connected by a straight bridge.  I am convinced that this was not a weather balloon because it was too large, and not of the shape.  I am also convinced that this was not a satellite as there was no horizontal movement for the period, until the object moved out of sight.  I am writing this report now certain that ufo\u2019s do exist.   The quick movement of the object was by no means made of current technology that we have at hand.",

On Thursday, December 06, 2012 my husband and I were on our way home from work and stopped in the Whitney Ranch area to pick up my niece.  While we were waiting (at around 5:30 pm) my husband noticed something strange in the night sky almost directly above us.  The object had been travelling rather fast from South to North when it came to a stop and hovered. This was the Southeast area of the Las Vegas valley.  This area happens to lie directly in the flight path to McCarran airport so it\u2019s not unusual to see aircraft.  The object appeared to be a round sphere, glowing with pulsating red light.  By the way it stopped and hovered we first thought it might be a helicopter at high altitude but it didn\u2019t have the normal lights you\u2019d expect to see on any known aircraft.  It simply pulsated a glowing red light.  At one point, the pulse was rather large and shortly after that there seemed to be a white halo above it for a brief moment.  Immediately following this t! he object seemed to fly straight up very quickly.  The light seemed to become more and more distant and turned a dim white color and we assumed it was heading straight up to a much higher altitude.  This assumption proved incorrect however as we began driving (watching it through the sunroof) my fist impression was that it was taking off at a high speed.  Then I realized it only seemed to be moving because we were moving.  As we made turns through the neighborhood this continued which confirmed that it could not possibly be at the high altitude we thought it had climbed to.  The light had become very faint and it was hardly discernible amid the stars, but as we traveled the stars seemed to stay stationary while this object was obviously very close to us in relation.  It was higher than the incoming airplanes but I cannot judge the altitude.",

We witnessed two bright orange balls of fire cross the sky.  The objects came from the direction of Primm towards Las Vegas.  I would estimate the speed at 300 to 400 mph and the altitude was 8000 feet.  One first crossed the sky and I watched it go up into the sky and disappear.  Approximately three minutes later a second fire ball following the identical flight path repeated. I would estimate the size of each object to have been 20 feet in diameter. The flames were clear to see.  The whole object was a glow.  The flames were going up, the flames were not training behind.  We were thinking that it was a new fireworks device in the form of a drone because it was flying.  It was not shooting across the sky; it was floating across the sky.

      "story": "Bright lights in triangle formation stationary in the sky On the evening of December 12, 2013, at 6:24 pm as I was driving home with a friend after work (I was in the passenger seat and not the one driving and we were driving eastbound on the main highway), I looked out to the right side (southern direction) and noticed 4 military flares being dropped, and I observed them descend at a relatively steady rate until they went below tree line and disappeared.  I have seen military flares being dropped before and there was no question that these were military flares being dropped from an aircraft.  This was not the actual sighting, but I wanted to note that this was a little unusual as I don\u2019t see flares being dropped often personally. At 6:35pm, literally about 9 minutes after seeing the flares being dropped, I observed to my left side (which was in a northerly direction) 3 bright, stationary lights in the sky in a semi triangular formation, which I estimate were at around 15,000 feet elevation.  They were very high in the sky.  At this time I had pulled into a gas station and was stationary and not moving while at the same time observing these lights.  The only reason it had caught my attention was that I had never seen a formation of lights in this manner shining so brightly, not moving, and completely stationary.  The brightness could be compared to the star Sirius, which is considered one of the brightest stars in the sky at night.  At first I thought that these 3 stars were stars/planets, and I was trying to figure out what constellation it was.  About 4 minutes later, the 3 bright lights completely dematerialized and were gone.  I was not able to track them moving at all, they just vanished without ! any trail whatsoever and  disappeared. That area of the city where I had observed the lights has no tall structures or communications towers that could have been the source of the lights, and I was not able to observe any FAA lights that are mandatory for all aircraft in US airspace.  That area is completely level, and the mountains are much further to the west.  The simply appeared as stars in the sky, and then they just vanished.    At this moment I am unable to attribute this sighting as any natural phenomena, as the formation and the brightness of the lights, and then observing them dematerialize was, to me, anything but natural.

They were equally spaced apart all at different altitudes, forming a slanted line if the dots were connected.   As we drove closer (still far in the distance) the lowest of the lights descended to the horizon line.  As we continued to drive and get a better view, the two lights that remained higher projected smaller lights from them.  The highest one projected a small light that hovered above it, while the second remaining light projected a light that seemed to shoot to the higher light much as a shooting star would.

The light in front of the other one was more faint, and both lights were consistent with their brightness.  These looked very high in the sky. I tried tracking these lights as far as I could, but eventually they faded into the night sky.   After observing more, I saw two blinking planes flying in the same pattern, in the same direction as the previous two lights! I was shocked!   After these planes were far in the distance, I looked directly up, and saw, YET ANOTHER faint orb travelling what seems to be very high in the sky, possibly above our atmosphere. It was moving in the opposite direction of the two previous sightings.  After this, I saw the last UFO, very similar to the previous one, and on the same path, except it was moving in the opposite direction. I have a video and picture of the first sighting.  I have lived in Las Vegas my entire life (22yo), and I know what planes (both commercial and military, we have bases near here) look like in the sky... the four orbs were NOT planes! I do believe the blinking objects were planes, but I found it quite curious they were in the same formation and flying in the same direction. :)  Maybe our military keeping an eye on things?",

While sitting in the backyard of my home on May 3, 2014 at 10:00 pm, I observed a bright red ball travel over the Las Vegas Valley area that was very odd.  I have been watching the sky's for some time hoping to see something unexplained like this. After watching aircraft come and go from this busy region, this object stood out because it was a solid red light that never blinked.  No other lights were on the craft.  This object flew a straight path from southwest to northwest, leaving sight after 10 to 15 seconds. I was prepared with a new pair of 7x35 binoculars and was able to view the craft well.  The object was bright red and had a halo effect around it, however this may have been an anomaly because it seemed to be ascending slightly as it traveled northeast out of the valley through a low thin cloud cover. The altitude of this craft appeared to be  2000 to 3000 feet.  It made no sound and appeared that the red glow was at the rear of the object and it would shift and from side to side.   Every craft I see here has solid lights and blinking lights.  I can see in great detail with binoculars even at night.  It left no exhaust trail and was certainly something very different than aircraft.  No wing outlines and it resembled a spherical shape of glowing bright red. Though the craft flew straight, suggesting a fast moving plane, it's behavior was not of any plane I have watched.  A rocket, weather balloon, meteor or helicopter would not act like this object. I was happy to finally see something unexplained in our sky's after months of trying.   We live near Area 51 and a large airforce base.  I suspect they had something to do with the object, which was very unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD))",

On Saturday, May 30, 2015, at approximately 8:00 PM, over the Green Valley area of Henderson, NV, my wife and I got in the car to go out and eat, like we do every Saturday night.   We got in the car and turned around the corner just a 100 ft from our home and a bright light caught the corner of eye and I looked up and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  There was a huge triangular shaped black ship with seven large bright lights on the two sides of the V-shaped front.   I could see the ship up close, as I am sure it was below 1000 ft elevation and still daylight. It had been a rainy and overcast day in the Las Vegas area and it appeared that the ship had just popped out of a low cloud bank.    My wife couldn't see it, as she was sitting on the other side of the car, so I stopped and asked her to get out and look up, but just as she started get out, it disappeared.  It was like someone turned a switch and it disappeared before my eyes.  I had a clear visual look at the ship for about! 45 seconds.   The ship was large with a 300 to 500 ft long triangular sides and looked like a flat black wing which seemed very super sonic.  The unusual thing was the lights, they were not mounted on the superstructure.  There was a rigging made with black pipes attached to the fuselage that held the lights and protruded out from the ship about 10 feet.  I questioned how they could fly through the atmosphere at high speed with lights like that.   There were seven lights, one right on the point and 3 each down each side.  They were large,  rectangular, the longest length vertical.  They were 3 or 4 ft high and 2 or 3 ft wide.  The ship was moving very slow, less than 30 miles an hour and there was no noise of visible engines or intakes. I am very familiar with the B2 bomber, as a saw it fly over very low over us at at the Rose Parade, several years ago.  I also had the opportunity to stand under it at Nellis AFB during Air Force air show a few years ago.  The  ship I saw was bigger than the B2, possibly two or three times the size.  It is scary to even think about this huge thing was hovering only about five or six hundred above the roof tops of the homes in the Las Vegas area.",

They hovered a minute or so then the second to arrive sped off right towards Boulder City with acceleration and speed not capable by humans.  The crafts were silent and the first to arrive was last to go and this time I didn't see the tracer across the sky as it left.  It was either too fast or maybe it went a different direction like straight up.  Either way, this was the strangest thing I have ever seen in the night sky in my lifetime.  I truly feel like there is technology out there that must make ours look like childplay.",

Flights going into Mcarran (LAS) were seen on approach at a lower altitude, flights seemed to be headed towards Lake Mead for their final turn and approach before landing, at the vantage point, it seemed object was 5 times the size of a Boeing 737.

Upon its final light emission a brilliant white orb could be seen at its end and light completely disappeared as if by a light switch, without any prior change is its coloration or brilliance. I have seen meteors showers, meteors, comets, and an avid astronomy amateur.  Most people would dismiss it as a lone meteor or space debris, this object showed no hallmarks of being either.

The light appeared to be approaching Black Mountain but was off in the distance, seemingly 10-20 miles away.   I immediately assumed that it was simply a jet on final into McCarran airport, since the jet traffic routinely make their final turns at Black Mountain.  I glanced at it again about 30 seconds later and noticed that it hadn\u2019t moved in any closer.  Right then the light started to shimmer to a dull orange and went completely black and became a rectangular shaped black object, silhouetted against the dusk sky.  Though the overall object appeared quite small (maybe 1/6 of a full moon) the corners of the rectangle were sharply defined.   I glanced back at it again periodically every few seconds while ! driving and noticed after another 30 seconds a milky tail start to come out of the black rectangular object and cover it in mist.  Five seconds after that it had completely disappeared between my glances at it.  No mist just gone.  I would have assumed it was a meteor viewed face on, had it not been visible for almost 2 minutes in total.",

Flashes of light would emanate from the wheel every few seconds.  This lasted from about 2:30 am to 4:00 am. We have tried many on-line searches to find out if anyone else saw this but no one seems to.  Considering the size of the object and just the fact that it was so incredible to see, I cannot image no one else seeing it that night.  There was no mention of it in our local newspaper, TV news and our co-workers didn\u2019t see it either.  Last June we attended a Coast To Coast radio event and were fortunate to ask George Noory and George Knapp about this, but the were unsure also.

It was moving very fast compared to several other airplanes I also saw coming in or taking off from McCarran Airport.  It was almost teardrop in shape and left a vapor trail of some sort.  In 5 seconds or so the light was gone.  My first thought on this was:  That almost looks like a shooting star but way too big.  Here in Las Vegas the stars are hard to see at night because of the \u201clight pollution\u201d.  I have seen actual shooting stars and of course they look very small but flash only briefly before they vanish.  I jumped on the computer and this site to see if anyone has reported it yet or seen anything here in Henderson, NV.  So far nothing has been reported.  As far as the description of the aircraft I saw, it was almost teardrop in shape, almost shiny and very bright.  In comparison to the other aircraft in the air at the time it had no lights of any kind.  Our airplanes of course have red, white, and green landing lights.  This aircraft did not. I only saw it for approximately 5 seconds kind of like the duration of a shooting star.  Then the whole thing vanished.",
