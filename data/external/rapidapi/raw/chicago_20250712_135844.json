      "story": "My sighting of two objects in Chicago, IL as a pre-teen in the early 50's This event happened when I was a young boy, just pre-teen when I'd guess I was about 12.  I'm now 65 and want to leave this report before I can't.  This would put the event in the very early 50's.  I lived in a south suburb of Chicago (on a small farm), about 20 miles SSW of downtown.  The township was Calumet Park, IL.  One afternoon I was standing in the yard looking due North.  Suddenly coming out of the west there was a very high, extremely fast round object moving west to east.  The speed was unlike anything I had ever seen.  Many times that of the fastest plane.  From the ground the view angle was probably about 60 degrees.  From my distance it appeared to be about three or so times the size of a pin head held at arm's length.  When it was due north of my location it suddenly came to a stop, motionless.  It remained that way for several minutes.  Then another identical object came from the East at the same blazing speed.  It came to a stop right by the other one.  Now there were two of the round objects together.  They hovered for a few minutes.  Then they went straight up, got smaller and smaller until I couldn't see them any more.  There was no sound, no vapor or contrails.  The day was bright and clear, not a cloud in the sky.  No wind.  Just a perfect summer day.  I remember the temperature being plesant too, which would normally mean early summer or late,late spring.  In the above part of the form I'm only guessing month-day-year.

It was difficult to view precisely the objects shape but it appeared somewhat globular. Briefly after viewing the UFO, another aircraft of recognizable shape appeared in the same area at an oblique angle of interception, heading East Northeast. That's all I saw.

My partner made a comment about the planes tonight, she felt like they were moving a lot lower and faster, they seemed more colorful than usual and were interesting to look at so I was laying on our blanket face up staring at the planes in the sky.   After a while of spacing out I realized my attention had fixed on a bright object that wasn\u2019t the moon.  At first it was just a bright red-orange light headed towards earth from the East, if the projectile landed it would be a little bit North of us.  After a minute I asked \u201cDo you see that?\u201d.   We watched it for another minute, trying to understand what it was. My original thought was a foreign space object somehow missing a tail, but my partner\u2019s was that it was a bomb.  She has better eyesight than me and later claimed that the thought of it being a bomb came from the way the light shone against! the surface of the object, like wrapping around its nose, \u201cIt looked like a bullet.\u201d.  It was big, how big is hard to say, but big enough that if it did crash to earth it would destroy the city.   We got up and started to leave, but when no one else followed we questioned our decision.  \u201cIt\u2019s still there.\u201d  I noted, and we both watched it for a few more seconds.  From my perspective it seemed to stop and immediately change directions, now moving parallel to the horizon towards the North, away from us, but my partner believes it \u201cslungshot back the way it came\u201d.  It was completely gone within a second.   I posted a vague question about it on the Fire Jam Facebook event page and two others described the event as well.  I don\u2019t know if what I saw was intelligent life, technology, or space junk, but whatever it was, it made my heart fall into my stomach, I could hardly believe what I was seeing was real.  I feared for my life.",

I thought the moon was obscured by the clouds which was creating an effect of partial visibility.  The light disappeared and I thought it had gone behind the clouds.  I opened the night sky app and pointed it in that direction, and there was no moon there!  Oddly, at the same time, I saw two moving lights, going north to south.  These appeared at first to be in the far distance, but as I tracked them visually, they were decreasing in altitude and appeared between myself and the buildings in front of me.  I suppose these could be drones, used by CP to scout late-night disturbances.  Was just odd to me that there were 2 flying in unison at the same time I saw that weird light in the sky.

My brother ,a neighbor girl  and maybe a few other friends and myself were out in the yard of my parents house one warm nite in 1975 or 1974. We lived in a community that had an amusement park. I say this to say we were familiar with machinery that have different color lights. This object hoovered above us wraped with different color lights.It was spining as it moved through the sky.  We all saw it and we were to young to say UFO.  My latest encounter was summer of 2004. I was with friends at a lecture that deals with phenomanom, theorys ,reptilians Ufos and conspriacies. I hung around after the lecture was over.The lecturer usually has tons of questions and answers for people buying his products for health etc etc etc, after the lecture is done. So it was an unusual wait for me but its fun to hang around and talk about the info that was brought to us by the DOC i call him for now.  The doc and all the left over guest was daparting the house and we were standing in his driveway. Some type of mental energy directed us to look up to the sky just above us. We all looked up and this object that was miles and miles above us was standing still and when it had all our attention it speed off through the air like a nasa rocket with ferrocious speed. It was still and then it speed off to let us know that it was there to protect the DOC or to confirm that we were in sync with the truth. I was stunned myself becouse I witnessed it. We all confirmed that it was a UFO that evening. I believe it blinked a lite for us as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

      "story": "Summer of 1962 Chicago \"Plane towing lighted sign\" flap This sighting occurred in Chicago, IL in the summer of 1962 or 1963. I was 14 or 15 years old at the time and I was with two high school classmates. We were sitting on a park bench in the Sawyer elementary school playground. This is on the south side near 51st and Kedzie.  It was summer vacation and we were out late (about 10 PM). It was already dark but as anyone who knows the city will tell you, the lights from the city will illuminate anything in the air. We noticed this object (which looked like a disk from our angle) move from our right to our left (this equates to south to north). It was fairly large and fairly close. I was about the size of a 474 jumbo jet and it was close enough to look like an airplane making a landing at nearby Midway Airport.  It moved very slowly and there was no sound at all. As I said it looked like a disk from the angle we were viewing it at and it did not have sharp edges \u2013 they were more rounded. The edges had what looked like portholes (round windows) around the periphery of the object. The inside of the object was very brightly lit and it looked like people moving around behind those portholes! I remember seeing at least one \u201cperson\u201d who appeared to be looking at the bird\u2019s eye view of the city! I think the object was rotating but very slowly. Other than the light from the windows there were no other lights.  We watched it slowly make its way very far north and we were able to follow its path until it just appeared as a spec of light which then moved east and disappeared. We were all very exited about this sighting and we decided to call the police to report it. It turned out that many, many people had called about this and the official police explanation was that it was an airplane towing an illuminated sign. I never believed that explanation because I know what I saw and it was NOT an airplane towing a sign.  If anyone else saw this on that night in Chicago please tell what you saw. I would appreciate hearing that someone else was witness to this strange object (notice I did NOT call it a craft although I believe that is what it was). There is one person here who describes the same thing but with square windows and he says it was in September 1964. I am fairly certain that my date is correct \u2013 summer of 1962.

I called the police because we are on the flight path of Ohare airport and I thought a plane part fell or a plane when down.  When 911 answered the phone, they asked where would it land.  I said it had to be close because it was so low but it wasn't coming down in a vertical descent.  It was confusing.  I asked if there were any other 911 calls and they said no.  There wasn't any reports of things crashing to the earth.  The fire ball was maybe 8 feet across.  This was years, maybe 2, before the Ohare reports and I didn't know what to make of it.

It was made like a lot of spikes in two heights, though, and if I had not been looking in that exact spot at that exact time, I would never have seen it.  It was outside the window that overlooks the space between our building and the next, a width of about 5 feet betweein the two buildings.  The day was overcast but it was light outside.  No country, or group of countries could have made this object.  I heard it make no sound but, then, it was outside the window, and it appears to use the air as a stepping stone and it glided toward the window as I happened to look that direction.  It stopped, pivoted once, paused, pivoted again, and left quickly in the direction from which it came.  The best way I can describe seeing it is like seeing Predator, wherein one can look directly at it and not see it unless it moves.  And if you are looking a few feet to the side of it, one would not see it probably.  It was too small to have occupants since it was about 10 to 12 inches in diameter and a portion of that diameter seemed to be made of spikes, but you can see thru it.  It moved \"with purpose\", though, and could not have been some eye phenomenon because I saw it pivot twice.  I only saw it once, and have never heard of anyone quite describe what I saw, or at least I do not know of anyone whose description matches mine.  I did see a fairly similar depiction of my craft, but is was all black in the book, and there was no additional informaton.  I think a good description of the basic shape is that of certain pollen when viewed with an electron microscope, but that would be shape only.  The color is like a crystal that reflects the colors of the overcast sky at daytime.  It did not emit lights or beams, left no trail, and did not land or make any sound.  There were no lights on the object, no aura or haze around it.  It did not change colors any more than a series of crystals would.  There was no aircraft in its vicinity, and it had no noticeable affect on any equipment in my livingroom where I was when I saw it.  I do not have pictures of it.  My sense is that it was a probe of some sort, gathering information of some sort, and it may have taken a picture perhaps on the first pivot.  Who knows?  It is just a guess...

      "story": "4 objects spoted over Lake Michigan in Chicago While laying on the beach at Chicago's North Avenue Beach I was observing planes and birds flying overhead in a perfect blue sky.  While following the path of one plane I noticed a silver dot in the sky of which the plane had just flown under.  Having seen this perspective I was able to observe the silver dot hovering in a motionless position high above land then disappear in what appeared to be an ascet out of the blue sky and out of sight; straight upwards.  This piqued my curriosity and I questioned if what I had seen was real.  30 minutes later an orange or copper colored dot appeared which seemed to be more observable than the silver object I observed earlier.  The orange dot was hovering when suddenly two white dots appeared into sight.  The three objects hovered motionless for some moments then swayed back and forth.  Hovering in a triangle formation.  My initial thoughts were that I was seeing Mars(orange or copper color) and two neighboring stars.  I was skeptical only to the fact that I've never observed stars in the daytime much less Mars.  It also seemed that the formation was shifting from a right triangle to an obtuse triangle which took away any assumptions of planets and stars appearing stationary during the daytime.  I took pictures of the sky using my camera phone.  The quality of the camera I don't think is good enough to have captured these objects digitally.  However if someone would like to examine them I took 5 or so pictures of the sky.  I also walked over to a life guard and pointed out what I was observing.  He had no explanation of what these objects were but did see them as well once I pointed them out.  Minutes later the objects flew off in what appeared to be heading south in the sky.  Their departures were very swift and disappeared in what seemed to last less than a second.  I approached the life guard again and had asked if he still saw the objects in the sky.  He answered no and stated he saw the one object fly off.  As we tried to make sense of what we had just witnessed, another small white object started to appear.  This turned out to be a seagull's down feather descending onto the beach.  Our eyes had not been fooled.  These were not jets, clouds, or feathers.  Instead they mimicked the hours and hours of footage found documenting UFO's.  Which tells me that anyone with a trained eye can spot them.  They've been around for a long time and will continue to be.",

I was waiting for my wife today in our yard, and I looked up into a crystal blue sky and saw what appeared to be a star in the sky.  I was wearing polarized sunglasses and this object was not visible to the naked eye. There were several jet aircraft in the sky at the same time, but this object was much higher up, I thought it might have been the international space station or something.  I went and grabbed my binoculars and I was astounded to see a greenish glowing diamond shaped object, which had five orbs in a formation heading from the north to the southeast. For a second I thought it was a balloon or something, but this object was diamond shaped and had a glowing greenish hue, and had to be near sub orbital, and left no contrails to be a jet plane.  I observed these objects for about ten to fifteen minutes, I showed my wife and her mom and a family friend and they were astounded. The five orbs seemed to be out in front of the greenish diamond object in a perfect formation pattern; their size was much more diminished compared to the greenish object. I didn't even notice them at first and spotted them after watching the Diamond shaped object. I must emphasize that these objects could not be seen with the naked eye, and if I did not have my sunglasses on, I would not have even seen the intial object. I searched the sky to make sure I was not in fact seeing stars, but no other objects similar to it could be seen in the crystal blue sky\u2019s background.  After sometime of viewing them, about only fifteen minutes the objects I was observing simply vanished.  I live on the North side of Chicago and see Aircraft on approach to O\u2019Hare international every day, but these objects had to be 50\u2019000 feet or so, and the greenish Diamond object had to be quite large as it appeared to me to be a star.

I was seated on the right side of the plane in the exit row over the wing. As the plane made its' final approach, the sun was setting in the western sky, and it seemed we were in a low level flight path (say 6,000-10,000') for a period of 10 or 15 minutes (perhaps a holding plan).  During this time, I observed what appeared to be a glass ball only 100-150 ft off the right side of the plane.  The object appeared to be maybe 8' in diameter.  The sunset was shining on the object and was somewhat reflected in the object, such that the round shape of the object was clearly identified. The object was moving in the same direction as the plane, but just slightly slower and slightly lower in elevations such that I initially saw the object ahead of the plane, then watched as the plane slowly passed the object.  I witnessed the object be hidden by the wing as the plane passed, then appeared again behind the wing.  I continued to observe the object until i could no longer see the object from the window as the plane continued to pull ahead.  After witnessing the object, i stood up to see if anyone else in the plane was glued to the window, pointed, talking about it,etc.  I didn't see anybody else that appeared to have seen the object.  The plane landed.  On the way off the plane, I stopped at the door and asked the flight attendants if I could speak with the pilots (cockpit door closed), but was told no.  I asked if they had seen anything and they stated not. I waited in the terminal for the pilots, but they never appeared from the plane/gate.  Have others seemed similar objects.  It was awesome and I would love to hear of similar experiences to corroborate my own. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

One morning in late October 2006, as I prepared to leave for work, I went out to my back yard to feed the pets.  My back door faces east towards the I57 highway which is approximately 400 hundred feet to the east of my home.  I always check the sky and get an idea of the weather.  This was approximately 8:00 AM.   I looked up at the eastern sky which was mostly cloudy and immediately observed a giant circle of a hole - exposing a clear blue sky- in the clouds.  My first thought was that it was not normal.  I looked at it for several minutes, but the clouds never moved or closed over the hole.  I returned indoors, completed my preparations for work and departed the house at approximately 8:45AM.  I could still see that the huge hole in the clouds had not moved or grown any smaller.  I took the north entrance ramp to I57 at Burr Oak Avenue that kept the unusual sky to my immediate right at all times.  Traffic was moderately heavy for a Tuesday morning rush hour, but not slow.   I was able to observe the sky constantly northeast or east of me for the twenty minutes it takes for me to drive from my home to my job on the southeast side of Chicago in the South Shore community.  The formation remained unchanged for the forty-five to sixty minutes that I observed it.  I recall that it was mentioned on the evening news during the weather report because people had called or e-mailed about it.  It was explained away as a cloud occurrence that may have been caused by jet fuel or engine fuel exhaust from a plane.  I thought, \"No Way!\"  I think a picture of it was sent to the Daily Southtown newspaper as well.  I am writing about it because of the sighting that took place at O\u2019Hare Airport occurred on November 7, 2006, and the disk that was observed hovering over the airport hanger was said to have created the exact type of hole which I observed in the eastern sky over the far south side of Chicago a week prior to this event at the airport.

I saw an aircraft of some kind flying VERY low--in contrast to commercial jets in the sky, which from a ground view have tiny blinking lights, the proximity to this aircraft was such that the lights appeared to be the size of grapefruits.   I couldn't see the exact shape, only that three lights (white-red-white) were kind of lined up in a straight line, and they cast a glow on a kind of underbelly shape I could only glimpse.  My thought was that the shape of the thing was almost rectangular, or a straight line, with a very slightly convex underside. The lights were strong enough that I thought, 'they can see me!' through my window, though who knows, and I went away from the window and the aircraft nosies lasted about another half hour.

On a clear summer day on the southside of Chicago, I was at Roseland little league baseball field with a group of other juveniles. Someone in our group said to look up. I looked up and saw a silver metallic disc in the southwest sky of our location. This object was zigzagging at such a fast rate. It was such an abnormal flight pattern. My first thought was that it was possibly a kite. So I looked down to see if anyone had a string below. After not seeing anyone below, I looked up again and continued to see this object zigzag. The best way I can think of describing what I saw is to compare it to someone holding a mirror or metal object, and then reflecting the sun off of it. The event lasted about 45 seconds. The metallic disc then just took off up and out of sight. There were no lights on it; no bulb; no haze; or any other crafts with it.  I went home and expected to see something on the news about it. No such luck. Being that I was a juvenile at the time, I didn't really give it too much thought. I figured there had to be a rational explanation to what we had all seen. Then I figured, it couldn't be from outer space because UFO'S were always depicted to hover, have lights and land. Not be visible in Chicago of all places. This recent report of the sighting at O'Hare has compelled me to tell my story.",

I was looking out the window at a more northerly angle, watching planes making their approach to O\u2019Hare when I noticed a dark gray cloud, for the lack of a better word, hovering near the airport.  I say \"cloud\" because the edges did not seem well defined.  From my vantage point, I would estimate that the \"cloud\" was about a quarter to half mile south of the airport, at approximately 500 ft off the ground.  The \"cloud\" was  about 150-200 ft in length and 50 ft in height.   I thought it was a strange cloud at first, but watched because it was so odd looking and just a little out of place.  There were high level clouds that day but nothing anywhere near as low.  After a minute, another identical cloud approached the first from the north and hovered at the same height about 100 feet away.  The first cloud then slowly moved off to the north, followed by the second cloud about 15 seconds later.

I was even move shocked when I searched google and found a link to a report on this website! Of course this is a most unusual type of siting for this website.  The lights are optical artifacts from the camera equipment.  The go in and out of clouds in the background and change speed and direction.  My only quetion is, did Spielberg, who is obsessed with UFOs/aliens even to the point of lying to people about his birthday so that it matches the Roswell crash.. add this in as a special effect, or did he just get lucky during filming and capture a real UFO on film?",

I had seen 8 round bright-lighted objects standing still in a hovering formation. 2 minutes later at around 5:40am as the Chicago CTA Midway Orange Line Train pulled up to the Halsted station on the corner of Archer Ave and Halsted, these so-called round objects had started to move in a different formation just as they were playing a game called follow the leader, acting as they were doing some kind of a weird dance in the sky. Each of these saucer shape objects had twinkling multi-colored lights with various color changes like: green, blue, red, orange, pink, and purple. One of the saucer shape object had flashed a very bright beam down to something or someone, I couldn\u2019t tell because there were lots of obstacles in the way from where I was looking. These object were about 200 feet off the ground and they were very close like about 2 or 3 city blocks from a distance.

First we were really confused about it that wether its a big jet or big commercial ballon but its shape and size didnt fit anything.It was obviously cylinderical and very big even compared to a big flying jumbo plane.Suddenly ,it disappeared and then we noticed same thing on our north side.We were shocked how it is possible for a flying object to fly so swiftly and appearing on quite opposite direction. At that moment, i grabed my camcorder and tried to capture it ,but unfortunately we were driving at high speed on high way,and object was even flying at higher speed.Suddenly we saw a relativey small sized tear drop shaped flying object,again with a haze around it.

It looks like a star, which is the obvious answer, but when observed through high powered binoculars, the object quickly and constantly changes color from green to red to yellow to white.  It is far more vivid than a typical \"twinkling\" star, especially considering that I can see it through the light pollution of the city (Chicago).  I am 100% certain that it is NOT an airplane as it has remained in the same spot in the sky for several minutes.  I just went out and checked again and it is still there some thirty minutes after I first saw it.  It is in the eastern sky, slightly to the SE, directly below the \"belt\" of the constellation Orion.  It is perhaps one third the way up the horizon.  If it is a star, it is doing some very strange things.  A slight tail can be seen pointing to the left.  I was alerted to this by my father who lives in central Michigan.  He called to tell me about his sighting. He thought it was the comet Holmes and called me.  It is in the wrong part of the sky to be said comet and far too brilliant, as the comet is now barely visible to the naked eye. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD))",

My view is to the north and west with a 22-mile horizon view, broken by the ABA (former Quaker) building to the west.  I looked absentmindedly to the northwest sky and noticed a small, silent, disk-shaped object flying steadily on a southwestern trajectory about a quarter of a mile away and about 600 feet above the ground (it was higher than my balcony and close, but moved behind the 600-foot tall ABA building while I watched it, giving me the opportunity to judge its height).  The top and sides of the disk were completely dark, but the bottom surface was illuminated completely with a brilliant white light, as if a spotlight were shining on it from below.  The disk proceeded steadily in speed, but wobbled as it went, something like a top spinning slightly off its axis, so that every couple of seconds the illuminated underside rotated or leaned into view and then rotated away, but without the craft losing any forward momentum.  (The wobble in the disk looked a lot like the wobble you see in the various news videos of the disks from the daytime mass-event in Mexico a few years ago, which is what I immediately thought of as soon as I saw the object).  After about 20 seconds the object moved behind the ABA building and I waited for about 30 seconds for it to reappear, which it did, much further away due to its southwest trajectory and still moving at the same speed and height.  After another ten seconds it disappeared from view completely behind Marina City's west tower.  I was speechless throughout the incident, prompting my friend on the phone to ask what was wrong.  I explained everything I saw and spent several hours watching the skies from my apartment that night, but the object or another like it did not reappear.  From my apartment, I see hundreds of planes flying to and from O'Hare and flying along the flight path to Midway, as well as helicopters (traffic, police, etc.) all the time, every day and night.  I'm very familiar with the airport flight paths and aircraft lighting schemes, as they're part of my nonstop view out of my windows and off of my balcony.  What I saw last night was like absolutely nothing I have ever seen flying over Chicago.",

      "story": "Several UFO sightings in Chicago, IL during a four hour time span I live in Chicago, IL and I believe that I saw several UFO's yesterday. I was running late for work and I wasn\u2019t paying much attention to the sky as I headed to an elevated train station.  But I had just missed my train as I was climbing the stairs to the platform, at around 5:52 p.m., I knew I was definitely going to be late, because I had to be at work at 6, so I decided to relax since I was going to be late anyway.   I walked to the middle of the platform, which is my favorite spot because there\u2019s an open lot behind the station and a clear view of the sky.  I listened to my MP3 player for a few minutes and for some reason I decided to turn east and face that open parking lot, this was probably at 5:56 p.m. When I did I noticed a round brightly lit ball just sitting in the sky.  The lights didn\u2019t blink.  So at first I thought it was a plane, because I wasn\u2019t expecting to see something different than that.  I soon realized that it definitely wasn\u2019t a plane because it was dark outside.  Although planes have lights that are visible at night their frames aren't.  Planes also always move while they\u2019re mid-air, and they\u2019ll appear larger or smaller eventually depending on which direction they are heading.  This object seemed to be a ball that was illuminated all over, it didn\u2019t move, and it appeared the same size the whole time I looked at it.  Then as I looked further past it, eastward, I saw two other objects that were identical to the first one.  They all were in a perfectly straight line with one another, the line made a diagonal from where I was standing.  These objects didn't move either.  I know they had to be miles apart realistically, but from where I was standing they only seemed about 50 - 75 ft. apart from one another. Suddenly I saw the first object head westbound straight across the sky, it covered the distance pretty quickly, I\u2019d say more quickly then the average plane would, but not astronomically so.  I didn\u2019t hear any noise as this happened.  The other objects stayed in position and didn\u2019t move.  About 30 seconds after seeing this, my train arrived at my platform; this was at 6:02 p.m.   I sat down and looked out of the window, and kept my eyes eastward on the sky for the length of my trip.  As soon as we\u2019d covered about 4 or 5 blocks, I noticed that there hadn\u2019t been two other objects behind the first one that had flown off.  There had actually been 3. I saw that even though this one was the furthest away from me, it was brightly lit and looked identical to those others, and it was next in the diagonal line, and it too just sat there in the sky as well. My train headed north to the downtown section of Chicago, and even as I covered at least 30 blocks worth of distance, from the original point at which I saw the objects, they were still very visible, and very bright, until some of the high rise buildings started to block my view. I know that they weren\u2019t moving, because as I was riding on the train and looking out at the objects, they started to appear as if they were moving with me, in the same direction I was traveling, which is how the moon, or water towers of local suburbs, used to appear to me when I was younger riding in a car. Obviously a water tower is a fixed object, and it looked like it moved with me, so I know the same has to be true of these objects. My trip to downtown took about 15 minutes, because I arrived at work at 6:17 p.m. as I said, a few minutes before, my view of the objects had been blocked, but my eyes were still on the sky in case there was a clearing. I didn\u2019t see the objects again, but I did see another aircraft flying a few miles higher than me, but parallel to the train I was on. I only glimpsed it for a few seconds because the buildings blocked my view. It could have been just a plane, but it was so low, and I think there\u2019s some sort of a no fly zone, in downtown Chicago, so I don\u2019t know why a plane would fly so close in that area. This is the only object whose shape I can\u2019t really describe, it was possibly rectangular, but I didn\u2019t get to really look at it. I just remember it flying in between one of the high rises, and it was brightly lit, but the craft itself was dark, probably brown. I felt that it looked odd because it didn\u2019t look like a plane, yet it was flying. It was also bulky and heavy, looking, but quickly disappeared from my view. I definitely know that it didn\u2019t resemble a plane at all.  I eventually went to work for four hours but I really hoped, that the objects I\u2019d seen by my house would still be there when I got off, so that I could show someone in my family what I\u2019d seen. I didn\u2019t remember to look at the sky when I was on the platform because I was in a rush to get home, but when I was on the ground, about a block east of the train station, I walked southeast where there\u2019s an open area of sky because of a parking lot. As I was crossing the street and heading south, I saw one of the objects or perhaps another one that was in the same vicinity of the ones I\u2019d seen earlier. Only this time it was way closer to the ground than the ones I'd noticed earlier. I made my way onto the sidewalk and realized that the big concrete roof of the parking lot was blocking my view. So the object had to be very close to the ground because the roof of the parking lot is only about 15-20 ft high. I decided to back up a few feet and I walked in the street instead of the sidewalk in order to get a good look at the object.  I did, and basically I saw an object that resembled a saucer, but it wasn\u2019t a flat thin disc, it had layers. The top layer was full of deep burgundy lights and so was the bottom one, I think they were on but they were very dull and nearly blended into the dark sky, that\u2019s probably why I didn\u2019t see them earlier. But the center layer was bright, bright white. The whole object was saucer shaped, and all of the lights looked like they were framed by rectangles. So they just looked like panels of lights. I do not know if I\u2019d imagined it from the influence of TV and movies, but I do remember thinking that it hovered and rocked a little, instead of being completely still, but that could have been my mind adding that part in because I was so excited. As I kept walking south, my view was blocked again by the roof of the parking lot, so maybe the object had moved. About 20 seconds later, I\u2019d moved past the parking lot\u2019s roof, and parallel to the entrance of the parking lot.  This entrance isn\u2019t enclosed by a roof, so there\u2019s a very clear view of the sky but I still didn\u2019t see the object. It was gone. I continued my way south and walked past the apartment building attached to the parking lot, which unfortunately blocked my view, because it too, is a high rise. About another 20-30 seconds later I continued my way south and crossed the street opposite this high rise, where there are just small houses and apt. buildings, which leave a better view of the sky and I still saw no objects, I headed east to get back to my building, and there still was no object in sight. But I kept my eyes on the sky for most of my walk and I did start to notice the stars, usually I don\u2019t. They were visible, but since it\u2019s Chicago and we have lots of lights and air pollution they aren\u2019t blindingly white. So when I saw another object later on, I was totally sure it wasn\u2019t a star.  I arrived inside my apt. at around 10:35 pm. About ten minutes later I turned off the light, in my bedroom and looked out of the window. I noticed a blinking object, west of my back window, which is further south in Chicago. It was much higher than the last one I\u2019d just seen, and I would have taken it as a star if I hadn\u2019t looked at the stars a few minutes ago when I was outside. This object was far away, but it wasn't as far as the stars were, and it was much brighter and bigger than the stars. It's light was white but it blinked on and off. I made out a reddish light that came from it as well. It too seemed to stand still and I think it was probably the same object that I\u2019d seen 20 minutes before, when I was outside. But I\u2019m not sure, I couldn\u2019t tell its shape from so far away.  As I was gazing at the sky, I then saw a really large object traveling somewhat close to the ground, maybe 30 miles above that had a bright light attached underneath it. It was large and it was loud. I ran to the front of my apartment to get a better look, because it was fast and I believe this was a plane, but I do not believe it was a commercial plane, because it was so bulky, and because of the light coming from it, and because it was a dark color, I think it was a brown or bronze type of shade. It quickly covered the sky and was out of my sight within a minute or two, so I went back to the my other window to see the blinking object. It was still there, but it looked even further away, yet it was still very bright though. So I just decided to watch some TV because I couldn\u2019t do anything about it and then I went to bed.",

It continued to hover and twinkle for aprox. 40 seconds. At one point towards the end of the 40 seconds, I waved and said \"HI!\" at the top of my lungs.

Once in a great while I check this sight because on two occasions in the past I have seen grey, airplane-like objects with no lights or markings or sound, gliding over Chicago. I never bothered to submit a sighting until now, noticing that what I saw recently matches the descriptions of other entries with coinciding dates. I was driving Eastward down Irving Park Road in Chicago and I looked out the window and saw a Triangular shaped object (with rounded corners) with approximately 6 orange lights around the perimeter on the bottom of the object. No other or flashing lights at all. It appeared to be the size of a commercial aircraft but definitely lower than one should be flying. It also appeared to be just hovering. Now that area is common for aircraft coming into O\u2019Hare airport from the east at lower altitudes so I took that in consideration. I also took into consideration the speed I was driving. It also occurred to me at that time that the Chicago Air and Water show was in a couple days. I've never been to the Air and Water show but I do not believe anything like that is part of it. I pulled over and watched it just sit there, hovering. I had the window down and could not hear any noise other than the traffic. Then it started to slowly move to the South West. I looked over at the bus stop and saw a man in his 20s staring up at the sky with his jaw open (giving me validation). When I looked back up it was gone.

      "story": "August 23, 2009 Seven Chicago Witnesses view strange Orange Red balls of light in night sky. On August 23, 2009 at about 930p seven eye witnesses watched two orange balls of light slowly appear from the sky then slowly disappear. Their pattern of flight began from the South East and moved North West over Chicago. It was a very clear summer night many stars and different easily identified aircraft could be seen. The two balls of red/orange light appeared then disappeared. I could see as one elevated very high in the sky then resembled a star that began streaking West. About 5 mins later a line of orange/red lights then began to appear and slowly move into a triangle formation. Each light then slowly faded out. After the lights disappeared a variety of terrestrial craft small planes, jets, helicopters began to move into the area above NW Chicago where the lights had been. After about a half hour a large red and green triangle solid object began to make schedule circles around the NW side of the City in the sky possibly over Lake Michigan. All of this ! was witnessed by seven different adults and none had an explaining for what was seen. They were not meteors because they were transfixed at times and moved in others. They were not Chinese lanterns because they came down from the atmosphere then projected back up. I tried to capture to image on my Cell phone video camera but the phone camera was not adequate to film something with such low light. I did manage to catch a small amount. My friend then did get her camera and managed to take some video and photos of what we were witnessing. In my video (the bad one) you can faintly see the triangle formation it made but also listen to the peoples reaction of it. In my friends video you can see the objects in the sky and here the same reaction. Here is my friends link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aYx1IiTc68 and my link is http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=334Yh9r09K0 both videos and sound are from the same occurrence (date/time). When I first saw them my first feeling was of terr! or because I had no explanation for what it was then I was hop! ing alie ns were not preparing to invade Earth. It made me very nervous. Three of my friends and myself that were witness to the encounter work in the aerospace industry and have never seen anything like it before. The ages of the witnesses are from 25 to 55. I have searched 'Orange balls of light\" on YouTube and have seen different various videos of exactly what we saw in Chicago but filmed all over the world. The night we saw them there were at least 6 to 7 objects in the sky total.",

As we went into the backyard we spotted a triangular shaped object (dull white or grey)with a small light on each tip. It was maybe 12 to 14 feet long and perhaps 5-6 feet thick in the middle (it was tapered). I saw it from full left to right; the timing was perfect. It was completely silent, and traveling about 60 feet off the ground following the power lines (from SE to NW) at about 10 knots. I had it in full view for what seemed an eternity- it was maybe 2 minutes. I was 15 at the time and neither I nor my friend thought the houseful of people we just left would believe us so we kept it a secret.

      "story": "Surprised by disc hovering above the highway in front of me. I have withheld reporting this event for 44 years. While driving south on South Lake Shore Drive leaving downtown Chicago, I saw an air born object fly from above Lake Michigan and stop, then hover directly over Lake Shore Drive in front of me at a height of approximately 2000 to 5000 feet. It appeared to be quite large and so close that I could clearly see it was a disc shaped object with a continuous single row of what appeared to be lighted square windows completely surrounding its perimeter. Its only other characteristic was that it appeared to be slowly revolving horizontally. An awkward estimation of its size would be 500 feet across. It did not emit any sound at any time during the event. After about 30 seconds it slowly moved with increasing speed back over the Lake, stopped and hovered there for a few seconds, then darted very very quickly further over the Lake and out of sight over the horizon. Although I slowed slightly as I viewed this event in amazement, the traffic on the highway was brisk and prevented me from stopping. The witness who was riding beside me in the car also saw this event, but thought better of reporting it as she was and still is of he character of not drawing any sort of attention to herself, and after 42 years of marriage continues to be in denial regarding this event stating she does not remember it as she fears that people will laugh at her. Since she would not back up our mutual sighting, I never reported it until now. This event remains as one of the few vivid memories in my life and I will never forget it.

Suddenly it started to walk around my bed and that's when I realize I couldn't move my body only my eyes.  I followed this being with my eyes, had the impression it was a female.  This being had long dirty blond hair, big eyes, a slit for a mouth, and two little holes for a nose, its skin was a blueish-greenish color. It stand next to my bed and again in my own voice it told me that everything was going to be OK. It sat down on the side of my bed, reached over and began to massage my bad knee in which I had p! roblems walking and going up stairs and not to mention the pain I had with this knee all day just relaxing it. Next thing I know I woke up not realizing what happened over night and started walking to the bathroom and that's when it hit me, my pain was gone. I began to jump up and down and jiggled my leg and that's when I was puzzled, and the suppose dream I had popped in my head. I don't know what happened but my pain which I had been going threw for years was gone after that incident and I don't know what to think about it. Till this day my knee is fine.

      "story": "Multiple blinking orange orbs over downtown and north side of Chicago I live in a downtown Chicago high-rise (in the River North neighborhood, immediately north of the Loop) above the 45th floor with a view to the west and northwest.  At 11pm on Friday, August 22, 2008 I went out on my balcony to get some air and saw in the distance approximately five blinking orange orbs in close formation hovering about 500 feet above the western side of the River North neighborhood (possibly a bt further west, above River West).  Very quickly the objects individually blinked on and off in a seemingly random manner, almost like a strobe light atop an emergency vehicle.  I thought at first they were the lights of an emergency helicopter (sometimes I see medical flights to rooftop helipads at hospitals on the north side), but the lights just hovered and blinked, moved slightly to the south, and faded out/stopped blinking.  While \"on\", the light they gave off was an intense orange, the kind you might see at the working end of a blow torch.  Really pure, really bright and intense. I stood there for several minutes wondering what I had seen.  Twice in the past year, I have seen individual unexplained objects above downtown Chicago and the western suburbs (one of which I reported to NUFORC), and I expected what I had just seen was also out of the ordinary. After waiting for the lights to return to no avail, I returned to my apartment.  About half an hour later, through my window I noticed an individual blinking orange orb in a different location but near to where I had seen the original formation.  This orb was low to the ground, about at rooftop level.  It strobed for a few seconds and then disappeared. I went out on the balcony again and waited.  About a minute later, the light reappeared for 10 seconds or so and then faded out.  It occurred to me if the grouping of lights I had originally seen had broken up, I might see other individual orbs above the city. I stayed out on the balcony for about half an hour (by now it was around midnight or maybe a little bit later).  During that time, I witnessed another very intense blinking orange orb above the Lincoln Park neighborhood.  This was not the signal light atop Children's Memorial Hospital on Lincoln (which was also clearly visible) but was east of it, closer to the park itself.  This light moved slightly east and west while I watched it, and blinked in a rapid, staccato manner in three volleys of about 15 seconds each, with gaps of perhaps 15 or 20 seconds between each volley.  The light was as intense as the others I had seen, and seemed weirdly bright given the distance from which I was viewing it.  I had the feeling something was being surveyed by the light at specific intervals.  After a couple of minutes, this light disappeared and did not return. I also saw what may have been blinking orbs in two other locations, both much further to the northwest and closer to the horizon.  However, due to the distance, although those lights were blinking in the same odd manner, I can't be sure.  However, the formation of lights and the two individual orbs that I saw were identical in behavior. The funny part of the entire event, each time I saw the lights I thought, \"you're kidding, these can't be what I think they are,\" and then a few minutes later they would reappear doing the same things I doubted I had just seen them do. I've lived in this high-rise for years and have seen hundreds of planes and helicopters come and go.  I have never, ever seen anything like what I saw tonight.  I looked through the NUFORC reports and found a similar report of orbs over Lake Michigan exhibiting similar behavior on AUgust 8th.  I get the feeling I just saw those same orbs, only this time over the city.  I can't be the only one to have seen these things tonight.

      "story": "ufo in fireworks display I was visiting my son and his wife in Chicago over the 4th of July. He lives in a high rise apartment building over 40 stories tall near Lake Michigan. We went to the roof to have a panoramic view of the fireworks around the city.  There were a great number of fireworks particularly in the out-lying areas of the city. Even with the city lights the fireworks were phenonmenal. At one point I noticed an area of intense firework activity. I only focused on it for a few seconds then scanned other areas. When I returned my gaze to this spot I noticed some of the lights seemed to be hanging in one spot for an unusually long period. \"How do they make them do that,\" I asked myself. Then I pointed it out to my son.  Again I was distracted. When I glanced back the lights were still hanging there. They seemed to form a \"hat-shape\" with red and green lights which shimmered around the form. UFO popped into my mind but I discounted it.  I was once more distracted. When I looked back again at this \"hat-shaped\" object six very bright golden orbs seemed to emanate from it and hang momentarily around it.  My mind seemed to be affected by what I saw. I certainly felt spaced out. (I don't drink or do mind-altering substances stronger than coffee.) When I looked again for the object, it had disappeared along with the orbs.  It wasn't until the next day that I realized that I'd seen a UFO. I'm over 60 years old and this is the first one I've ever seen one though I do believe we are visited, if not influenced, by aliens. I broached the subject of the sighting with my son & daughter-in-law. He's an engineer and she's an accountant. He brushed off the UFO hypothesis. She said nothing except she hadn't noticed anything.  I feel the need to communicate this with someone, hence this letter.  Peace to all...",

The Big Dipper was right above the yard and I was admiring the stars.  An object suddenly came into view overhead.  It was flying a little higher than a helicopter typically flies around my neighborhood.  However, there was no sound - there were no lights - and it had a reddish tint to it.  It just quickly floated off to the North.  I did seem to hear a small rumble after it had passed out of sight.  It almost seemed like it didn't hold form... yet it was in sort of a cigar shaped formation.  I have always had interest in UFO's and whatnot.  You always hear of flying saucers actually being weather balloons.  Well, this could have been just that... it did sort of look like a really big deflated balloon flying very quickly.

      "story": "Large Hovering Triangle Observed in Chicago Suburbs November 2008 During the fall of 2008, I commuted back and forth to O'Hare, arriving on Sunday afternoon/evening to work for the week, and leaving Friday afternoon.  I became very familiar with the flight pattern into and back out of the airport, having taken over 15 trips by the date of this sighting.   After arriving at the airport I would rent a car and travel East on Touhy to my hotel in Skokie.  Each week I enjoyed watching the incoming flight line.  Planes would only be about a few hundred to a couple thousand feet up at that point.  I knew this by listening to the flight deck communications when I would arrive.   On this Sunday early evening I noticed a particularly large aircraft with the typical front fuselage and side wing lights in a triangle pattern.  Usually the larger aircraft appear to be moving slowly due to their size.  As I traveled east on Touhy, however, I noticed that this large aircraft appeared to be moving too slowly - not what I was used to seeing.  Within a few moments I realized it was hovering, and the motion was mine.   As I approached Western Ave intersection I noted that it was hovering above buildings to my right.  I turned the corner on Greenwood to make a run around the block to hopefully see it from behind.  Instead I saw it in the same place as I rounded the block - it definitely was hovering, and it was a large dark triangle with a few lights to define its shape.   On Touhy again I decided to round the block one more time and stop on a side street to get out to have a look.  By the time I got to a stopping place it was gone.  At no time did I hear any noise from the object.   I am a research scientist with trained observation skills, and can say for sure that I saw a hovering triange shaped aircraft that was out of place in this area.  On my return to the airport Wednesday of that week (it was Thanksgiving week) it was daylight, and I noted that there were no towers or any other structures in the area that could have explained this craft.   I have permanently located to the Chica go area now and would be happy to review the sighting on site.",

It appeared to travel slightly slower than a usual shooting star as well. I don't think this was an alien spacecraft; but could it have been some space junk re-entering the atmosphere or perhaps an iridium flare?

From our vantage point, we could see the flight pattern of planes on their final approach to O'Hare Airport (about 10 miles due west of us).  The planes were coming in low, at approximately 2000 feet, at 1:30 min. intervals.  The fireball was clearly well below the cloud ceiling, roughly at the same altitude as the approaching aircraft.  The fireball had a long blue-green streak trailing behind it as it dissipated in the SE sky toward Lake Michigan.  We also noticed the flight pattern of the planes seemed to change after our observance. Tom Skilling, weatherman at WGN TV, also reported during his 9:30pm weather segment, that there were several calls to the station reporting similar sightings. He was going to follow up... no news reports in the mainstream media as of yet.",

      "story": "I live on the southside of Chicago in a neighborhood called Mount Greenwood. I got off of work around 11:30 PM on Wednesday, June 18th, 2008.  I went home and everything seemed normal until i went outside for a cigarette around 12:30 AM Thursday, June 19th.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye a quick flash of light. When I looked up, I saw an EXTREMELY faint light moving in very erratic patterns at an unbelievably fast speed.  Basically, it was zig-zagging in all different directions at a brightness and speed that made it hardly even noticeable. I went to go wake up my little brother and show him. He said he saw it too, but didn't give it much thought and went back to bed. I sat out there and watched for a bit longer until I noticed that the zooming, zig-zagging lights were EVERYWHERE. They weren't birds, nor shooting stars or airplanes or jets.  This is unlike anything I have ever seen before.  I went upstairs to film this happening on an old video camera that we have had since the 90's.  The camera did a very poor job picking up anything too strange because of how dark it was outside, the age of the camera, and the faintness of the lights. To make sure I wasn't going crazy, I called one of my friends to come over and watch the sky with me and he agreed. I got in my car to go pick him up. We got back to my house about ten minutes later, and this is when the weird stuff started happening.  Instantly, I noticed that there were more stars out than there were before I left.  I looked up and I saw one of them hovering, moving in very small circles.  This was not some star obscured by clouds as skeptics may say.  This thing was moving.  THEN we noticed that the moving light began shooting out other lights.  When they would shoot out, a very small trail of vapour was seen behind them but only for a second.  After a while, we noticed some patterns.  The lights really only moved when they shot out other lights (except of course those faint \"zooming zig-zaggers\" which went on all night). Also, we noticed just how many lights formed triangle shapes in the sky.  Most noticeably were three very bright lights which seemed to be directly above my house which formed an almost perfect triangle.  We continued to watch this amazing display until about 2:30 AM until my friend wanted me to give him a ride home. I dropped him off and came back ten minutes later.  Well, I ended up staying awake and watching the sky until about 5:30 AM because i was so mesmerized and frankly, a little scared.  The same things happened until I went to bed. As a sidenote, I should aslo mention that police ad ambulance sirens could be hear literally ALL NIGHT LONG.  there were non-stop sirens going on for at least 4 hours straight. I don't know if this has to do with anything, though. I woke up very tired and sore in the neck (probably from staring up all night) around 7:00 AM because I had class to go to at 8 AM.  As I was driving to school, I couldn't help but notice that the \"zoomers\" were still there!  Well I went on through the rest of the day until I had to go to work at 2:00 PM.  I had told only one specific co-worker about the whole situation last night because everyone else would just laugh at me.  We waited until it was dark (probably around 10 PM) when I dragged him out of the warehouse that we work at to come outside and see for himself. I pointed out to him one of the clearly moving lights, but he just denied it.  He said it didn't look like it was moving at all. I got kind of upset, but he told me to just go home that night and film the sky because the camera wont play tricks on you like your eyes might.  So I did again, around 11:30 PM when I got off work.  I had a half an hours worth of tape but I only filmed maybe ten minutes of footage. The triangular star formations were still there, and I saw a very fast vapor streak in the sky which seemed to come down straight to Earth about 20 miles away.  After about five minutes (which seemed like an eternity) I started getting really nervous, paranoid, and itchy.  I felt like I was being watched. I couldn't do it any more. I was feeling so weird, I just ran inside and reluctantly went to bed. I woke up today (Friday, June 20th) feeling just fine.  I haven't even bothered to look up at the sky yet.  My friend is coming back in town from his school out in Dekalb, Illinois (NIU).  I plan on showing him tonight and telling him what I saw. We may or may not see something, and depending on how I'm feeling, I may not even care. I have been worrying myself sick these past couple days and these strange lights have given me an unhealthy obsession with the sky. All I really want to know is if anybody else from my area reported similar stories. Thanks for reading.",

I am reporting a UFO sighting that my fiance and I saw while driving to a restaurant on Chicago's NW side (not too far from O'Hare airport). I saw a few light colored spheres in the sky above an airplane and my fiance confirmed it was there. I pulled over on Oak Park Avenue and took her camera to grab some photos. She counted 12 of these spheres, which seemed to be very high up. I was so busy trying to get her point and shoot Lumix camera to focus that I really didn't pay attention to any other detail about these things. I don't know if they all moved in unison or if they were all moving individually. They were traveling North East. My fiance says they may be balloons, so I checked the weather. The wind was blowing southwest at the time. Also, these wouldn't be planes because they were not only too high up but, I really don't think that many planes would be at the same altitude traveling North East (to Canada?). I called 311 (information) to make a report, and they transferred me to the Police. I was sort of embarrased so I asked them to just let the military know what I saw. The spheres eventually dissapeared into the distance and could no longer make out where they were. I have 1 photo of the luckily zoomed in capture of only a few of the spheres which I circled on photoshop with a pen. The camera had an auto focus which, unfortunately, couldn't find the things in the sky to focus on. So, out of the 10 or so pictures I took most were all blurry. I do have 1 picture or two that you can make out these things. I'd be willing to share the photos with someone who'd be able to help identify the objects. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this email. If you can find anything about similar sighting of these, please let me know.",

While waiting in the lobby at AA Gate K-7 at Chicago O'hare my wife noticed a disc-shaped object hovering at an altitude of several hundred feet outside the terminal's large glass windows to the WSW at 7:01 pm.  She called my attention to it and several other people rushed to observe the estimated 30-40 foot in diameter object as it wobbled but deliberately moved to our left (NNE) between Concourse K and L toward the main body of Terminal 3.  It took about 60 seconds to enter and exit our field of view. Its destinctive peripherial protrusions, like notches on a gear, were its primary identifying feature to me.  It was dull gray (my wife noticed orange/rust) with an undulating movement.  It traveled low under the cloud ceiling. We laughed and moved closer to the windows and I told my wife to try for a phone camera shot but she couldn't manage it in time.  Another lady asked \"what in the world is such a big flying hubcap doing out there\".  Others looked and turned their heads in disbelief. Prior to the sighting there was very little aircraft activity in this wing of O'hare.  There was a burst of aircraft activity after the object departed and a large storm moved in at 7:30 pm.  An aircraft appeared to be disabled during the 7:00-8:00 pm period.  Tornado warnings and high winds followed and passengers took shelter in the tunnels of O'hare.  We finally departed on AA 1058 to Orlando from Gate K-15 at about midnight.

I thought about waking my brother up but was afraid that I would wake this thing up.  Then I thought about kicking my brother with my foot and again I was scared I would wake this thing up.  I finally went back to sleep and when I woke in the morning it was gone. I never told my mother or father because I did not think that they would have believed me.

As I walked out the store, I noticed the sky becoming ominous. Looking at the northeast there were 6 circular lights all in formation. They all formed a triangle. Because there were thick clouds forming in the area, the sighting lasted seconds before disappearing behind the clouds.

In all their were at least 10 glowing orbs that all followed a southwestern path and then disappeard.  I do believe in UFO's,but I'm thinking someone set off some sort of glowing objects maybe with parachutes or something.   They came up over the neighbors roof,so i didn't see anything being shot into the air.  It was pretty exciting and my daughter got pictures and maybe video,don't know see is still sleeping.",

      "story": "Strange Craft Descends from Sky in Chicago and exits the night sky rapidly to the North East On 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm CST I witnessed a UFO through my deck sliding glass doorway. I was looking out the window in a north east direction and contemplating taking my telescope out to view the night sky as the moon was very bright in the eastern sky low above the trees. I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia when there was a bright star that began to descend from the constellation. As it descend it got brighter and very large then began to move in a north eastern direction rapidly.  The total experience was less than 1 minute. Background: I often lay on my couch watching television and look out a 6\u2019wide by 10\u2019 high sliding glass patio doorway.  When looking out the sliding glass doors I am facing in a north eastern direction.  My wife and I live somewhat near the O\u2019Hare Airport and are in the direct line of incoming and outgoing air traffic.  So, I am very familiar with aircraft and their appearance both in daylight and dark night skies.  I have seen aircraft flying low and high and feel I can tell the difference between aircraft and what I saw on 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm. 9:03pm 8/26/2010: I had spent the evening noticing how the sky was clear and how the moon was very bright and low in the eastern sky. At approximately 8:50pm CST I noticed a bright star below the moon and wondered if it was a planet.  I took a walk back into a spare room where I keep my 10\u201d Orion Dobsonian Telescope. But as it was going to be too much trouble to take it out of the storage closet I decided against it.  I walked back to the living room and lay upon the couch and was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed that from out of view above the sliding glass door a star was getting brighter and looked as though it was descending directly from the constellation. Over the next few second the star got very large, bright white and began to slow its descent. At this point I called for my wife in our bedroom reading a book to please look out the window, as the bedroom window are on the same north eastern facing wall.  She said she could not see a thing, as I assumed she had alrea! dy closed the drapes as she always does. As this conversation was happening the object had gotten very large and stopped descending. It was at a magnitude I have never witnessed before.  My wife did come out of the room and asked what I wanted her to see, as my request was unusual and I was shocked at what was happening and I think she could hear that in my voice.  I continued to observe the object and it got suddenly got very bright and moved in a north easterly direction rapidly.   When she joined me at the sliding glass door, I pointed out the object and she said \u201cyou mean that star\u201d.  When my wife said \u201cyou mean that star\u201d, the object had already become about an 15th of its largest size and had moved out and away from us. It moved rapidly and then disappeared into the sky in that same direction.  She said it probably was plane, but she had not witnessed the full event. Conclusion: In the two years I have been living here and observing the night sky and passage of commercial planes I have never witnessed anything like this before.  The object I saw was round and moved like nothing I had ever seen before.  It descended rapidly from what appeared to be a small star to a large round object. It hovered for a second before rapidly moving out of sight.  There were no blinking lights on the object like on the commercial craft that fly overhead constantly.  And as this was a clear night I am an amateur astronomer I cannot identify what it was that I witnessed. My only conclusion would be to say that this was an UFO.",

I was looking east at about 9:45pm when I noticed what looked like a lantern with orange flames in it up in the sky.  It was slowly moving NNE.  Then I noticed that there were 3 \"lanterns\" in formation moving NNE at about 20 mph.  I thought they were part of some type of airplane until I noticed that I could see distant fireworks within the triangle formed by the 3 objects. My father's eyesight is not as good as mine and he did not see the objects clearly.  He did report seeing \"dim lights\" but nothing clearly. The objects were moving in the exact same direction and speed.  One object was in the lead and the other two were at the same altitude following.  All objects appeared to be like flames \u2013 orange and flickering. It appeared that the \"flames\" were encased in rectangles.  The objects were bigger than stars but much smaller than the moon.  I would estimate the objects to be 20 feet high by 15 feet wide, at about 500 feet altitude, approximately a half mile away.  The objects continued to move NNE until they were out of sight.  There was no sound coming from the objects. I am a 50-something homeowner and have an MBA.  I have never seen nor reported anything like this before.

I am delaying this report because I am lazy and have been really busy lately. At approx. 22:30 hours, I was over at my friend's house in Mount Greenwood/Chicago celebrating the fourth of July.  My girlfriend, brother, friend and friends sister were in his pool in the backyard making a whirl pool when one of us, I don't remember who said \"WHATS THAT?!\"   We all stopped and looked EAST into the sky.  A ROUND almost flickering object (reddish/orange) was traveling from SOUTH TO NORTH across the sky.  I asked my friends girlfriend to quickly grab my glasses (because I was in the pool still).  My friend yelled for his two parents to come outside. We all watchedas the object just moved rather slowly across the sky...from south to north.... I have been interested in UFO's/flying saucer phenomenon for quite sometime now, but never dreamed of actually being a witness. I payed close attention to this object....trying to listen for any noise or seeing any \"airplane lights,\" i.e. green, red, etc.  I could hear nothing. Now in a matter of seconds the object seemed to head Northeast away from our location. There were no fireworks in the sky at the moment so I ruled out that.  Did not appear to be a helicopter or airplane....the damn thing looked like it was on fire!   I thought it could be a military jet....but its lack of speed/being a weird bright flashy red / orange.....I COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT!  Hopefully someone else has seen it. My friend said later in the evening it appeared again and flew over his house. Scares the crap out of me! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

My mom told me to look out the window to look at the lightning, as she was downstairs looking out the window.  I looked out my bedroom window which is upstairs.  I saw three orange-ish red lights in the shape of a triangle in the southern sky.  They were rotating and gyrating while staying in shape. It was approx. 40 degrees high in the sky.   My mom did not see them because a tree was blocking her view.  My brother and I ran downstairs and outside to get a better look. My parents followed us.  It was lightning and thundering in the distance and as the lightning lit up the sky I saw a black colored center with the three lights on each corner but that was the only time I saw the center.   As it moved across the sky to the west, a forth light approached from the lower left side of the triangle. It didn't appear to be connected to the other three lights, but it was the same orange-red color.   As it came closer to the triangle shape only one of those lights was still vis! ible. Then both lights faded into the clouds.  It was really intense cloud cover with an extreme amount of lighting. We didn't see it again after that.  The whole sighting was approx. 2-3 minutes.  We didn't even think to take a picture of it until it was out of sight.  My mom did try to find our binoculars but didn't in time.  My mother, father and brother all witnessed the event.  My mother made a police report with 911 and reported it to local news stations via emails.   We are curious if anyone else saw it or have pics to prove what we saw.  I had my cell phone in my pocket but was too awe struck to even think of taking a picture.  We were kind of paralyzed by the thought of what we were witnessing.  It was exactly the triangle shape like people describe.  As a family, we are changed forever by this sighting.   We will never forget this night!!!",

      "story": "Golden-Very slow-fireball-something about it was NOT RIGHT!! I was standing on the Belmont EL platform in chicago on my cellphone and I turned just in time to see a huge fire ball moving TOO SLOWLY across the sky.  I instantly posted to my facebook asking if anyome else happened to see it and infact so far 2 people have reported seeing it.  It was about 6 average stars width in diameter.  It was descending at about a 30 deg angle heading what looked like due north and sank behind the rooftops and I lost sight of it.   One of my friends who replied to my status update said they were walking along the beach and their bf saw it but she did not. I am not discounting a meteor but it was moving very slowly and had golden fire emiting from it evenly in all directions and had a tail that looked more like a rocket flame than a normal meteor.  It should be noted I have seen a meteor crash to earth before (within 1000 feet...i know pretty cool right?) and this just struck me as odd. oddities.... the flames were omnidirectional coming out of the object...not burning off to the back like something burning up as it travels through the atmosphere. it had a vibrant gold color to it...flames...ball...tail...everything was gold  it was moving entirely too slowly. it all happened within about 2-3 seconds but it etched itself into my mind. a minute later as i got on my train i saw a police chopper flying by the beaches doing their patrol but who knows what that could have been because they are often there.

On July 4th, 2011, we were watching the fireworks on our highly tuned 40 in. t.v. when we noticed that through the actual explosions, and much higher than the horizon seen ufo, was a slowly moving {from the perspective of the viewing camera} cigar shaped craft lighted on the front and rear, with a group of lights, possibly square shaped, and from camera view moving slowly  to  the left.  This occurrence lasted during a display of what one could describe as flashes of sparkles, through which my wife and I could perceive this vehicle.  I hesitated to inform  the center because concurrently there was a search for a recent drowning victim by a helicopter, but upon reflection there would be little chance of such machine being that high and in reasonable distance from  the explosions.   I have been told  by Mr. davenport to contact the T.V. stations to have them confirm what we saw.",

      "story": "Very large white oval travelling at 300 miles per hour spotted over Chicago I live just west of Wrigleyville on Chicago\u2019s north side.  At the time and date specified I was looking through the south-facing window of my top floor apartment.  The weather was clear with only high wispy cirrus clouds. I noticed an oval-shaped object which was quite some distance away, almost due south (SSE), and travelling westerly, with a color of white much like a cloud.  I would estimate the object to be three to four miles distant, and its size to be at about five or six jumbo jets in length.  Its height was approximately half its length.  The ends of the oval-shaped object appeared to be perfect semi-circles in shape, while the top and bottom were flat and horizontal, much like the \u201cBegin\u201d and \u201cEnd\u201d shapes on a flowchart symbol template. Since I live near Wrigley Field, where the Chicago Cubs play, I first assumed it to be an advertising blimp.  Wrigley Field often employs a blimp to circle the field with a promotional message during games.  But the object was as far distant south from Wrigley Field as I was (at least three miles), and though at first I did not think much of the object, what caught my attention was the enormous speed it would have to be travelling-much too fast to be a blimp.  Using my estimate as to distance and size of object, I estimate the object to have been travelling at about 300 miles per hour.  I will emphasize again that the object was very large. When the westward-travelling object got due south of me it made a gradual left turn and headed due south so I was viewing it end on.  It continued travelling south, but instead of slowly getting smaller with distance it seemed to quickly (within two seconds) fade from my sight altogether, which I thought was strange. Note:  I checked the Cubs schedule and they will be playing at home against the Florida Marlins starting at 7:05 p.m. tonight, some two hours after my sighting.   I went outdoors at 5:30 p. m. to check for an advertising blimp, but found none.",

When I looked up I saw three white strobing lights heading East to West.  They were in a perfect triangle with what would appear to be the flat side facing forward in the direction of flight.  I am assuming that the three lights were on an object, I could not make out any structure between the lights. The object was passing in and out of the bottom of the clouds, although it never became fully obscured.  The MDW TAF says that there is a broken cloud layer at 5000 and a scattered layer at 12000, although the sighting was two hours previous to me checking the TAF. What I thought was odd was that the craft didn't have any beacons or navigation lights.  All I could see was the three simultaneously strobing white lights. There were other aircraft in the sky, there were two helicopters circling almost constantly. For background I am a professional aircraft mechanic and have worked at O'Hare for the past 22 years. I am very familiar with aircraft and their lighting patterns.  This is unlike anything I have seen before. There was no way to tell if it made any sound.  The concert was very loud.",

I stepped out onto my 28th story balcony to see what why the sky was so lit up at 10:30 at night.  I immediately noticed an unusual aircraft at the center of the illuminated sky.  My initial reaction was that it was some new kind of advertising blimp with flashy lights.   As I continued to study the aircraft I realized how unfamiliar and strange it appeared and it seemed to be flying too high above the city to be advertising anything legible. Aircraft Description:  Single aircraft -Extremely bright  -Blinking lights, from white, to red, to blue  -Oval in shape  -Slow moving, almost hovering  -Strange flight pattern, (first moved NE, then came back and moved SW vanishing from the viewpoint of my balcony.)    Personal Reaction to the Sighting:  After staring for a few minutes in disbelief I grabbed my i-phone took two pictures and a brief video.  Called my mom, a few friends, and your hotline. My Background:  I was alone at the time this occurred, I had just come home from Father\u2019s day dinner with my family and was getting ready to go to sleep. I am a 24 year old female,college graduate in Economics; currently working in Finance and definitely not a person who has given UFO\u2019s much thought until now. Seeking clarification on what I saw last night.  I\u2019m fascinated by the possibility this could be an unknown, but I would like to know if what I saw was simply a blimp or some other man-made aircraft. If someone could look at my photos and videos and get back to me I would appreciate it. Did anyone else see this???",

It appeared to be flying low and was extremely fast.   This was in Chicago at Clark and Winnemac while we were walking north on clark street.  It was very bright orange, and larger than anything I've seen before.  We knew immediately it wasn't a plane because we could see two other planes flying in the sky and they were much higher and farther away in the sky.  The planes were a different color- more yellowish/whitish and were moving much slower relative to the orange light.   We stared at it trying to determine if it was a helicopter or plane, but it didn't look like anything any of us had seen before. It was literally a round very bright orange light moving forward very fast.  One of my friends even described it as looking like a planet moving fast across the sky.   We were watching for about 45 seconds as it moved very rapidly across the sky in a straight line then the orange light dimmed, and completely disappeared.   We watched for 5 minutes after the disappearance but it didn't become visible again.    All we could see were the two planes that continued to fly.   We were all pretty confused as to its disappearance because none of us have ever seen a plane that disappeared while flying across the sky.",

I looked up and saw 4 orange globes - three making a \u201cv\u201d shape and the fourth about an arms length in front of the point on the V.  I questioned out loud \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d   They were moving extremely slowly over Lake Shore Drive moving westbound so they were directly in front of my bus.  As I watched one of the three globes move in line and one stayed to my left making the appearance something resembling a whaling harpoon. I continued watching as the globes began to close in on each other.  First one blinked out, then a second.  As I moved the bus around the corner heading north on LSD I noticed the third blinked out.  I had pulled out my cell phone to snap a picture of the globes then realized a passenger was still on the bus with me. As my employer does not approve of cells phones on the job and many passengers will report this I tucked it away into my pocket. As I moved the bus down the street about a block I asked the man whether or not he had seen four glowing orange globes and he immediately said \u201cYes!  What was that?\u201d  I told him I was pretty sure I knew and he said \u201cThat was a ufo!  I live in upper state New York and have seen many lights in the sky but nothing that close!\u201d  I told him I believed there were 4 ufos as they moved independently of each other in different directions.  There was no sound.  Just 4 beautiful orange globes. When I let him off a block later and turned the bus around to go south on LSD back to Addison West I saw a young Oriental girl staring up into the sky watching the last of the orange globes which promptly disappeared before my eyes.",

My wife and I were crossing the street to visit a neighbor when we saw a bright red lighted craft coming from the south to the north.  Both of us thought it was a helicopter at first because of its height but quickly realized that it was making no sound.  There were other aircraft in what I would call their normal patterns heading toward and away from Ohare Airport but this one was lower than all other aircraft and on a level flight path.  It passed nearly directly above us and was was, again, a solid red lit object...no other colors and no strobing or blinking as everyone other craft is outfitted with.   We couldn't tell what the exact shape or size was  but it was larger than a helicopter and smaller than a commercial craft.  It wasn't  traveling at an amazing rate of speed and continued north with a slight curve east toward Lake Michigan.  At the last moment I pulled out my cell phone and snapped a couple of pictures of it  because we thought it was on an intercept course with a blinking plane flying from the east but the pictures just show two light dots...of the red craft and the plane which was decidedly higher.   The red light craft continued at its constant rate and left our field of vision behind the houses and trees to our N/NE.",

In FRONT of the background was a SILVER (shiny and bright) ship looking like a BLIMP, more than a cigar shape. I thought it strange because I did look for wings and there were none.  It appeared to be facing east. I looked away at the traffic in front of me (bumper to bumper) and then looked back at the sky and no more blimp!  I looked at the sky as much as I could from the driver's seat of a car and could not see any blimp.  I did see see a regular passenger plane flying west towards O'Hare about 3 to 4 seconds after seeing the blimp.

I woke up at about 4:10am on 10/12/2012 because Venus and the Moon were supposed to be the closest together on this date. When I woke up, I noticed a third \"planet.\" I thought it could\u2019ve been Jupiter, but then realized it wasn\u2019t located at that point at that time I rested for a few minutes then checked on the third lighted object again (still in the same place). This was in the eastern sky. I got out the binoculars and looked at the third \"planet,\" which turned out to be an aircraft. Just in the sky, motionless. Then it flew south maybe around 4:18-4:20am. There were two-three circular lights on the bottom of the aircraft (white lights) and a sky-blue blinking light toward the back of it. I started to, now, observe the sky with the binoculars and noticed multiple flying objects (which appeared very small) with red and white blinking lights). They might have been commercial flights but seemed to be moving slowly and not so steadily like a commercial flight would. They seemed to also slow down and \"sit\" behind some of the cloud coverage on an otherwise clear night. All in all, there were probably about 10-12 flying objects (but 5 or so could\u2019ve been commercial/international flights). I looked out at the lake now, and in Chicago there are water sanitization stations in the middle of the lake. I noticed two-three objects around one of the stations (through binoculars). The lights did not look like boats (they were not red/green) they were white flashing lights and one had three lights that would light up and down (not as a boat would), and were small. They were out there \u201csurrounding\u201d the water filtration station for 2 hours (until 6am). After that, I don\u2019t know, because I went to bed. At one point, the large brightly lit object (that I had first thought to be a planet) came back, this time from the north. It stayed in the sky and hovered for a couple minutes, then came over my head (I was located in a tall building). It was brightly lit, lights were under the object \u2013 so hard to make out the shape (it seemed to have maybe 5-6 circular white lights on the bottom and a sky-blue flashing light too). However, there was no sound whatsoever. My background includes growing up in Chicago, where I attended good schools. I work about every day, so my sleep schedule is sometimes off. I\u2019ve always loved looking at planets through binoculars and have a natural curiosity toward the solar system (even though that is not my career focus).

We spotted them -- watched for almost a minute and one by one they disappeared.  Weather forecast reported clear skies!  Objects were chaning color, moving quickly in a straight line across the sky. Reportedly from the west to the east. Colors ranged from green, orange, red, white and yellow-ish. Last light seen seemed to leave a trail of orange sparks behind it. It was not an airplane. Flying too low and too close to each other. Def. not an airplane becuase of the space between each object and the formations in which the objects evolved.

We traveled west and as we got to around Cicero I (the driver) noticed a few odd lights in the sky to the left.  They were traveling to the east.  I told mom to look and joked that they were UFOs, but said they could be lanterns.  Then, more lights came and they were all moving in the same direction along the same path.  I thought that they moved too deliberately for me to think they were lanterns, so gave up on that idea.  They may have been coming from somewhere around Midway airport area, but I am not sure.  There are airplanes that fly near the area, but these objects were definitely not jets or planes; they were too numerous, slow and quiet. So I asked mom if she\u2019d mind if we pulled over to look.  She didn\u2019t mind as she was pretty curious too.  We stopped the car and noticed that more and more lights kept moving on the path in the sky.  We noticed that they were round (oval or orb-shaped) and yellow-orange.  Sometimes the lights would pulsate and change color, but not in unison.  They did this individually, deepening into a primary red-colored glow and back to orange or yellow.  Sometimes they would fade out until you couldn\u2019t see anymore light-- but only a gray round object floating in the sky.  The streetlights obstructed some of our vision so we could only see them as they traveled towards us and next to us; as they passed they faded into a light polluted area.  The unidentified lights were about low-cloud height, and could have been the size of a small car, I\u2019m guessing-- I'm not sure how my judgement of this kind of thing is.  We saw as few as 50 or as many as a hundred\u2026 it is hard to tell since I understan! d that excitement can obscure one\u2019s judgment of numbers. I tried to take pictures, but my phone's camera couldn't zoom in well enough and the streetlights obstructed the camera's ability to take in other lights.",

      "story": "Mysterious pink/purple orbs in the Chicago night sky traveling at great speed and high altitude. I was standing outside my house on Chicago's Far Northwest Side approximately twenty minutes before midnight on Father's Day, 2012.  I routinely see two stars on a diagonal line in the southwest sky each evening and, when I glanced up into the sky, I thought I saw these stars in a new position.  But I was in error; the 'stars' were visibly two pink or purple lights, approximately two to three inches apart (using my fingers as a measuring instrument), one directly behind the other.  The lights didn't blink, but they weren't constant, either.  They appeared to pulsate, and the lights were rather dim.  From the moment I first noticed them, their transit took approximately twenty to thirty seconds.  I couldn't detect any shape of aircraft, there was no sound, and visibility was very good - no clouds or other distractions were in view.  Given the precision with which the lights were following one another, I originally thought they might be emanating from one craft.  But the second light suddenly picked up speed and either 'joined' the first light or flew frightening close to the first light as its 'wingman'.  I have no way of determining the altitude these craft were flying but, given the clear night, lack of sound and inability to detect any shape behind the lights, I would assume they were flying at a very high altitude.  And if this is the case, they were indeed traveling at an enormous rate of speed. I live a few miles from O'Hare International Airport, and my family and I are accustomed to seeing aircraft in their final approach and take-off from the airport every five minutes or so almost constantly.   The sky was quite busy tonight with inbound/outbound aircraft, but these hazy pink orbs were not coming from O'Hare, nor were they headed toward the airport.  Their flight plan was very obviously in contrast to any local aircraft traffic in this area, and could very well have posed a hazard to navigation for the surrounding pilots. These were not helicopters, flares, ultralights or any other aircraft known to me.  I am unaware of pink or purple lights used on any commercial or private aircraft, nor am I aware of any FAA regulations permitting such colors to be used within extremely close proximity to the nation's second-busiest airport. I would very much like to uncover exactly what these lights were.  I am a veteran Navy intelligence officer and have two combat deployments to my credit.  I have over sixteen years worth of experience with a wide array of aircraft, and yet I have never seen anything like this before.",

We were in the Lakeview neighborhood looking west.  We were commenting on how many airplanes were in the sky waiting to land at O\u2019hare. I first noticed a dark shape moving low in the sky trending N/NW.  At first I thought the moon had given me a sunspot and my eyes were deceiving me.  I pointed at it and my brother couldn\u2019t see it at first.  It then passed above a street lamp and he saw it as well.  In the light it appeared brownish.  It was closest to being rectangular, long and thin, but instead of the \u201cwingspan\u201d being in the horizontal direction it was longest from top to bottom.  It was very low, appearing to be perhaps ten feet above the 3 story apartments across the parking lot. It flew very steadily and without much change in elevation or speed for about 75 yards before we lost sight of it. There were no lights on it, so I at first thought it may be an owl.  It seemed too large to be an owl and did not ever flap its wings, not to mention it would be gliding in a straight line, completely on its side if it were a bird. From my perspective I would guess the object was between 5 and ten feet from top to bottom and maybe 1 to 2 feet in width.  We had no perception of its depth from our view point, but I got the impression it was thin like a wedge.  It was moving between 10 and 20 mph on a night with winds out of the SW at 2-11 mph. There is a street below, but there are far too many trees for something to be attached to a car on the street or for someone to fly a kite.  There is also an EL train that trends in the same direction as the object moved.  It is unlikely we would be able to see something attached to the top of a train from that distance and viewpoint, but we are close enough to be able to hear trains go by with ease.  There was no train going by.  If it were something attached to the train it would have to be 30 feet or so above the train to be able to see it from that spot. Neither of us are UFO watchers or enthusiasts of any sort.  I liked the movie Independence Day, but that is about as far as I go with UFO\u2019s.  I would appreciate any suggestions on what we might have seen.  My brother thought maybe a large trash bag was blowing in the wind, but he and I agree that it was far to steady in its shape, trajectory and speed to likely be a trash bag.  It also seemed to be going faster than the wind would allow.  A trash bag would probably undulate, while this object seemed rigid.  Any ideas?",

At around ten thirty I let my dog out in the back yard, I was letting her do her business and I was starring at the moon while there was a break in the clouds. I saw one bright orb moving west pretty fast, then I noticed it was one of three in a triangle pattern flying at same speed/ same distance apart. I kept looking up and saw more of these lights. Some came in pairs of two's and a couple more times in a triangle pattern.  Maintained the same speed and kept the same distance apart, also they all moved east to west.  No blinking lights on any of these, no signs of being planes.  I have lived near Midway airport all my life and I know how to distinguish planes.  I was just stuck watching as waves kept coming.  I went up to get my cell phone but the lights were to far to show up on my cell phone camera. I told my mom to come and check them out as we were watching more pairs pass my father came home from work and joined us.  He grabbed his binoculars and saw just a! solid color some were green some were orange.  This went on for at least 15-20 min before the cloud cover became to much, but through the patches and breaks in the clouds I saw at least 13-15 of these balls.  Im not sure what they were but me and my family were just awed by how many kept coming and the frequency.  I know this was the night the big solar flare was suppose to hit us, not sure if this could have anything at all to do with this event.",

Would you please investigate this situation.  I was in my proper fram of mind and this is NOT a hoax.  At least check about the near miss with the two planes.  One plane was on an intercept course towards the redlights.  The lights dissappeared before downtown Chicago.  There was no trail of light.

I stepped inside to retrieve a pair of binoculars that I keep hanging inside the door.  I sighted the object through the binoculars, and it was moving east at a slow pace, coming right towards me.  It was very far away, so it is difficult to estimate its size, but I would say it was just a little smaller than a mid-sized plane.   It was silent, had no running lights, and no exhaust.  As it came closer, perhaps a mile or two away, it started to bank to it's left, or North.   As it banked, I could clearly see that it was saucer shaped in front, but the back end was flat; what a dime would look like if one clipped off about an eighth of it.  I followed it with the binoculars until it disappeared past the tree line.  This is the third UFO I have viewed from my deck in the past two years, and my second report filed with NUFORC.",

I was sitting on my balcony watching the sunset in western skies.  Something dark in the sky caught my attention. What I observed was a v-shaped craft slowly heading east.  It was about the size of a regular commercial airplane.  It wasn't very high at all and I was able to see it clearly. as it passed over my apartment I rushed inside to grab my binoculars and headed to my back balcony.  As I looked thru the binoculars the first thing I noticed was that a dark blue light traveled on the sides of the craft. Then I noticed that it had a slow spin to it.  Which now when I reflect I find very strange.  You would think the craft being v shaped would fly with the nose pointing to the direction it's heading.  This was not the case making it not normal flight.  This craft was hovering and rotating slowly traveling from west to east.  One final detail is that this thing made absolutely no noise at all.  Being that low in altitude it should have made engine noise. I watched it heading north east until i lost sight of it.   live very close to ohare airport and see many planes at low altitudes.  This was not a plane nor a helicopter.  This craft was truly unidentified. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

I saw a light in the sky to the north that looked like a star, but it was much too low in the sky to be one.  It was not moving, so I knew it couldn't be an airplane. Suddenly, the light grew larger and larger; the color was yellow/orange. It sparkled like a star but was equivalent in size to hundreds of stars put together.  It was the brightness of an explosion or firework, but there were no offshoots of light that fell downwards.  The light remained at its maximum size for approximately 20 seconds. It then disappeared. In its place was a dark rounded shape that began to move.  It was difficult to make out the exact shape against the dark night sky.  There were no lights on the top, sides or rear of the shape - only a multitude of small lights on the front of white, yellow and orange that alternated in a random pattern as the shape proceeded forward and down in a vertical east to west direction.  The speed of the object was about twice the speed of a descending airplane and it quickly disappeared behind a distant skyscraper.",

      "story": "Amberish orb 20-30,000 ft above the night sky in Lincoln Park area Chicago, IL Sept' 2009. On Sunday September 13, 2009, at approximately 9:00 PM, I and a few friends witnessed a hovering object high up in the night sky within the Chicago city limits, on the north side, Lincoln Park area. One hour after first spotting this object, I managed to take a picture using my 5MP camera phone with auto flash.  We watched this stationary object just sit idle in free air. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to take the picture because I didn't believe my friends who were outside watching it for an hour.  I stayed inside the house. Object's Position They said that it was a lot closer to the earth before I decided to go outside and view.  So the image I took was basically its very, very slow ascent back up into the stars.  Even though we were in downtown Chicago, it was a pretty starry night with some stratus clouds high up, but the only thing you can see in this picture is the brilliant amber-red spherical object. You don't see the stars in the picture, just the red object.  I tried magnifying the view of the object, but of course it's blurry.  I really need to share this story with someone credible if this helps us understand the big picture of things. Objects Ruled Out I'm not saying that what I saw was a UFO, but I can say that I have never seen any type of flying or floating vehicle, or weather condition, planet, satellite or lightning like the thing I saw that night. I'm so glad I was able to capture it when I did, because I was shaking and tried to grasp some kind of reasonable explanation for what I saw, but nothing came to mind.  I want to share with you my experience and photo if you are interested. This is a real image. You have to zoom to the red speck at the center.  This was taken at my friends place in the Lincoln Park subdivision of Chicago, the night of Sept. 13, 2009 during the Bears/Green Bay week 1 game at 9:00pm CST. This object appeared right around halftime facing the northwest horizon and much lower in elevation.  It stayed stationary, never changing direction.  I finally took this picture at approximately 10:00 PM. Object Hovers  What you see is something I and a few friends can't explain.  Outside the house my buddies were first to notice this thing around 9:00 PM.  They kept telling us to come out and watch this thing floating in the air and not moving.  We didn't believe him so we just kept watching the game inside. I finally gave in and went out to their backyard and witnessed what they were watching.  I could not offer any explanation to what I saw.  The following are things I have ruled out that this wasn't: -No aircraft (blimp, balloon, helicopter, airplane) -No comet, star or planet. -No low earth orbiting satellite Spherical in Appearance I could not decipher any shape of the object.  It looked spherical, and I couldn't tell if there were more than one.  It was definitely higher in elevation than the Sears Tower.  I'd say approximately more than 5,000 to 10,000 feet. My first reaction was to call someone miles away from our location just to verify the same unexplainable thing in the night sky.  Of course, nobody would answer their phone because they were probably watching the game.  I really wish I took video but I was actually shaking, because I was kind of excited to see this thing. It was amazing and frightened to watch.  I still want to believe that it was man-made, but my gut tells me that it's not, nor a natural phenomena",

It can\u2019t be a plane, it\u2019s not moving.\u201d  She was pointing east, from our back yard, at the sky.  The object\u2019s distance from us, had to be less than half a block.  It was clear and visible. We get a lot of air traffic in our area, planes heading towards Midway airport.  We are absolutely familiar with what planes look like at night, as well as helicopters.  I myself am a retired law enforcement officer.   I looked at the object she pointed at and observed the same- this object was not moving.  It was static in the night sky, in a cloudless location.  It had white-red oscillating lights, nothing like the lights of an airplane in configuration.  It was horizontal in shape, and flattened.  I assumed we were looking at it side-on.  If I had to guess, it would have been about the same length as a mid-sized vehicle. We observed the object for a full two minutes.  It remained totally, unequivocally stationery.  The temperature outside had to be in the low twenties, and I seriously doubt it was a blimp or other airship.  It made no noise, as we were waiting to hear if we could detect the sound of helicopter blades.  There was absolutely no noise. After two minutes of observation, I told my daughter to run inside and get my second daughter for another witness.  As my second daughter left, the object dimmed, and vanished.",

It was west of us, and low enough to the ground that I could make out the shape, but still far enough away that much detail was yet to be seen.  I immediately begin to think of what it could be, but the shape, color, and behavior was nothing I have ever seen on any flying object that I witnessed.   The object began to pulsate more rapidly and moving at a high rate of speed, faster than any plane I have witnessed. The object began to move south, and suddenly it stopped in mid air for a good half a minute or so.   Suddenly, it began to speed away, going southwest, and disappearing within a few seconds. I could not believe what I just saw; I am a paranormal investigator with a background in Sociology, and consider myself open minded but very skeptical.  I have read about alien ! and UFO encounters, but never witnessed anything of the sort, so I always wondered about the legitimacy of such claims.

It manoeuvered like nothing we'd seen before, hugging the horizon headed north until it stopped, apparently turned, and flew straight up what must have been at least 2000 feet.  Then it stopped again and appeared to dance around in the sky, just like those chinese lanterns.. . . .  . but Chinese lanterns don't suddenly turn into a rotating trianglular formation.   The one object suddenly split into three and the new triangle of objects slowly spun around a share axis and recombined into one again. That was a fancy lantern!  Then it flew toward us at moderate speed straight overhead, and looked to the other witness like a \"burning butterfly\" in a \"non-consuming flame.\"   I admit I didn't see it so closely as to cite any \"flapping,\" to me it appeared to billow, and puff like something fully engulfed in flame.  I lost track of the object for a moment while moving to another room, trying to get a better view, but when I regained the object directly overhead, it was hurtling skyward at unbelievable speed..like I've never seen.

I awoke to the sound of my television and then turned it off while still lying on my couch.  I sat there for a few minutes and darkness looking at my view of the Chicago skyline when a bright light caught my eye.   My condominium is the flightpath of O'Hare airport and I've grown use to watching planes fly past my balcony on approach to O'Hare airport.  I am also fairly close to the city's medical district and will occasionally see emergency response helicopters fly by my window as well.  However, I've become very adept at identifying types of planes, their altitudes, and the speed in which they are flying.  As the son of a military and commercial pilot, I've spent more than 45 years around airplanes.   This object was flying far too low and moved more fluidly then any aircraft I've seen as it made an ark across the sky.  Its lights flickered brightly, making and arcing tracer as it dissipated in the same manner as a signal flare.   I walked over to my window looking for signs of a tail light and nothing was there.",

Our neighborhood was having fireworks displays and we were watching fireworks go off in sky.  There was a break in the fireworks and all 3 of us noticed a rounded, reddish orange shaped object moving in a straight line from south to north.   When we first saw it, we thought 2 things--it was a piece of a firework, yet it did not ignite or dissolve the way a firework should.  It remained intact and moved mechanically straight.   Second, we thought it could be the ISS which we track sometimes in the night sky through Spaceweather.com, but the ISS was not scheduled to be seen in our sky this night.   We observed the object make a sharp, sideways motion, then it appeared to ascend into the sky.  My daughter captured this on her cellphone.    Approximately ten minutes later, we another same shaped, colored object again moving south to north in a straight line.  This time I told my daughter to go get my binoculars, just in case we saw another one.    Ten minutes later, we saw another identically shaped, same colored object moving again from south to north in a straight line and we visually tracked it this time with my binoculars.  She tracked it approx. a half block through the binoculars into the night sky, continuing in a north trajectory, straight line.  She said it was ball shaped in configuration, no lights on the object.   As I said, we reasoned it could be fireworks, but the movement of these objects were straight line, with one making a sharp straight line movement, and they were not attached to any firework.   Also, they were all ball shaped, as my daughter clearly described using binoculars.   In all we saw 3 objects, all identical.   I am a retired police officer and a trained observer.",

      "story": "Large craft, triangular in the front/middle section, wide across with an arrowhead/chevron look, fading in/out of sky, lights on bottom On the evening of June 6, 2015, around 10:15, I was letting my dog out into the yard and looked toward the sky while I waited for her.   I was standing and looking directly eastward and about a quarter of a mile away and (from my perception) about 20-40 feet above a treeline, I saw an extremely large shape in the sky, very sharply pointed in the middle, which I saw first, and extremely wide and long in its width, which all of a sudden just seemed to slowly appear.  It almost reminded me of a large bulky arrowhead in the width, but the sharply pointed center looked like the two sides of a triangle. In the middle of it, above the largely pointed center, was a round shape that looked almost dome-like or conical.  I could not see the length of it as I was looking directly at it as it was heading west, and just could see the front and width of it.  Perhaps the craft was just super wide and not long in length at all, which is possibly why I did not see its length.  It was moving slowly, not fast at all.  The middle portion (triangle dome-like center) looked a bit lighter than the rest of the craft.   As I continued to stare at it \u2013 pretty much frozen and afraid to blink - I then saw what looked like a hot sidewalk effect, for lack of a better description, or a waviness slowly forming around this thing, and then it looked as though piece by piece I could see through it until it faded or melted into the sky, almost as though it was camouflaging itself in the night sky.  If I hadn\u2019t been looking in that exact direction at the moment I did, I would have missed it, despite it being so large, because of the way it sort of fit in with the sky.   As it got a little closer, I noticed light from underneath it but then I also noticed that it faded into the sky more and the shape became sort of lost or not as discernible as it had been.  What did become more discernible, though, were the lights.  By the time it was nearing my home, I saw one larg! e circle with about 15-20 red globes of light within the circle.  I sensed that the lights were underneath something, but the object was not discernible around or over the lights at this point.  Everything looked just really dark.  But I knew it was there and I sensed it was there.  The lights seemed low, perhaps 500-600 feet.  It was silent.  The circle of lights then moved very slightly in a northwesternly direction over my house.   At this point, I became afraid and grabbed my dog.  I ran from the back door through my house to the front window as it faces north, to see if I could follow it, but when I looked at my front window it had disappeared.  It was just gone.  I did not go back outside. It is difficult to judge by measurement the size of what I saw without using the words huge or large.  If I stand in the same spot where I was standing when I initially saw it above the treeline about a quarter of a mile away and hold up a quarter at arm\u2019s length, then I would have to hold perhaps 3-4 quarters across to cover the width of it at that distance when I saw it first appear in the sky. I live fairly close to an airport (about 30 minutes south) and am very familiar with the sights and sounds of airplanes, whether they are flying high or low, daytime or nighttime, but this was not like anything I had ever seen before.  It didn\u2019t make one sound, and was large.  There are always planes flying in their flight paths over my neighborhood, but strangely enough, there wasn\u2019t one plane in sight during that time or that I could hear.  Just silence. My husband and son weren\u2019t home at the time, and I did not have my cell phone on me when this occurred as I was just letting the dog out and had left it in the house, never thinking this would be happening, so unfortunately, I can only tell you what I saw with my own eyes. After telling my husband and son about my experience, they showed me pictures of a stealth bomber, but it did not resemble what I saw.  They also showed me pictures of Chinese lanterns, but again, the lights that I saw did not resemble Chinese lanterns. This was such an unnerving experience for me.  I wish there was some sort of explanation.  I can only hope that someone else will report seeing something similar on that night  \u2013 it certainly would make me feel a lot better.  And I can tell you without hesitation that this was most definitely not a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

I was letting my dog out into the yard and looked toward the sky, as I waited by the door.  I thought I saw a large triangular shape in the sky in the distance coming from a southeastern to northwestern direction, but it almost looked camouflaged by the night sky.   As it got closer, I saw round red balls of light moving closely together, perhaps 10-20.  I watched it come directly over my house and it did not make one sound.   I realized the lights were underneath something, but as I said, it looked like it would fade in and out of the dark sky or was camouflaged by the sky.  I felt like I didn\u2019t want to take my eyes off of it.   After I let my dog in, I ran through the house to the front door to see if I could follow it toward the west, but it had disappeared.  I live fairly close to an airport and always see and hear planes in the sky, whether they fly high or low, but this was not like anything I had ever seen before.  It didn\u2019t make one sound, and was large!   My husband and son weren\u2019t home, and my neighbors weren\u2019t in their yards.

Sailing due South 4 miles East of Navy Pier area. 15mph West-East wind, clear, unlimited visibility, 2-3 foot waves, 85 degrees.  Aboard a 32 foot Beneteau 321 with full roller furling main sail and genoa out, sails over the port side of the boat filled with wind on a broad reach, sailing at approx 4.5 knots 2 crewman aboard in the cockpit.  Dead ahead, at an indeterminate altitude, at an indeterminate distance both crew saw what appeared to be a silhouette of an aircraft traversing due West to East across the bow of the boat.  The object appeared roughly in the shape of a Cessna 172 or a Blackhawk helicopter.  No sound was heard.  The object was moving in a generally downward angle and disappeared from view as it passed across the center line of the boat and became obscured by the full Genoa sail.  The helm was put hard over to starboard and the boat slid into near irons as both crew searched the sky and water for the object.  Nothing was seen in the air in the general vicinity of where the object's path should have taken it or in the water had it continued downward.   Both witnesses agreed that what they had seen looked remarkedly like the outline of a small aircraft but without any distinguishing features.  It appeared to be a uniform dull light brown or khaki color.  If it was a small aircraft then by its size not only should the witness have been able to see distinguishing features but its N number should have been observable.  The crew conducted a brief search for debris using unaided eye sight and binoculars and considered issuing a Mayday to local marine law enforcement but decided not to since they could not definitively state that they had witnessed an aircraft or that if it was, that it was in distress.   Guessing, based upon the total impressions and information at the time, it was speculated that what had been seen was some form of craft that was using some form of technology that interfered with visual observatio! n.  Some sort of technology that reduced the observable contra! st of it s surfaces that would normally be apparent under unaltered observation.  Also, there was no form of exhaust or contrail or light associated with the object.  It looked like a dull brownish \"blob\" on a trajectory, no sound, or other distinguishing feature with a kind of trailing \"tail\" structure attached to what would be like a cockpit area on a Cessna 172.

This was a mass sighting in downtown Chicago of all places. It went viral on Facebook almost immediately.  Some crafts were seen flying close to the ground in downtown Chicago. Pictures were taken and possibly video as well.  What makes this especially unique is that parts of Chicago were cordoned off with roadblocks/traffic diversions.  The police, FBI, and military were there coordinating efforts as these objects were chased by planes and helicopters around the sky.  The areas initially involved also became permeated with men in black suits who were seen talking to the feds and were walking around everywhere. Then the police decided to tell everyone that it was just lightening which nobody could possibly believe.  Thousands of people on Facebook took to massive threads.  Some of the pictures posted disappeared from FB but some were saved by others (Some of which are friends of mine) before hand.  I don't know if this was on local news but it should have been.  The local police/feds/military response was unprecedented.  This is not a hoax. I believe the objects were orb-like.  The pics I saw were of three lights in a triangular shape, though I could not determine if they were a result of one craft or three.  I would have to go back and sift through a massive amount of posts to get more details on the craft(s) and will do so if contacted.  Please only release my first name.

I'm guessing at the end it was maybe 15km high and barely visible as it was just a dot until it disappeared into the clouds.  This was not a plane, nor a helicopter nor a balloon.

We arrived early to the game, and having my Canon DSLR camera with me, I decided to walk around the bleachers and take some photos of the crowds both inside and outside the stadium.  As I walked behind the bleachers in left-center field, I took a photo of the people gathering on the rooftop of a building on the north side of Waveland Avenue.   Four days after the game, I uploaded the photos to my computer and was intrigued by what I saw in the photo of the rooftop crowd.  A fuzzy glowing object was in the sky in the distance to the north.  It\u2019s a bit difficult to discern a definable shape (perhaps several interconnected spheres?), but hopefully some type of photo-enhancement software might bring it out better.  I noticed nothing in the sky when I took the photo.  The night was clear, there was no blimp present, nor did I see any nearby small planes or helicopters.  There was a slight breeze from the northwest, and I did see jet airliners to the north following their usual flight path from east to west to land at O\u2019Hare International Airport.

I was looking eastward from my balcony, and the light appeared to be maybe a couple of miles or so off the shore of Lake Michigan out over the water. I initially assumed this was a plane, but it was definitely stationary so I ruled that out.  Then I figured it must be Mars or Jupiter because the object had a reddish hue to it and was relatively low on the horizon, but after checking a star gazing app, I confirmed both Mars and Jupiter were in opposite skies from the object.   Next, I assumed a Chinese lantern, but this didn't seem likely from the start. The object was extremely bright and looked like a flickering flame. There were very strong wind gusts on the night of 10/17, so this object remaining stationary for an extended period rules out the lantern because it certainly would not have sat still given the strong winds. I went about my way and checked maybe 30 minutes later and the object was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

It was moving rapidly to the West, and died out slowly.  We were not able to tell where it went though, as we would of tried to find it.  They were assumed to be \"Chinese lights\", but they can't be.  They were moving too fast and specific to be them.  There was also no wind.  Also the fact they were always the same height from the ground and all moved at the speed.  They would come from the same place, and move down the same street.

      "story": "My wife and I were in Chicago and we witnessed 8 orange/red/bright spheres slowly going overhead.  I am ex Navy and stationed on the USS Midway back in te mid 80's.  I worked on the flight deck identifying aircraft so they could set the arresting gear for the correct plane landing (I know my aircraft) - you use the color and shape of the pylons on the aircraft to identify it.  This was way slower and way lower than a regular plane would fly. It was much smaller too.  Perhaps 800 - 100 ft up and maybe 20' - 25' long.  Listen, they were on a flight pattern almost right above, not in complete uniform but close.  The 3rd or 4th one was right overhead in fact my wife grabbed my arm as I joked that if these are real UFO's one might beam me up and she was deathly afraid that it might. I got to see inside it pretty well.  It looked to me like the outside was opaque (see thru) down the middle inside was a dark (spine or pencil) running the length of it.  Imagine the top 3rd of a Christmas tree looked like the propulsion as it was glowing, mainly orange, red. It looked like it was on file but a controlled fire that never got out of control.  Heck, I did a lot of research and many say it's those Chinese lanterns.  No, waaaay to big and at the end. First 3 or 4 came, than the other 4 about 5 -7 minutes later.  There was also the 9th UFO? that stayed out a distance that never came to close to recognize the color or shape.  You see, I like fairly close to O'Hare and the flight pattern is pretty similar location and we were seeing lights and after a while they would get closer and you could make them out but the 9th UFO? never got too close or on the flight pattern of the regular aircraft. It was close, I mean close enough and closer than the videos I see on you tube for me to see inside and make it out really well.  Funny thing was it was a rather calming experience.  I mean if you were to tell me that I would see a UFO I would normally be afraid and here I was looking at what I think were UFO's and I wasn't scared.  Like I said I went underneath and said \"go ahead and beam me up!\"  I just never felt that it was threat to us. I believe it was unmanned?  Not sure if unmanned is right word there?  Anyway, I believe it was just gathering information. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Hi Peter, Not many clouds in the sky as it was pretty clear on 8/20/16 in Chicago. The altitude of the few clouds were at least twice that of the ufo's. I don't know how to triangulate altitude but I do know from just checking google images of pictures from 1000' altitude that that is really close to the height (perhaps less and 800' is probably closer). Our location seeing this was Hermosa Park. If you do a quick google or view of the park we were in the field between the baseball field and the playground. The formation came from the baseball field to the playground which is from West to East (Lake Michigan is due East). I just wish like a computer my memory from this event could be accessed so you could see what I saw.. I did some research after seeing this (after checking to see if I could find other reports about this particular incident) and found this to be the closest thing to what I saw - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc2ppoJIexY. The only difference was my vantage point. We were probably 3 times closer than his view, right underneath the flight pattern. Crazy thing to me was after researching the internet was seeing so many reports of similar sightings. I would've just brushed these people away myself before this happened as I'm a see it to believe it kind of person but I can tell you I'm a believer now! I really not sure how to contact the local press about something like this but myself or my wife are not afraid to say what we saw. We are very straightforward people with no agenda so if I'm contacted I will talk but I'm probably not going to seek out any press myself. I'm willing to continue any dialog about this Peter, as I'm still so curious as to what this was?!  Let me know any thoughts or if you have a similar report from others.  This happened in Chicago on a Saturday night in the summer in a busy area!!!  Someone saw something that we did I can tell you that. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

I was on a class trip from Chicago to D.C., and upon our arrival home back to Chicago at 8:11 P.M. is when I saw it, at first it was simply a couple of lights moving ever so slightly fading in and out but then more lights arrived towards the right side of my window.  (Note that the lights were very far away so I do not know the size or if this was a physical craft or simply a light.) more and more began to appear and I managed to capture all of it on my IPhone 6S. According to my Iphone, the location of the video begins at Coyote Run Golf Course, before my landing at Midway International Airport.  There is no sound in the video and this may be because my headphones were plugged in at the time because I was watching a downloaded television series.  Although I don't know if that is the reason, I beleive it to be that it was the result of my faulty headphone microphone. My friend, who I told the entire experience to wanted to see the video but I couldn't send the video because it was to big to send, so he insisted on me posting it on YouTube which I did, in case anyone had any questions about my video who wasn't my friend I put all the basic information in the description. I do not have any explanation for the aircraft I saw, this was a UFO because this wasn't my first sighting, I had another sighting down the street from my own home, (26037 Whispering Woods Circle).  I don't know if they are connected to me in some way or if it is simply an improbable coincidence.  I ask that you respond because I too research and soon investigate UFOs and other paranormal and supernatural phenomena, I am no fraud I simply think that I should report this because I believe that my story along with everyone else's have a right to be heard. ((NUFORC Note:  We first posted this report on March 10, 2017, but we did so, without having spoken with the witness.  We have attempted to reach him via telephone, but have not been successful yet in speaking with him.  We are uncertain as to whether the report is a serious account of a genuine sighting, or whether it might be an attempt to submit a hoaxed report.  The duration of the sighting that was indicated by the witness makes us doubly suspicious.   Also, when we first posted the report, we inadvertently overlooked the fact that the witness had included his name in the report, which we now have deleted.  The oversight was our fault, a result of our dealing with a daunting workload, at the time.  PD))",

My sister and friend were horsing around but I stayed put by the railing looking at them all of a sudden something made me look up I can't remember what it was but when I did these bright intense lights that I can look directly into without blinking floaters or watering of the eyes was right above me approximately 6 ft and I could see the craft it was so huge that only a quarter of it was visible the rest was stretching over multiple apartment buildings and over mine as well.  It was soundless and chrome but I couldn't see a! ny doors or markings on it only the bottom.  All I remember was looking down after looking at it for about 2 to 3 mins but it seemed longer then back up and it was gone without a trace.  The odd part about not only seeing such a thing was that it was never mentioned nor thought of not even with eachother until years later so Idk whether or not they abducted me and erased my memory.  I also have a lump/ ball in my right upper arm that's never been checked. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "a sentient animal that looked human, with no eyes but a mouth with flatter lips stood at the foot of my bed as I awoke. I opened my eyes, in the old master bedroom of the house with the addition.  It was the first bedroom up the stairs.  At first I was looking up, but saw something black by the foot of the bed but off the left, actually on the side of the bed of me, and not actually at the foot, but sort of a little closer than the foot.  I looked at it.  It looked almost exactly human, and I assumed my family was playing some type of prank of me with a black suit and mask, probably my brother.  This creature was actually quite tall, taller than a normal human.  But the mouth was flesh and had no lips but sort of a creased structure.  The eyes, I thought were covered, but this creature didn't have eyes.  It was just a head with a mouth and it stood, analyzing me through it's head.  This must have been the way it sensed things.  I looked at the clothes, still thinking this was a costume of my father or brother's to scare me.  The animal had a black suit.  I looked at the detail of the ski! n, and saw that it was essentially faceless, but with a bald head.  A man wearing black, but without eyes and a flatter face.  I exited the home within 15 seconds.  My bed was close to the door, which was open.  And the front door was right down the colonial stairs.  My parents put about 1,000,000 into that house, the museum house I called it.  They were once offered 2,000,000 for the colonial home with a large back addition and a fourth floor.  Maybe whatever decided to stop saw the largely lit building that didn't look like a normal house.  On the 4th floor, there was a typical colonial roof that was extended with the addition and about 6 sky-lights.  They were usually brightly lit from the internal lights, like patterns to the sky.  When we built the addition, we also found this energy piping leading to nowhere in the open land behind us.  The builders said there was something they couldn't comprehend about it exactly, and we decided to bury/ignore it.  I sometimes wonder if we had ! followed it, was it just a bunker from a War that the original! house owners had built?  Why was there power and metal lines running to a field from a house that was over a hundred years old..  I ran outside the home that day, partially naked, screaming the whole way.  There are other details such as seeing a female, and also skin markings but I don't want to go into these because they'll sound like I'm fabricating.  This experience was really just contact. I meditate and try to connect with the peace in the universe.  I'm not really sure if these other sentient beings can feel energy from people, but it seemed like it was observing me from the side of my bed. Hopefully a nice, enlightened creature, not something menacing.  I didn't ever see that man, as I think of him, again.  And I looked up japanese lore, and it said noppera-bo, a vision of someone about to betray you.  Or perhaps a visitor with an alternate transportation device that we don't comprehend.  I think that this being, was sensing and probably used the natural universe on a different level that me, because without eyes, there must have been some other type of sense that kept him almost at a respectable distance from my bed.  If he was any closer, I would not have gone off that same side of the bed.  I'd probably have rolled around the other side and gone out the balcony screaming.. I'm not sure.  But both of us were close to the door, and I am happy I got away. Maybe the screaming let him know I was uncomfortable..  I feel like he let me leave.  I feel like I could have been stopped since the stairs were quite steep.  I went from the top landing, right outside by bed and where I dropped my feet, down the stairs, and outside.  I recall feeling safe, inside my chest and body once I got to the street and looked back at the house, not seeing anyone and seeing cars/ I believe at least one person.  I don't actually remember what happened after the street.  I think I got in contact with my family somehow, I don't recall this was in about 2010, but as early as 2008.  This creature, was not human. Afternote: I wrote about some markings! on my skin, but deleted them because that evidence, I thought, would discredit this account. I have been getting these unexplained white dots on my skin, like a scoop removed and then this white transluscent almost skin grows over.. healing kinda fast and appearing out of nowhere.  The two dots were on my abdomen, then my leg, and there have been others that appear elsewhere, like my forearm.  These are more recent, and I'm sometimes wondering if the contact was peaceful, or if I don't know what's happening when I'm sleeping/being accosted.

      "story": "Craft stationary over highway during high traffic Spring (maybe April) 2008 or 2009 Near O\u2019Hare airport, heading east, towards Chicago, on I-90.  My wife, daughter, and I had just returned from a trip to Florida.   The car was parked in the airport\u2019s long term parking and the sky was clear.  It was probably around 5-7pm, so still light out.  We had just left the winding highway roads around the airport and were driving east on I-90 towards Chicago.  Directly in front of us, in the distance, I could see a low, bright light over the highway.  I remember thinking, \u201cInteresting that that plane is flying directly in parallel with the highway and so low.\u201d  I assumed it was just an airplane lined up to land at the airport and that it would quickly turn off from the seemingly straight path it was taking above the highway.   However, as I continued to drive, it seemed to continue its straight path directly towards us.  I mentioned something about it to my wife, but she didn\u2019t seem interested (I think she was distracted on her phone, maybe texting her parents that we were on the ground heading home).  As we got closer to it it remained in ! place, and I remember thinking, \u201cWow, that is low!\u201d   As we got closer, I noticed it was not moving but stationary above the highway, with cars zipping along under it in both directions, as if nothing were there.  As we drove under it, I looked up, leaning up a bit to look through the windshield in front of me.  As we passed under, it was approximately 20 feet above the highway, and it looked as if it were man-made.  By that I mean it had large pipes, or ducts, and other mechanical-ish type looking parts.  It must have been huge as I only was able to see a small part or section as we went under.  After this, the strangest feeling happened.  All of a sudden, I had this feeling of elation and felt as if I was the best and cleverest driver in the world, with the ability to quickly, and without effort, maneuver the car in and out of traffic like a pro (almost felt like flying).  I think I looked back in the rear view mirror a couple times as the light diminished as we drove further from it.  Afterwards, and over the last many years, I still go over it in my mind and am still mystified by it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Security camera sighting over O'Hare International Airport I live just east of O\u2019hare international airport and recently setup a security camera pointing almost directly west overlooking the airfield sky.  I setup the camera to only record motion (free 14 days of motion recording) and let it run. The next day I decided to check out some of the night time motion triggers thinking that I would get another racoon/skunk sighting. Instead I got something that I can't really explain. I first checked a recording at 5:09 AM and noticed that the usual insect tripped the motion.  Upon further inspection of the video, I noticed 2 small lights in the sky.  I rewatched and noticed that they were hovering slightly.  I then started going back in time about every 20 minutes or so and noticed that the 2 lights were roughly floating in the same position.  I kept going back in time (about 4 hours) to 12:47 AM to see if I could find where the lights entered the frame. The lights appeared above the treeline and rapidly moved up and over to assume a position where it remained for over 4 hours hovering slightly. It looks to me as a pair of 2 lights connected by something, probably the aircraft, and moved in unison. Feel free to access the Google drive folder below for most of the videos recorded and a \u201cline of sight\u201d map of the camera:  https://drive.google.com/open?id=17Xh_F7DNv-a8kILooFX_BsEIe2fE6akU ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, I see the lights in the sky again and it seems like it is some sort of infrared guidance system for the planes to land. Obviously, it can only be seen with a IR security camera and the video from 12:47 looks like they were doing some sort of calibration and then bringing it in line for the planes to land.  Very sorry,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

      "story": "Red light seen over Lake Michigan from Chicago over Sears Tower. 30-40 minute. Color changes too My wife and I were on our rooftop to watch fireworks on the 4th of July 2018. We have a clear view of The Sears Tower (Willis Center) which is about 2.5 miles away.  I noticed a red light, a bit brighter than what we typically see on top of building or tall antenna for aviation purposes. We also could see that all the buildings had their own red light(s) on top for identification purposes.  The thing that I noticed very quickly was that this red light was above the Sears Tower beacons by a long shot and was no way a part of that buildings antennas. The red light would stay solid for about 20 seconds then off for about 2-3 seconds, back on for about 5 seconds, back off for 2-3 seconds and finally stay on for 20-30 seconds.  This process lasted about 10-15 minutes.  Then the light moved in a completely straight horizontal motion, did the blink sequence and moved back to where it was.  It then moved in a completely straight vertical motion down above another building, eventually moving back up.  These movements were not fast nor slow but for the distance we were viewing from the movement was probably in fact very fast. At the end of this viewing the light switched from green to red and back to red several times and also did a white light blinking sequence for about 5-10 seconds before finally staying red.  These color changes all happened while sitting in one spot at a time.  We finally decided to leave the roof top because a large lightning storm was approaching and the winds were very strong.  In fact we could see the larger fireworks being blown northeast into the wind quite dramatically.  That was also very strange to see this light not moving with the wind as a drone or helicopter might. My first reaction was a helicopter but I have never witnessed a helicopter move in right angles so precisely.  My wife suggested a Drone but I don't believe a drone can stabilize so well in 20-30 winds and if I had to guess this light was probably 3k-7k above the lake.  From our vantage point the light would have been closer to southeast Chicago or possibly even Indiana. When we got back into out apartment I was excited to get my spotting scope set up to look at it but of course it was not there nor did it reappear for the next hour or so while we stayed awake.",

It was not a sign being pulled by a small plane, as I would have certainly seen the plane on such a clear day.  The object was moving in a very steady, deliberately North to South and a steady pace. Imagine a flag waving in the sky, but it\u2019s transparent, and because it\u2019s waving, the transparency is a little distorted.  That\u2019s how I was able to make out its shape.  I looked out  my driver side window to make sure it wasn\u2019t simply my view through my windshield.  It was not.  The object was still there.

If it wasn\u2019t going so fast I would have tried to take a picture or video but then again it was so dim so it might not have been captured. This was just after sunset and there  was lots of ambient light. I would say it was definitely faster than the jets during the air and water show. Any! one facing west and looking up would have seen it, it may have been dim, but it was brazen, unmistakable and unmissable for the two seconds it took to fly from one end of the sky to the other. There were aircraft in the vicinity but none chasing the object, which I imagine to be impossible.

      "story": "I was on a commercial jet on final approach into Midway airport near Chicago. We were Over Lake Michigan at approximately 1k feet and I saw what I thought was a white bird Like a seagull flying above the water going in the opposite direction as the plane. As it got closer I noticed that it was not a bird but rather a white ball shaped object flying at a steady rate. There were no propellers or any type of exhaust or thrust producing mechanisms. It just moved under the plane at a steady rate. It\u2019s difficult to determine an exact size because it was below me and appeared by be ~ 20 fee above the water. If I Were to guess I would say 2-3 ft. in diameter. I have never see a UFO in my life, I\u2019m not sure what this was but it was very strange. No one else on the plane made a comment that I could hear.",

      "story": "White stationary lights caught in Chicago on a time lapse video My husband set up his phone for a time lapse video in the alley behind our garage as he loaded his pickup truck.  The video shows him loading, then driving away (forgot his phone was on the fence.  After he drove away, the video shows the phone shifted it\u2019s focus up above the garage.  He then returns and begins looking for the phone.  While he is looking, two white lights appear in the sky over the garage.  Even though the phone is still on time lapse video, the lights don\u2019t move and you can see clouds are moving over the lights.  A third light appears briefly forming a triangle.  No craft is apparent - just lights. We are married, have 3 daughters, and two dogs. We both own our own businesses and my husband runs Christmas tree lots - why he was loading his truck early morning.",
