We were driving a mini van.  MY one friend was driving and my other friend was riding shotgun and I was siting in the first row of seating on the driver side.  driving down chili avenue, headed towards the city near Walmart, we were the only car on the road.  We saw a man with an injured leg attempting to cross the road about 200 yards from us.  As we approached the man he stopped in the middle of the road, we slowed our speed to a crawl and as we drove by him we looked directly at each others faces.  He had two black eyes about three times the size of a human, two holes for a nose and a very small mouth.  He was wearing a beanie so I don't know about hair.  We sped off in fear.  I don't believe what we saw was human.",

PD)) orange ball of fire hovering over  Rochester NY area, chased away by another multi-colored UFO The sighting occurred at approximately 3:30 a.m. in Brockport NY (15 miles west of Rochester NY). I was coming home\u2014pulling in the driveway-- (I live on a 40-acre farm) and immediately noticed a very bright orange-haze glow in the eastern sky\u2014when I first noticed the object it was hovering (barely moving) and it was glowing. I noticed it immediately because of the size of the fireball/light and because it was much lower in the sky than any other celestial objects. I watched closely because it APPEARED to be moving, and sure enough, it was moving. The sky was very clear and the stars were very bright and beautiful on this morning. I am a college professor, and I was 100 percent sober. I was so taken back by the object that I woke my sleeping mother out of bed so she could also witness the object with me. I\u2019m 37 years old and am always very cognizant of my surroundings, and I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this. I watched the object for approximately 1.5 hours (until about 5:00 a.m.). The object would hover for about 5 minutes at a time (sometimes more) and then it would disappear by ascending at a tremendous amount of speed. It would then reappear in a few minutes and repeat the same pattern. You could witness a zigzag hovering pattern\u2014it changed directions very abruptly and almost zigzagged while hovering but we also witnessed (what appeared to be) either rotation of the air craft OR lights that were spinning (like a giant search light)\u2014we could see the light going back and forth. The object we watched was orange in color and very bright\u2014like a ball of light. Towards the very end of the sighting, we saw another object that was very different in shape with multi-colored lights (including red). The object was completely different in shape---not round but more like the shape and light configuration of a traffic light looks like. It did not look like an airplane because the rate of speed at which this 2nd object was traveling was incredible. It almost appeared as if the 2nd object ! was look ing for\u2014or chasing the 1st object. Eventually, the orange glow ball object disappeared (as if it was being chased away). I was facing east toward Rochester and the 1st object disappeared into the south-eastern sky. The multi-colored object moved in from the north-eastern sky and disappeared in the north-eastern sky. When I first got home, I observed the object from outdoors. I did not hear any noises associated with this object. It was not a helicopter and it was DEFINITELY NOT an airplane. As the object appeared to be getting closer, I ran indoors because I was scared! For the remaining time, my mother and I observed the object through the east-facing windows of our house.",

When we got outside again, we looked over to the South and noted another one of these light orbs in the sky along with the previous.  They were now moving in a direction towards the west.  My guess of altitude would be below 1,000 feet.  The light was constant, non fluctuating, and almost looked like a source of light on the bottom of the object radiating upwards to the top.  There was no noise associated with it, and the movement was steady.  No trails were noted.  The first object moved to the west of the sky, and turned direction upwards, and slowly faded away, the second object then followed to the same area and disappeared slowly.  I then looked back at the origin poi! nt and noted a third light of the same exact description follow the same path and again disappear. We live in the approach path of the International airport, so I have been seeing and dealing with planes in the sky for all of my life, however this was not a plane and there were no identifier strobes seen.  This was not a flare either, as it had a more orange hue than a flare.  There were no sounds of fireworks in the area as well.  When I attempted to look through the binoculars, the objects were fuzzy and could not be focused on. I stayed outside for a duration of ten more minutes after this event, and nothing else was seen. The path of these objects must have been a mile to three miles in length.",

      "story": "Christmas Eve object with bright spotlight near Rt. 441 in Wayne County near Rochester, New York like a helicopter with no sound It was Christmas Eve and I (41) was telling my daughter (13) to get ready for bed at 10PM in a small town about 20 miles east of Rochester, NY in Wayne county.  We were in the worst part of a windstorm with SW winds sustained at 34MPH (54KPH) and gusts to 62MPH (99KPH).  As she was finishing up brushing her teeth I took a look outside to see the trees swaying in the high winds and saw an aircraft in an unusual position in the sky. Living outside Rochester, which has an international airport, it is not unusual to see planes, mostly incoming, approach from the east, headed west along New York state route 441 which later becomes Elmwood Avenue and leads a nearly straight line to the Rochester airport.  On this night, however, the aircraft I saw was at least a mile north of route 441 and had a spotlight similar to those I saw on police helicopters when I lived in Los Angeles.  It also had blue and red lights, but the spotlight was most noticeable. I opened the door to get a better look. My daughter, a firm believer that UFO\u2019s are not real, saw what I was looking at and her exact words were \u201cIs that a UFO?\u201d  I told her it looked like a helicopter.  However, within a minute it was nearly overhead and we couldn\u2019t hear it.  Its\u2019 speed was much slower than most planes, and the spotlight (which was pointed toward the ground, but slightly to the right of its\u2019 flight path) was very bright.  The speed and the spotlight seemed to suggest that it was a helicopter, except there was no sound. The object continued past our house where it seemed to pick up the path of route 441-west, towards the Rochester airport.  My daughter captured some video on her cell phone but it was captured through a closed window and appears to be a speck of light in a dark sky when viewed.  The flight path, the red, white and blue lights and the speed all seem to point towards a helicopter, or maybe even a small plane flying into a 40- to 70-knot headwind. But why would a helicopter be using such a bright spotlight? There were no police chases here that night.  And, its\u2019 speed was faster than any possible police chase on these curvy, hilly roads.  It traveled at least 5 miles in about 2 minutes. And it was at a height of several thousand feet, too high for the spotlight to illuminate the ground.  It was cloudy and windy, but no fog or rain or snow to explain the use of the bright spotlight.  I also considered the possibility that an aircraft had landing gear trouble. To both of us, this seemed like it might have been a UFO and it might have been a helicopter with a bright spotlight.  It is possible that the wind was howling so loudly that it drowned out the helicopter sounds.  This sighting was unique enough to get my un-believing daughter to think it might be a UFO.  I\u2019ve seen much stranger objects, back when I lived in the Hudson Valley region of New York State; objects the size of football fields that moved unlike any aircraft, and this sighting does not come close in comparison.  The object we saw, though, is still unexplained as far as we are concerned.  We are also aware of the obvious implication of seeing something unidentified flying across the sky on Christmas Eve night, but for now we\u2019ll just call it a UFO. At the time of the sighting, we were at 43.15 degrees North, 77.34 degrees West looking East initially, then South, and lastly Southwest as we lost sight of it.",

This places it over Lake Ontario. The light was a white-yellow, slightly larger than the visible stars at the time.  It moved at a constant, blazing speed, from northwest to south.  It appeared too far out in space to be a satellite and traveled too fast.  The object did not burn up or gravitate towards earth, but continued in a straight line through space.  In about forty-five seconds it had covered the entire horizon and faded away.   I've never seen a satellite behave in such a fashion and if anyone else noticed this event, I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until I noticed the sky started to get brighter and bluer.   Just as I was thinking \"huh, that's weird,\" a blue ball of light soared over the clouds low over my backyard, from east to west.  I didn't know it was a ball of light until it went over a part of the sky where the clouds broke up.  Right after, there was lightning.  I tried to think it was just part of the lightning, but the object in question didn't flash, just glowing and passed over swiftly.  It didn't make any noise.  It had an aura about it, and emanated light all around it, but you could tell the shape was spherical.  I just sat there with my jaw dropped.  I kept trying to rationalize what it was.  I entertained the thought it was a meteor about to hit the earth, and sat there waiting for the ground to shake.  Nothing happened, though.  I stayed outside for 15-20 minutes waiting for something to happen as if to explain it.  I have no idea what it was that I saw.  I only know that it was an unidentified flying object.",

We were going home from a friend\u2019s house after watching a show together. The time was approximately 12:30 AM. Almost immediately, I saw two bright orange balls of light in the sky, diagonally north of where we were driving. I yelled for her to pull over. We quickly parked in a parking lot facing the objects, in front of the Towpath Hotel. We jumped out of the car, and at that time, a man in another car pulled into the hotel and parked. We did not get his name, but the three of us watched this phenomenon together. These two objects moved at a very fast rate, independently, in all different directions, around each other, then they suddenly stopped and seemed suspended, parallel to each other. They were large and appeared to be at about the height that a plane would fly when descending. My friend took a picture on her cell phone. After a couple of minutes, the ball on the right very slowly seemed to recede and disappear. After it was completely out of sight, the ball on the left slowly receded, on a parallel path to that of the first one, until it disappeared. The three of us talked about it briefly, with all of us agreeing that they could not have been lights or aircraft that we\u2019ve seen before. My friend and I felt thrilled to have witnessed such an event, as we have never had this happen to us before. We both have our masters degrees; I am a fifth grade teacher and my friend is a computer programmer. Last night, we bought the book, The Phoenix Lights, and agreed that what we saw looked exactly like the orbs on the cover. We are curious if there were other reports from our area or other locations on that day.",

Even closer I could see that the object was indeed not moving and was just hovering 20-25 feet above the center lane of the highway, about 1 mile north of the Lehigh Station Road exit.  I drove right under the object, and kept trying to stare at it until it was above my windshield and I could not see it anymore.  It was metallic and may have even shined in the sun light.  Its shape was almost like a rounded jacks piece, or one of those hand-held massagers that has the three prongs at the bottom.  I immediately called my friends to explain what I just saw and that I would not have called if it was not something I thought was important.  I later contacted various news stations in the area, and they confi! rmed with me on September 21, 2010 that at least one other had seen a shape similar on September 20, 2010, and that two city police officers had also seen the object.  over the weekend in an adjacent county (about 30 minutes west) witnesses claimed that there was an object hovering over the highway and cars were actually pulling over because they thought it was a plane trying to land on the highway for an emergency.",

I walked around the firehouse to check and make sure everything was locked up and nothing was out of the ordinary.  As I turned the South West corner of the building I noticed a bright light approximately 10 miles away directly west of the firehouse. I watched this light for approximately 15 minutes trying to figure out what it belonged to. I was figuring a helicopter until I compared the object with a stationary object close to me.  That is when I noticed the object was moving from left to right approximately 2-3 miles at a time in less than a minute.  The object continued doing this with-out ever dimming, so I was able to dismiss the bright light as being a landing light on the front of an aircraft. Since the landing light would dim as the aircraft turned away from me if it was circling something. After 45 minutes of watching this light moving left to right and occasionally up and down I noticed the light seem to be moving away from me, West.  With-in 3 minutes the light had moved a great distance away from the original spot where I had first witnessed the object.

Driving northbound on Rochester road at Hamlin (see attached map), I saw about a mile ahead of me two VERY bright, yellow-white lights close together.  The lights were very different from the street lights, car lights, and building lights in the area.  All those lights looked washed out compared to the floating lights.  The floating lights were also significantly brighter and larger in diameter. At first I thought they were landing lights from a plane flying really low.  As I approached I realized the lights were stationary and then thought it must be lights on the end of a high pole - perhaps they're having a carnival in the parking lot of the mall again.   As I came to a stop in the left-hand turn lane at Rochester and Avon, It was about 20 or 30 yards away (west and slightly north) and about 4 stories up... and still not moving.  I keep thinking to myself, \"I can't be the only one seeing this\". The thing that stood out most was how I had traveled a mile with this thing in full view and it never appeared to move at all.  No wavering, nothing, even when I was right next to it. It was just hanging there steady in the same spot. At this point, I could make out a third light, and the three lights formed a triangle, but I could not see anything between the lights at all.  I pulled out my iphone and shot 3 pictures, but only 2 came out (not very well, either.  I have an iphone 3g so it's not HD). After about 10 seconds it started to move south.  It didn't accelerate, it just started moving at a slow, constant rate.  As it moved over the parking lot to my left (west), I could CLEARLY see its shape since the ground lights were illuminating it from below.  It was a triangle with equal lengths on all sides and appeared to have no markings at all; just a flat, \"grayish\" surface with lights on the each end.  I could not tell how thick it was.  As it moved, the lights faded to nothing over the span of about 6 seconds and then I couldn't see it at all even though it was fairly close. FYI, it was raining slightly and there was a slight \"haze\" in the air. This may be unrelated, but when I crossed the road two miles back  I saw four police cars with lights and sirens blaring as they drove through the intersection of Rochester and Auburn roads.  Two continued west and two turned south. Additional notes:  The lights on the craft barely show up on the photo although, to my eye, they were really bright, glowing balls of a diameter larger than the parking lot lights.  Strange that they barely show. Also, the lights were constant the whole time: no flickering, pulsing, etc. until they shut off one-by-one. I can't emphasize enough the strangeness of how this thing was just \"parked\" in mid air.  It was just hanging there completely still. Friends have been asking whether it made any noise.  I didn't hear anything but since it is a busy intersection I'm not surprised.  Although, you'd think if it was a jet that I would have heard a loud, high pitched noise, but I didn't. Also, the three lights were not underneath the object but appeared to be on the sides.  I couldn't tell how tall it was because the lights didn't reflect off the black surface. In retrospect, that's pretty strange too.  And I don't remember seeing the lights reflect off anything in the environment, but I probably didn't notice because I was watching this thing so closely.",

My husband and I both said they were just towers, as we were near the airport.  But then they started to move and get closer and we knew they were not towers. Every few seconds more would float up until there were about 20 to 30 in the sky. We pulled over into a nearby plaza to get a better look and try to get some pictures.  Several other people had pulled in to look at them too.  One guy yelled out his window to us \"what ARE those?\"   We answered that we had no idea. The objects were completely silent. They left no trails.  They looked like orangish-reddish fire, they flickered, but it was clear that it was not aircraft lights (like red/white of planes).  Also they didn't appear to flash uniformily like a light bulb would.  It looked more like the flickering of fire. After a while the lights started to flicker out.  But my husband then pointed to where one of them was and we saw that we could still see something moving against the sky, it was just completely darkened.   At that point there was a commercial jet in the sky and they were moving about twice the speed of the jet. But before, while they were lit up, they were moving much slower. All three of us are college educated, upper middle class.  My sister is 25. I am 29, and my husband is 34.

It was too much like a fireball. It didn\u2019t leave any kind of streak or trail.  It was almost like something was burning up while entering the atmosphere.

It was a solid bright light, no blinking lights, no trail, seemed to move a bit erratically on path.

At this point the object stopped tracking to the east and held stationary for approximately 5-8 seconds, then began to move in a northerly direction at a slow speed, paused, moved north again, moving faster and stopped again. The object moved back after that in an east to west direction at varying speeds, pausing at times, sometimes making abrupt sweeping curves and coming to sudden stops, then beginning to move in slow, small movements for short distances, pausing and moving again.

I lived in a rural area with my closest neighbors being a mile away.  The road I lived on was a dirt road not very often traveled by others. It was a warm night in November (for Indiana) and there was no wind at all. It was a new moon so it was a great night to go fox hunting so I got my shotgun and red head lamp and started to the field.  I had to cross two triangle shaped fields, one was approximately 500 yards by a quarter mile the 2nd field was approximately 300 yards by a quarter mile. As I stepped into the first field I looked up and saw two red lights about 100 feet apart.  I knew there were two radio towers in that direction so I did not give it any thought.  It was about midnight and very dark so I did not look up again until I entered the next field.   When I did look up the lights had changed directions.  The lights had made a right turn and now were crossing in front of me heading south at a very slow speed.  The craft was over the fence row that separated the 2nd & 3rd fields.  The field I was entering was 300 yards across and the craft was about 200 feet up. When I saw the craft it scared the hell out of me.  I got behind a big tree and turned my light off. It was a still night and the craft made no sound at all.  It was 80-100 feet across and shaped oblong with two red lights on the outer edges.  I saw no windows or any other lights I watched from behind the tree for 15 minutes or more, the craft seemed to stop once and then moved on.  When it got to the long end of the field it turned right and slowly moved off out of sight. I stood there for a while trying to decide what I should do go hunting or go home.  I was 24 and needed the money so I went hunting.  I went into the third field and set up in the middle on top of a hill.  As I sat there not able to take my eyes off the sky I saw another craft a mile or so away.  It was also going very slow and was zig zaging between the houses.  I watched this one for an hour and a half by that time it was close to 2 AM.   I decided to give up on fox hunting and go home for the night.

I seen one orange object floating in the sky traveling quite fast coming from the West and traveling to the East.  I didn't think anything of it and thought that it was something to do with the fireworks or even possibly a plane.  A few minutes later, I seen 3 more orange balls traveling the same speed, they were lined up one after thee other, a bit of a distance apart and were also traveling to the East.   I was with 5 other people at this time and got there attention and to our amazement we seen a plane fly through the sky at the same exact time and then we knew for sure that this was no plane.  My brother said they could have been Chinese lanterns, but seeing how fast these orange balls were going, each following the same direction and path, and moving at various speeds...we counted the Chinese lantern idea out.  The objects were orange in color, round in shape, looked like balls of fire gliding through the sky.   After seeing about 3 more sets of the orange balls follow the same path within a few minutes in between each set, we decided one person would Google it and 2 other people got out telescopes.  My brother was assembling the telescope and the balls continued on and then as soon as he had the scope ready to go they all of a sudden stopped.  I would say that we seen around 10 of these fireballs in total.  If anyone has any ideas what they could be or similar stories please get back to me.

It had a very bright green glow and seemed to flicker.  It was above 70 degrees above us and was the size of about 10 stars.  We were facing south when we saw it, and it traveled east.  To make sure it was not just a stray firework, we watched it travel and saw it go extremely far off into the distance.",

      "story": "Transported to a beautiful world with benevolent beings   My experiences are always an extremely vivid dream, and I have had multiple follow up dreams as well.  Every fiber of my being tells me that my experiences were real.  I am not a ufo enthusiast by any means, and have always believed abduction stories, for the most part, are the result of an overactive imagination or mental/physical disorders.  Here is my story:  The first time I had the experience, I never experienced the actual abduction or saw any kind of spacecraft.  All of the sudden, myself and maybe four other humans were in some kind of adminstration building with windows all around, with a huge table in the middle of this stainless steel like atrium.  We were all terrified, and scattered to find a hiding place;  we had no idea how we got there, or who anyone else was.  We never saw the alien beings either!  Me and another human male hid in a closet.  There were no words spoken the entire time, not sure why.  All of the sudden, I wasn't afraid anymore, and ventured out into the atrium once again.  I walked to the big table in the center of the room, and some kind of a being or presence was showing me, telepathically, the secret to faster than light travel and their alphabet.  I was amazed, no longer afraid, just...awed!  Afterwards, I was lead, telepathically, outside of the atrium to their world.  It was beautiful beyond my ! imagination:  two suns; one brilliant blue sun on the horizon and another red sun on the other horizon.  The world around me had a desert coloring to it, but there were strange plants in the distance.  I was telepathically told that my time was up.  It is at this time that I woke up in my own bed, feeling like I had been blessed by god.  I was able to draw some of their alphabet, but had no idea what it meant.  I was also able to recreate the diagram for faster than light travel.  This experience has stuck with me throughout the years.  The second time I had this experience, I suddenly found myself looking at the beautiful horizon with the two beautiful suns.  I wasn't afraid at all, but so humbled and excited that I was back!  Once again, I never saw the alien(s), but was able to understand, and realize that there were several beings near me, that meant no harm.  It is like someone was speaking over a radio directly into my brain.  Once again, I am unable to speak with my voice, but these beings must have been able to read my thoughts and emotions, because I got a tour of this facility.  As I am walking through the atrium, I notice the ceilings are over 30 feet high, the walls curved and there were no straight lines.  It was all a stainless steel looking structure.  Very interesting!  I walked past glass window, where I saw hundreds of human bodies suspended in some kind of clear solution with one tube going into their abdomen.  The tube had a florescent liquid flowing into each human's stomach.  I was hor! rified.  The being told me, telepathically, not to worry.  These were just generic shells that they had created through genetic replication many years ago.  The human shells that they had were devoid of any soul or spirit that made us human, and had no awareness whatsoever.  The alien then told me not to be afraid once again, they have no intentions of harming any human being, only a fascination and a need to experiment.  The only time they deal with real live humans is in a controlled and friendly environment with no intent to harm or frighten.  All of the sudden, in my mind's eye, I saw a small town just like any here on earth.  There were humans, happily living out their lives in a place that was created by these beings.  Almost like a scientific zoo, but the humans were blissfully unaware of their situation.  These were genetic reproductions of actual humans from earth that they created to learn everything about the human race.  Once again, the being reiterated that not a single human was harmed, and that these humans were farmed there strictly for research, and were able to live their lives to entirety without any intervention from these beings; these brings were merely there to observe, not interfere.  Once again, I was suddenly outside of their facilities, gazing on the horizon, admiring their two beautiful suns.  I awoke, once again, in my own bed, with that same feeling of awe and being blessed with what I was able to experience.  I was astonished to have what seemed like a \"follow up\" visit, like these beings are making sure to take it slow, not to overwhelm, not to frighten, just to make contact with real earthly beings and share some of their culture.  I believe that the biggest thing these beings were trying to show me is that they are real, they have been making contact with humans for thousands of years, and were proud of their experiments.  Kind of like a \"hey, we are here, and there is no reason to fear us, let us show you!\"  I have not had another experience since the second one, which occurred in 2010.  Nothing even close.  I am not afraid that it will happen again, and I hope I do experience it again.  To me, it is almost like seeing the benevolent face of god.  These are truly good and beautiful beings that are reaching out.  It has been a life changing experience, for the better.  I hope that my story helps others and that others have been able to visit these beings.",

At twilight at 7:42 to 8:02 on 09/17/2013 I viewed a single white circular light in the southwestern sky, hovering, about 30 degrees of angle.  3 miles west of Rochester, Wa. 98579  There were no engine sounds. Upon zooming in, you see through the white light, to what looks like a spinning, Chinese lantern. When zooming further, now orange over all, with circulating red/yellow/green illumination around the outer circle. Enough detail was viewed revealing a wheel-like structure, radiating spokes into the rounded center. At this time I drove southwest to the town of Rochester, approximately 2 miles from original sighting area. I noticed I was physically closer and appeared so in my viewfinder. I took video of this at this time. Object slowly moved high in the southwestern sky (now dark) and was stationary at a 50 degree angle. There it remained. Taking note of it's position, I drove home. Approximately two hours later, I observed object high in sky, appearing to be the same object seen earlier, evidenced in my viewfinder. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD))",

In the evenings following, I saw the same white lighted craft hovering in the western horizon.  This time I used my camera to sight in and took several pictures on the zoom setting which didn't allow for clarity, but still allowed detail.  It revealed a spherical dome shaped craft,apparently self illuminating.  It had a rounded center making it appear to be like a wheel of a car,hubcap in the center.   These objects displayed no usual marker lights, or engine sounds. In the week of these sightings I witnessed approximately 6 sightings, and all appeared to be the same vehicle.

Also it as completely dark, no lights on the craft,and it didnt make any noise.  I watched the object as it was still slowly moving forward towards the four-way stop. When the object reached the intersection, it was now completely visible.  It was grey, looked like a plane, size of a plane.  The object stoppped right in the middle of the intersection, so now i am at eye level with the object  The object then changed its shape, and turned into a star, it glowed a bright red, orange and maybe yellow, then the object changed its shape again to a really small round craft, and took off into the sky so fast headed toward stars.  I followed the object with my eyes,in secounds it was gone dissapeared in the stars, there was a line of smoke in the sky and within secounds that was gone too!  Back in 92-94 I was a pre-teen I did run home and tell my mother, whom absolutly believed me.

Then just like that the lights rotated again into one but this time it was dead center and just ! diapered.  I stood there dumfounded not understanding what I just saw, but I do know what I saw.

I immediately noticed a bright light in the west about 20 degrees up.  It was flickering, i knew it wasn't a star.  I got the binoculars and saw it had flashing lights, red, white and an occasional blue  or green.  A few times a bright beam of pinkish light shot out to the side.  The light stayed in one spot except that it occasionally moved a hair sideways and back, or in a small circle.  I couldn't get the binoculars to focus sharply on it, although I can focus on the craters of the moon or a jet at 35,000 feet.  After a while watching I sort of decided that it was in a triangular shape and was rotating. I walked down the street to get a better look.  At the top of the beach i noticed another light, same deal, out over the lake.  This was not like any of the lights I've seen out there.  When I had a clear view of the sky I saw that there was another one low in the northwest, like over toward Toronto. About 11:15 all three were suddenly gone.  They didn't move away, they went out. I came in the house and was heading into bed when there were five bright flashes in the southern sky, like a flash going off. There was never any noise from any of this.  The flash was bright enough to throw shadows of the trees into the room. In the middle of the night, around 2:30, wife said \"I can't sleep...aliens\".",

My friend screams out the car windown nothing happened, we turn down this dirt road and all of a sudden boom it's gone..  But the most scariest interesting part of this whole entire thing, earlier that night at my friends house this sound I could not explained occurred, and lights flickered, and all of a sudden her basement door was open.  Them animals in the house became terrified.  I felt this weird feeling in my body, I wasn't afraid I was expecting them, but something was in her house.  We called the police thinking maybe were crazy and someone waist had broken in, the police found no evidence, all if the cabinets were open, all of her art supplies were open in the cabinets, the bar downstairs fridge open.  Then the sound stopped right when the police came.  Twenty minutes after they left we got in the car, drove around..  And saw what we had seen\u2026",

It was strobing, then it would stop and go very bright, then strobe again.  It was a white/yellow/orange combination of light. It was just sitting there in the North East just above the tree line.  I ran into our house and got my wife, she came out to the front of our home, watched it with me for about 30 seconds, then it moved to the North. We could no longer see it from the front of our house so we went out to our back deck and was able to see it just over the trees. It was very, very bright, moving funny.  A little to the left, then up, then back.  After about 2 to 3 minutes, right before our eyes, it vanished!  At this time our daughter came over and wanted to know what we were doing, we told her what we saw.  After about 5 minutes of scanning the sky, BAM, it repapered right where it had vanished.  It seemed much brighter, moving a bit erratic and strobing faster.  After about 2 to 3 minutes, it moved up and to the north, then in a second vanished again.  We watched for another 10 to 15 minutes but it never came back. What we did notice is that after about 20 minutes after in vanished for the last time, there were a number of airplanes!!  We did not see one in the sky while we were watching the \u201cUFO\u201d, but after we counted at least 8 in the sky over and around where we saw the light.

I noticed it was in the shape of a bird soaring and it was moving slowly towards the east.  It was moving about the speed of a plane and after about 3 seconds it disappeared behind a cloud. I just tried to shrug it off until a few seconds later I saw another farther down the sky and another flying very closely by it.  One disapeared as if into thin air and the other disapeared passed the clouds.  As the clouds moved I saw a few more come into view,a few at the same time and a few going faster before disapearing. I kept looking up for about 30 minutes; I didn't see anything else but I saw about 7-10 of these flying lighted objects within 5 minutes.

I was standing in my yard and as I looked to the sky I saw an bright orange orbs hoovering and suddenly began zipping around the sky with ease and precision, I ran back into my house frantically trying to explain the situation to my brother, who took his time getting outside, but sure enough the orb was still out there. By time I thought to turn on my camera phone, I was only able to capture about ten seconds of footage before the Orb shot out of the atmosphere.  As me and my brother starred at each other speechless, no more than ten seconds after the solo Orb took off, four of the exact same orbs slowly rose up from the tree line, in a semi V formation,  and seconds after slowly rising  all orbs simultaneously began again, effortlessly zipping through the night sky both side to side and up and down. As the multiple Orb feat was so astounding, when I attempted to capcapture more footage with my cellphone, I unfortunately forgot to press the record button,due to over excitement. Therefore, the initial single orb sighting is all I was able to capture.",

Just based on the brightness of the light and the fact that it was sitting stationary in the sky,  I immediately pulled out my phone and started filming.   I then watched for the next 12 or 13 minutes as this thing blew my mind.  It appeared to be square, or diamond in shape.  It changed from green to red then back to green in no real pattern.  It did not make a sound.   It traveled from one side of the city to the entire other in under 10 seconds.  It dropped so low that it was out of my sight for a few minutes, then rose as if someone had a string attached to it and yanked it upward.  I would say 1,000 feet to 10,000 feet in under 3 seconds.   As it got close enough to me to really make it out I could tell the body of it was black, there were four huge perfect circle lights on the bottom, two red and two green, but at times there would be either no green or no red.  I also saw a flashing white or maybe even amber colored light on the back?  Maybe front?  I am basing the size on a passenger jet which flew through the same vicinity as the craft moments after it disappeared which I also caught on video and I would say that it was half to 3/4 the size of the airplane which was a full size jet plane.  It also appeared to be traveling 15 to 20 times faster than that plane which was descending to land and much much higher.  This happened in Rochester NY and I witnessed it from the suburb Greece, NY.  It was mostly south of my location, but at times traveled far enough north east (in under 10 seconds mind you) that I had to turn my whole body and face Irondequoit, NY, which is east of Greece, to keep recording it.   I stopped a passing car and asked the young lady to look up and tell me what she sees so I know i'm not going crazy and she watched it for about 5 seconds, said oh my God that's a ufo!  I said thank u for confirming and she promptly pulled away as if she was nervous.  The craft made a lot of erratic movements.  Stopping on a dime, zig zag patterns at times, shifting as if on an axis.  At one point it started heading right at me and had me nervous enough to start walking back towards the apartment building for safety.  It was acting as if it were investigating or searching for something.   Truly a life altering experience for me, felt absolutely nothing like a drone which is the infamous explanation i'm getting for this.  I own a drone.  I know what they can do.  I know there's a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and uses for them.  This was not that.   Oh and I don't know if this relevant or not but I experienced a really bad headache about an hour after the event which would not go away to the point that I had to take tylenol for it.  I NEVER EVER have headaches that lead me to have to medicate.  Cannot remember one time in life.  I don't know if it was just from all the excitement or what.",

      "story": "no noise, unusual beginning On Sept 25, 2012, I was taking image of Braddock Bay, Lake Ontario, near Rochester, NY, when I noticed what I thought were fireworks being shot near the lake.  They didn\u2019t come from the ground, but raised up fanning out and arcing downward in 4 whitish lights which then faded.  This occurred straight in front of me, approx. 1 to 2 miles in front of my line of vision.    They started this pattern 90 deg South (to my left), and each time they repeated the same pattern until the fan of lights (4) were facing me and kept rotating as before moving from my left to my right.  There was an interval of between one or two seconds before each rotation.  It was at that point I decided to turn my camera in an attempt to capture this phenomenon. I was shooting 6 images of the same scene, shooting one f stop apart to later combine them later in a process known as stacking.  The images were shot in raw in which the camera shoots and records the data without any changes or modification.  I used a Canon 5d mark II  which produced images averaging 27 mp each.  I still have the raw images saved in which you can see the 4 yellowish discs in the horizon. As a result of this in the two images included I saw that the pattern had stopped and they were visibly flying in a North/Easterly direction to go over Lake Ontario towards Canada.  I have included a small version of the entire image and the magnified part of the image. Image 1  count from the right of the dock in the distnce to the third light to the left and you can see the small light in the sky.  Shot at 7:13  PM  (time of the 6th shot in the series)  Image 2  the light in the sky is more visible and you can compare the movement.  Shot at 7:15 ( again the 6th shot)  As for the light conditions the sun is setting and is behind and to the left of the 4 discs therefore the light is being generated is by them.

It started with one light, redish/orangish/white hovering over the horizon while me and my friend were parked on my road, facing east.  I live on the east outskirts of Rochester.  It was staying in the same area but floating, dipping, and swooping around.  You could tell it was far away.  I pointed it out to ((friend's name deleted)) and she saw it too, and it proceeded to swoop around and dip up and down erratically.  We both saw it moving.   I was really excited and made her drive closer to where it was.  We drove closer, heading east until we weren't really in Rochester any longer, more Buckhart area.  I lost view of the light on the way.  When our view became clear again, we parked facing the side of the sky we saw it in, the south east whole sector of the sky.  I couldn't find it and then I noticed it in a different part of the sky, much higher.  We watched this light dance around for awhile.  It moved in ways impossible to any technology we have.  ((friend's name deleted)) saw it too.  We were watching the one light fly erratically.   Both of us keep thinking we glimpse other similar lights moving but aren't sure.  The one light is flying over the horizon at a steady speed in one direction, then it slowly fades away and seems to dissappear.  Another (or the same) light pops up much higher in a totally different direction in the sky.  Then we both saw the second one.  Same color of light, same behavior.  I was ecstatic.  At this point it was clear that these could not be planes or helicopters.  And then they kept appearing--they just kept popping up.  These different lights, all the same color, all differing moment to moment in brightness and dimness, sometimes becoming so dim as to be invisible. They all flew the same style--drunk alien, but never in sync; they would swoop, reverse directions in an instant, dip up and down.  There were no formations to be seen or apparent organization.  Sometimes the speed of their movement was shocking, given how far away they were they had to be covering huge distances in an instant.  Some would move in a general direction, but erratically.  At one point I could have sworn a fighter jet was pursuing one of them, but I couldn't be sure and ((friend's name deleted)) didn't notice it.  I tried to keep count and I got to 8 before I couldn't count them due to the number and the extreme dimness of some of them.  I kept trying to explain it to ((friend's name deleted)), but I don't think she will ever understand how much of a big deal this kind of shit is to me.   The sky was alive with dancing spaceships. We were there for maybe two hours. I could not stop watching, it was like being in a trance.  So I was watching the dance of the spaceships when I noticed a light in the sky coming from behind us (high, moving from NW to SE toward the spaceships.  It was different-- bigger, and blinking one light and one color in steady pulses, and moving at a steady speed and direction.  I assumed it's a plane but I watched it because something seemed odd about it. It's not like a light ON it is blinking, it's like the entire vessel is blinking.  And the color is like an old yellow light, like the color cast by old light bulbs.  I notice in between the blinks it appears to glow a very dull red.  It changes directions and comes in towards the ships.  I watch a spaceship closest to the incoming big yellow light and the strangest thing happens, the spaceship seems to become aware of the new interloper, and it swept towards it and back in a few motions, and then IT STARTED BLINKING BACK AT THE SHIP.  And both blinked differently, like they were shaking hands or trading information of some kind, with different rythyms and frequency and color.  This was the first time we saw any of the fireballs blink.  They blinked a bright white.  Then the big yellow ship came in closer to the other ships and slowed down to a stop were it hovered and bobbed.  As it did this, two more spaceships swooped in close to it and began their own unique blinking response.  So clearly it was another UFO, but different from the rest.  After it delivered it's message or whatever it flew away (SE to NE and seemed to go higher than any plane ever could) where it seemed to become a still star.   At this point, I couldn't take it and I called my dad to make him come outside the house and try to see what I was seeing.  This was also a really strange aspect.  Once my dad came outside, the brightest of the spaceships all started blinking red and white, like airplanes.  They also chose a general direction and stuck with! it, though their speed fluctuated.  It was funny because they all blinked with no rhythm or steady pulse to them.  Long story short, all he sees is airplanes of course.  He goes back in and I get off the phone with him and the ships go back to normal and start moving more.   At several points, I made reference points by holding up my thumb or my phone still under the light in the sky, this was an easy way to see that they were moving relative to the motionless point. I can't explain what I saw, but we saw it and it was amazing. A two hour dance that started with one little light. GROUND SIGHTING, AS WE LEAVE:  [A NOTE: we did not see any ship approach the ground or come close to landing] Right before we leave a big solid white orb light maybe a hundred yards behind us floods us with light.  I sa,y \"What the fuck was that?\" because it disappeared quickly and Kaitie said a car.  But the light hadn't come from the road.  It was directly behind us, close to a house on the other side of the road.  Then we were getting ready to pull out, and it floated out from behind the house.  My first impression was it was just someone with a light, but it was much too bright.  And it floated. It glided.  It came out from behind the house and started coming towards us.  We're talking the brightest white light you've ever seen, on the other side of the road not 70 yards away.  Then it's gone. Two seconds of darkness ... and then it comes back on-- except it's glowing blood red now, and more dim because of the duller color of the red.  There was no indication of anything producing the light. I was a little scared and we drove away, leaving the red light back there. That is the end of this report, but I feel the need to mention what happened the next night from my bedroom window. Kaitie was there again:  Over the cornfield in front of my house around 11 PM two lights hovering over the ground appeared and acted erratically.  One was bright and white, much similar to what we saw so close to us on the ground.  The other one was orange, and very odd at first appearance.  It looked to be a bright orange ball constructed of paper with a fire blazing inside of it.  It acted the most erratic in flight before both became almost entirely still.  They stayed until day started to come, and as the light of day  grew, they receded into the distance until they were tiny pinpricks, and then nothing. I have no pictures but if they come again I plan to walk up to them and try and take a picture/just get closer.

      "story": "HELLO at approximately 21:30, my fiance and I were sitting on our deck.  We had looked up at the sky and seen this bright amber colored fire type light.  It had to be about 25-35 feet above tree level.  We really got us is that after the first had gone by a second one had past about 2 minutes later and then a third about 2 minutes after that.  All headed in the same direction to.  NOW I know it was not a Chinese lantern because of its speed and it's  pretty windy for a flame to stay lit!!  Can't stress this part enough.  On top of that there was absolutely no sound.  We don't know what it could of been, but got our attention enough for me to look up what it could of been and ask questions.  This is my first stop to post this. ANY suggestions?  It was only one color to that amber fire color, so this has me baffled!",

      "story": "A large black triangle with three lights that hovered around us for over 2 hours. A solid object that made no sound. My daughter and I went out to view the Perseid Meteor Shower late on Thursday, August 11, at a small park in Rochester N.H., and while we were looking overhead toward the South we spotted a small light moving slowly in all directions.  As we watched we realized it wasn\u2019t moving away from us.  After a few minutes we realized it was shaped like a triangle with a bright light toward the front and two dimmer, green-tinted lights in the back.  We also noticed that there were very faint green lines forming the triangle and connecting the three dots.  It was a solid object and the lights never changed distances from one another. The movement did not resemble a helicopter, airplane, satellite, drone or anything we had ever seen fly in the area before.  It made no noise that we could hear and it clearly had nothing to do with the meteor shower. It in no way looked like a shooting star.  Sometimes it moved quickly to the left or right.  Sometimes it moved forward in the direction of the brightest light and then backed away in the direction of the two green lights.  However, it always remained above us with no real pattern of movement. We were in an open field surrounded by trees and it remained above the open area from 11:45 p.m. on Aug. 11, and we left the scene on Aug. 12 at 1:57 a.m. At one point it seemed to not only move toward the spot where we were sitting, but down towards us.  It then quickly backed away again to its original spot in the sky. While it did move some distance, it never left our sight and was almost always directly above our heads. I made phone calls to the Pease Air Force base nearby and asked them to look to see if they saw anything on radar or any other equipment.  However, they said they could only see flight plans and transponders.  The man on the phone said he would look into our sighting further. We also called the Rochester Police Department and they responded with three vehicles.  The officers observed our UFO and somewhat laughed it off, but nicely.  Both the police officers and the man from the Pease Air Force Base wondered if it might be a drone, but I do not know of any drones that are solid, triangular with three lights.  It flew in so many directions for such a long period of time and made no noise of any kind.  In any event, our sighting was documented by an airport and the local police. Through the entire event the object never moved very quickly, but it did change speeds and stop and start again. My daughter noticed that there was a grey coloring in the solid area between the lights.  She also so on the side of the triangle lights, smaller rectangular lights separated almost like windows. This was the first UFO sighting that either of us has ever experienced. We saw no evidence of aliens. All we saw was the object itself. From what the police told me later, they had many calls from other citizens who saw the ufo and one called this national reporting hotline as well. The police also said that Rochester has no drones nor does the New Hampshire State Police.  They also said that the military would have informed them of any surveillance going on in the city.  They had  no military notifications that night. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Here are two of our pictures...Only the bright light in the front of the triangle was visible on the phone camera picture but there it is. We have other pictures but they all look similar. We tried taking video and I'll look at those next as well. Here are the two pictures we managed to get.  ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter,  This is my written report that I put together when I got home the night of Aug. 12.  From what my daughter said you  may not have received it.  The written report that you received, while it was happening, was hers.  She said it was mine because she was embarrassed to put her name on anything.  I'm going to send it in this e-mail with an attached microsoft word document as well.  ((NUFORCE Note:  Witness alludes to report which appears above.  PD)) ((END ADDENDUM #2)) ((ADDENDUM #3 FROM WITNESS)) We first saw it on Aug. 11 at 11:45 p.m. and kept on watching it until almost 2 a.m. on Aug. 12.  If it makes it easier we saw it for more time on Aug. 12.  Hope this helps. ((END ADDENDUM #3)) ((ADDENDUM #4 FROM WITNESS)) I'm really glad to help.  I've never dreamed of seeing anything so weird in my life and I want to know what others think of it.  The thing that strikes me most is that I never heard of a black triangle up to our sighting.  I have since done a lof of research and see they have been around a long long time, before any drones were in the hands of the public.  I truly don't believe that huge triangle was a citizen's drone.  It was something much more.  It was just too big and too quiet.  I saw a video from Concord, NH, with a triangle that was similar to ours, but it was taken in daytime.  There have been so many of these sightings in NH and the East Coast.  Why is that?  Very very interesting and very very strange. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #5 FROM WITNESS)) It was much larger than the moon in the sky above us.  To me it seemed as big as a football field, maybe a few football fields, high in the sky and way above the trees.  It flew higher than the small planes.  It dwarfed the small planes that flew around us all night.  As it hovered over us, we got very nervous, even scared, as it moved lower towards us, almost like we feared it was going to fall on us.  My daughter was making strange noises for a short portion of the 2 hours we saw it.  I also remember my heart racing a few times and my hands were trembling like I had too much caffeine?  My voice was trembling when I talked to you on the hotline, and it was hard to catch my breath.  I had a sick feeling in my stomach, but I was so excited to see it at the same time.  She wanted to leave but I wouldn't go.  I couldn't take my eyes off the thing.  I also forgot to mention that at the end it did move out of the area very slowly to the North and out of our view.  The police saw the tail end of it all.  Actually it seemed to move away more directly when the police cars arrived in the parking lot with their headlights and flashlights aimed at the object.

Prior to this, while driving through Fairport, I had seen a moving object, which looked similar, however I dismissed it as an airplane, as it was flying in the direction of the airport. Shortly after seeing this larger object, I noticed several, I was driving so couldn't really stare at them, but there were a minimum of 10 bright red lights in the sky to the south of the highway, sporadically hanging in the sky.  They were intensely bright and some were moving around.  Visually they looked like a column of red lights there were simply not in a row, and they ranged from close to the rooftops to well into the sky.",

Next: I saw something that looked like a tic-tac come out from behind the cloud and then retract back into the cloud. next the object came back out, but this time there were 2 of these objects, they both retracted back into the cloud and came back out and now there were 3 objects. The first craft (far left) rose to the top of the other 2 forming a triangle. Then shifted down to where the 3rd craft was on the far right. and the other at the other end (far left) rose to the top. then all 3 started rotating in this manner. They moved very fast, then like a rubber-band snapping I saw a flash that looked like a check mark and they were gone.

      "story": "Box-shaped UFO Low to Ground with 2 Red & 2 Blue Lights on Bottom Crosses 490 in Rochester On aforementioned date and time, my friend and I were on our way to a bar in downtown Rochester.  We both were completely sober at this time.  We were traveling in a westerly direction through the Park Avenue area of Rochester on the 490 North freeway.  It was already completely dark outside, except for some ambient streetlight/city light.  The UFO was traveling in a Northeasterly direction at approximately 25mph and we were traveling about 65mph. I first noticed the UFO as we were driving along listening to music.  At first I said nothing as I noticed the object had no flashing lights, which I've never seen before on any type of flying craft.  As soon as I realized this, I said to my friend half jokingly \"look a UFO\".  I pointed it out to him and then turned down the music.  Just as I did this the bottom lights came more into view, and I could clearly see 4 large in diameter lights mounted on the bottom of the UFO making a perfect square.  The 2 lights leading the way were red, and the 2 lights following were blue.  They were very close to the color of red and blue police lights, however they were large solid lights (not beams or spotlights) that did not blink. The UFO flew just about directly over us as I continued to stare and make as many detailed mental notes as possible while my friend looked as often as he could (he was driving).  My friend immediately agreed that it was very strange and that he had never seen anything like it. We tried to go over what it could possibly be, but since there were no blinking lights (which are required by law on all aircraft) and since the speed was so slow, the only possibility I thought would be a police helicopter, except several things didn't fit.  We heard no helicopter sounds at all, and this UFO only appeared to be about 200-300ft above the ground.  I also researched heavily into what this might be, and nothing matched, including the police helicopters used in the area. I  later asked my friend to describe exactly what he saw so that I could get an independent description of the object.  He immediately said it was \"box-shaped\" with 2 red lights and 2 blue lights on the bottom.  I personally couldn't make out anything other than the lights and the square shape surrounding the lights, however I was only focused on the lights, whereas he saw a box shaped object with lights underneath.  Some other information:  the UFO appeared to be about 30ft x 30ft squared on the bottom.  The 4 lights took up all of the space on the bottom of the UFO, which would mean each light had a diameter of about 15ft x 15ft.",

Not a big bright light but lightened up enough to where i was paying attention what started as a single white flashing light far away in the sky kept fly closer as it got closer i could see 3 lights in the shape of a triangle but kind of rounded a light in the middle with a red flashing light hovering the top middle light  i instantly made my boyfriend come and see what i was seeing and he was shocked i stared out the window and seen the same light reappear  in the same exact spot and come by the same exact way starting as a single light and turning into this flying object i looked closer out the window and could see the light where turning side ways and i looked like it was spiriling  i have never seen anything like this before in my life but i witnessed this same event happen in about 10 minute intervals 4 times the same night and so did my boyfriend it flew by the same exact way and the sky was very bright for being so late at night im not a crazy person",

They said it had like a thick tether or rope with what looked like a bunched up couch cushion at the end hanging below it over the neighbor's house. They said they were watching it and all of the sudden it flipped lights on them they said it was so bright it made their faces hot and it scared them so bad they couldn't move they froze.  They then said the parts of it that looked like a crown.  The edges lit red and then it took off. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

She is usually locked up in a room during the night, but the room can be easily opened from the outside by pushing on the door, and my cat sometimes lets the dog out.  I turned around, ready to talk to my dog, and saw a non-human face (grey, elongated features, can't remember the eyes).  It was so alarming that I jumped out of my chair and grabbed an object.  When I turned back to the door, it was gone.  I have tried telling myself that it wasn't real, and I have refused to tell anyone for fear of being ostracized.  No noticeable signs of a craft (audible or visual).  Strange and quickly disappearing scratch marks the next morning (scratches were white in a red blotchy area rather than red).

      "story": "Orb of yellowish light that turned blueish green.   Disappeared and reappeared 3 times in night sky. In the clear Western sky, I saw what looked like a very bright star or planet, but it was more yellow than white and seemed to flicker.  I watched for a minute or two and it disappeared then reappeared. I went outside and took some pictures and video with my phone.  Zooming in it was definitely not a star or planet.  It changed colors and seemed like a light with a glowing aura that changed colors, yellow to a blueish green and back to yellow.  Each time it appeared it would be in the same vicinity, but not in the exact same place.  It stayed in the same place but appeared to me moving in place if that makes sense. I filmed for 42 seconds and it disappeared on film.  I did not move the phone.  Then it came back for a third and final time and I filmed for over 3 minutes zooming in and out to try to get a better focus.  I stopped filming and then filmed another minute or so and it appeared to be moving and fading in and out until it disappeared again. On the 3 minute video, an anomaly occurred that was only evident after viewing it after the fact.  There is one second that something like a cloud or a vapor passes closely in front of the camera, but the orb never disappears in the far distance.  There were no clouds or mist around me while filming so I have no idea what it was. About 20 minutes after it disappeared completely, large aircraft began circling the area where I saw it and I also have some footage of that, too.  The only thing going on that night near that vicinity was the Indian Reservation was setting off some loud fireworks, but nothing like you see on the 4th of July.  It looked more like lightening.  This orb was off to the right a good distance away and low in the sky, but high enough for me to think it was a star or a planet. Most people are telling me it's a drone, but I haven't seen footage of drones behaving in this manner or that were this large. I am willing to share the footage, but I don't see where to upload it to this report.  Please let me know if you would like to see it.

      "story": "ufo followed me home and parked on my property! I was driving home from Centraila, Wa ,about 11:30pm.  I got off I-5, and took exit 88 highway 12 west, toward Rochester, WA. I stopped at the 1st light, and saw what I thought, were weird  light reflections in the clouds, they were pale yellow orbs bouncing all over the sky, my husband said they were most likely from a spot light.  As we drove farther west I noticed that the orbs were just to the south of us about a mile or so and were brighter, and were closer together now traveling a little ahead and to the southwest of us, as we entered the town I realized this was one ship, and the lights were much brighter although still above the clouds, we made a left, and then turned back west on our street, I thought the object was still in town. Our road is curvy, and as I made the second curve,I almost wrecked the car!  I caught sight of the craft just to the left of me and a bit ahead. I almost wrecked the car!  we were the only ones on the road and the object was now just above the clouds, and you could see 6 white lights rotating in a pattern and 4 red lights that spun, then the white lights ran to the inside or center of the craft, made a star formation,then reversed direction and made a circle around the center star like light. This thing stayed in the cloud cover, never coming out into the bare sky, so I never saw the whole thing. As we took a left into our driveway and parked, the craft stopped and hovered, literally, 200 feet above us and 100 feet next to us, just above our pasture. the lights slowed down, and as we got of the car, it looked like it was coming down, by the way it made no noise, had no wind there was no engine noise at all! at this point we both decided it was best to get inside. We got the dogs out of the kennel, and took them in the house, they had been raising holy hell, and were franic!  I decided to go out side and see if the craft had left, it was no longer at the front of the property and I did not see it at first. This made me feel better and I walked out to the street and headed west to see if I could see where it went, as I walked up the road I looked to the left and looked out at our pasture, and saw at least, 25 rays of light pointing up to the sky, they were like spotlights and were bouncing all over the place! the craft was now on the ground behind the barn  so I could not see it, but I knew there were no lights out there like that! I took off for the house  and told my husband we needed to leave, he agreed and we got the dogs loaded and took off down to the next cross street, we turned left to go to highway 12 and the craft went right over us heading due west, and then it just disappeared! I am still shaken up, and just a bit afraid they will come back. A car was parked at the corner of the cross street and  moon road and he had a cell phone in his hand so someone got it on camera,  The whole encounter lasted 30 mins,",

Directly across my front door in the sky was a very bright star like light that was a bright yellow white.  Lower than a star though.  It was in a area of the sky that the planes turn around to land at the Rochester airport.  So my first thought was it was a plane turning around like they do. Again, this unusually bright star was BRIGHT, kinda flickering and in that plane turn around area in the sky right near Lake Ontario. While watching this bright light it slowly faded away and disappeared.  It never moved from its spot in the sky.  At that time I assumed it was a plane turning around but 15 seconds later it slowly faded back to its full brightness.  It did this multiple times not moving from its spot in the sky for about 15 min. I continued to check on it while I was getting ready it eventually disappeared after a hour of this.  I didn't see it leave but was definitely unusual. The sky was clear that morning, no clouds and was still dark. I didn't think to take a picture or thought it was weird at the time because I assume it must be explainable.  When I got up the next morning and went to smoke it wasn't there so definitely wasn't a star.",
