They got very bright then disapper. They almost look like white fireworks the way they disappear but fireworks dont stand still and split and form a line and the lights were silent no sound at all. They were probably a good 20 miles or so. I was looking towards the north. my sister was with me and a homeless man was there in the street bare witness also.

When I went to get tools out of my truck at a house I was doing landscaping at I noticed a round very shiny ball in the sky that was moving up at first then started a steady path up and to the east.  At first it reminded me of one of those gas balloons that are shiney silver, but this was perfectly round and not moving as a floating object would.  It was also bigger in size, but it was hard to tell exactly how big it really was or the exact distance away because of how it reflected the light.  There was no noticable sound coming from it or any means of propulsion. I just stood and watched it for a little while and then walked back to the backyard of the house I was working at and pointed it out to a guy I work with.  He acknowledged seeing it and asked me what it was, I told him I didn't know and we both just watched it continue on the same course for a couple of minutes until it was out of sight.  Because it took so long to get out of sight, I think it was bigger than what I initially thought.  Initially I thought it was very close and about the size of a basketball. I was a Crew Chief in the Airforce and have seen many different types of aircraft.  I also have a pretty good knowledge of physics and the principles that would be involved to move an object like that, and admit that it had to be something that I can't explain.",

I had just gotten of work and was walking out of the Glendale Galleria; it was about 7:25. A work associate and I were standing outside on the 3rd and top level of the Glendale Galleria North west parking structure talking. It was around dusk and I happen to be facing South-west when something in the distance caught my attention. I asked my friend to look at what seem to be 3 white circular objects in a triangular formation hovering above the hills/mountains.  My first thought was it was a UFO, but for fear of being thought crazy, I asked him what he thought the 3 objects were. We continued to watch them hover when he said he thought they were some type of birds, but then all 3 started to move at the same time and speed upwards.  I remember telling him, those were not birds. That, birds did not fly that fast nor that high.  We continued to watch as these three white (not sure what to call these objects) UFO's as it flew further toward us yet higher. I remembered my camera in my purse and told my friend not to take his eyes off the UFO's so I would know where they were as it had grown dark. Yet, you could still see the white circle's that formed a triangle. I was able to take 2 pictures each time my friend having to point them out, so I would know where I had to aim my camera. When I tried to take a third, my camera wouldn't work. I was and am still excited that I have 2 photos.   The photo's clearly show the stars in the sky as well as a bright red circle.  We watched for a few more seconds and then all of a sudden they were gone!",

We watched this white egg shaped object for maybe 5 minutes when all of a sudden as I have the object in view, a dark object fly\u2019s up right next to the white one. They are just sitting there together for about 2 minutes then the dark one speeds off to the south. They were both the same size ,same shape just different color. We turned our attention back to the white one which had moved to another area in the sky. At one point it looked as though it was close to the flight path of planes. I remember thinking to myself \u201cThe guys driving that blimp could have seen this object, or the pilots of the planes\u201d.

I spotted a silver object hovering in the sky. Taking it for a plane, I returned my focus to the road. But within a few seconds, I glanced up again to see where the plane had moved to and it was still in the same spot. I watched it with full concentration, thinking perhaps it was a plane flying toward me, so it would soon get bigger as it approached. But it didn't. It stayed in the same exact spot. As I observed it longer, I noticed it was round in shape, not long and thin like an airplane and bright silver against the sky. I had to return my attention to driving again but when I returned my gaze, thinking the unidentified object was probably gone, it was still there. This charade lasted about five minutes.

It was a metallic disc, with conical shape at the bottom and top, rhombus shaped profile.  It had no windows, lights or moving parts.

It was moving in a straight line with no signs of leaving any trail behind it.

The object was south-west from the moon, it seemed to shift form slowly but it stood still. I went inside to tell my girlfriend to come outside to see if she saw the object as well, she did. The object was right above the Griffith Observatory so it seemed from my perspective, the object still non moving glowing somewhat light-red and orange and gradually shifting form to somewhat triangula shape. Pointed towards the direction of the moon. Slowly it began to move after 5 minutes. The moon was south-east from my perspective. The object slowly moved paralled towards the moon, gradually increasing speed still glowing but throughout it made no sound. It crossed through and left without a trace until it was unseen to the eye.",

My girlfriend and I were leaving a local store in Glendale, AZ  just before 7:30 PM on 10/23/10, and while we were walking to the car we both noticed a single light that resembled a very close meteor. The first light had a tail behind it that disappeared when the light remained still. Within seconds another light was visible directly next to the first.\t \tThe two lights began to move in the same direction at about a 55 degree angle to the N/NW of where we were standing, and both had tails behind them at that point. They were moving up and to my right,  immediately changing to separate directions, and began to move downward, then continued to move in multiple directions. (one would spiral down while the other would zip in the opposite direction and vice versa) \tMultiple times both lights would look as if they had burned out or moved behind clouds and then reappear just as brightly as before. This lasted for about 5 minutes, then it seemed they were too low to see from where we were. The lights were very bright (almost white) and the tails were similar to sparks. The shape was round or possibly oval. There were also two other women in the parking lot that observed the entire occurrence, but I didn\u2019t get their names.",

We thought we might be able to see them at night, I believe we heard there\u2019d been another flare-up even though it\u2019d been about a week or more since the really intense ones. So we were outside about 11p.m., standing on their quiet residential street when the 3 of us, me (57 years old), my friend (about 54), and his mother (about 86) saw a jewel-like thing shining in the northern sky, somewhere above Montrose.  It didn\u2019t move, it was very small, didn\u2019t glow or change colors (kind of clear, actually) but very noticeable. My friend went in to get binoculars to see if we could get a better look at it, and when he did, his mom and I looked away at stars and lost sight of it.  When he came out we could not find it, so they eventually went back in the house, but I decided to stay outside and just look at the beautiful California night sky. I\u2019d occasionally put the binoculars up to my eyes, and since I wear glasses I had to keep adjusting them, not knowing whether to adjust them to my regular eyes without glasses or with my glasses on. I finally just left my glasses off and began looking up, straight up. Suddenly I saw a V-shaped object moving slowly southward. It did have smaller V shaped designs or window or something greenish colored, but not lighted, more of a glowing, I just followed it for a few seconds, maybe 5-10, then tried to look without binoculars.  But I saw nothing, even with my glasses on. When I put the binoculars back up to my eyes, I saw the same type of object except it wasn\u2019t green, it was an ORANGE colored V-shaped object, also moving slowly southward.  I have no idea if it was the original object, or a second one, or what.  Again, no lights, more of a glowing of smaller V-shaped designs within the larger V-shaped object.  The point of the V led the object.  I could near nothing, nor see anything without the binoculars and have no idea how far up, or how big it was. I just guessed that it was some kind of military plane or something, I didn\u2019t know UFO\u2019s were ever reported to be V-shaped, until I saw something on TV last night (Oct 20, 2010) so I decided to report what I saw.",

A beautiful day, I noticed lights through the upper part of my windshield.  There were three, round lights. I watched them as I continued home.  They moved in all directions and at times disappeared and reappeared.  Up/ down, come together and separate. I must of watched them for 20-30 minutes.  When I pulled in my driveway I rushed in to get my binoculars and was unable to find them.  I ran out to see if they were still there and they were. I ran to the neighbors to have them look too; but, no one was home.  I am really sad to this day that I was unable to share/ witness this.

Then my husband said to go get the binoculars so that we could get a closer look at it.  So I went to get them in our car that was parked out front. When I came back, I went through the house and back to the backyard.  My husband came under the awning and got the binoculars from me. When we stepped back out onto the lawn the UFO had vanished.

March 18, 2011 Glendale, AZ 7:35 P.M  I was driving home from work and saw a light falling from the sky.  I turned onto Frier DR and 67th Ave in Glendale, AZ at 7:35 P.M when I noticed a light falling from the sky.  I stopped and got out of the car.  It looked like a single Firework falling from the sky instead of going up in the sky.  It was falling from the sky at a fast pace.  It then split into 2 falling \u201cFireworks\u201d and continued to fall from the sky at a fast pace.  From the speed it was falling from the sky, I figured it was a meteorite.  All of a sudden both falling lights ran into each other and formed 1 falling \u201cFirework\u201d.  It then stopped and formed 5-6 steady lights that just stopped and stayed in one place.  The lights were not in a straight line.  I then started driving towards the objects in the sky.  It felt like I was getting closer to the objects and I thought I was about to see one of the lights up close but some trees got in the way.  By the time I got by the trees it was gone. I have no idea how far away I was from the initial sighting and how high in the sky it was.  From what I saw it lasted about 4 minutes.  There is an Air force base around the area of where the lights where coming from.  From where I was at, at the time of the sighting, I'd say I was about 10 miles from the Air force base.  The steady lights that I saw were big.  It was not an airplane. I was so curious and so quick to pick up the phone that I don\u2019t remember if I saw 5-6 or 7 lights.  Like I said I thought it was a meteorite at first and didn\u2019t think I needed to video tape it.  And I thought that my mind was playing tricks on me after seeing that horrible movie Battle Los Angles.  But I know what I saw and it was defiantly strange looking.  The speed that these lights were falling at and then to just stop and turn into steady glowing lights and sit in the sky was amazing.",

The best discription i can give is that it looked excactly like a meteor, and in fact at first i thought that was what i had seen.  The difference was that this object had no tail associated with meteors i have seen in the past, and it zig-zagged, darting both to the right and left before dissappearing.

      "story": "Fireball on the top of  mountain behind Luke Air Force Base, AZ It was around 10pm and my husband ran through the front door almost paralyzed w/ fear.  He ran down the hallway and I followed asking him to please tell me what was wrong.  He initially said, \"I can't tell you and I'll never tell anyone\".    I kept at him and he suddenly grabbed me by the arm took me out the front door pointed up to the top of the tall hills on the back side of Luke Airforce base and said, \"That's whats wrong.\"   He then ran back into the house.   I stood there focused on what appeared to be a glowing fireball on the very top of the mountain.  I watched it for a while then yelled to my husband that I was going to take the truck and go up there, as it looked like a crashed craft of some sort.  He became hysterical and said, no way.   I then saw jets being scrambled from Luke AFB and a few minutes later I could see headlights from vehicles climbing the mountain trying to get to the fireball.  The road back there is part of the Base, so I assumed they were Base security climbing the mountain.  They only got about half way up the mountain and either stopped or shut off their headlights.   I went back in the house and tried to call local news (perhaps channel 10?).  There was a busy signal, which I thought was odd for a news station.  I managed to calm my husband down enough to tell me exactly what had happened to him while he was on his way home from his meeting and he put his hands on his head and said, that he was on his way home and came to a stop because the man in front of him had stopped suddenly.   You have to understand this is out in a very sparse desert area where it is pitch black w/ no street lights.  He had his window down and then a \"huge\" object floated over his car and the man in front of him.  The man in front of him also had his head out of the window.   My husband said there was no sound at all, but it blacked out the stars above seeming like it took an eternity to pass directly over the two idling vehicles.  My husband said, he yelled at the man in front of him a! fter the object finally passed over and said, \"You saw that right?\"  He said, the man said \"yes, but would never tell anyone that he did\".   My husband said, the huge object floated rising slowly and went to the top of the mountain just on the back side of the base and that's when he had run into the house and into the back bedroom, completely ridden w/ fear. So, I can only report the fireball that I witnessed that I thought looked like a crashed craft as it completely lit the top of the mountain. But the whole story needed to be told, as my husband has NEVER been the same.  It shook him to his very core and would refuse to talk about it as it brought back the intense fear. After a while the fireball on top of the mountain slowly began to fade, but remained glowing for about two hours.  I get angry at myself for not taking the truck up there to see for myself, but it's very rugged terrain to get up there even w/ a dirt road or a fire road on which to travel.   It has taken me this long to tell this eye witness account, but now it is told.  By the way, I went to the front of the Air Force Base (about 3 blocks away)  the next day and it was locked down tight.",

Parked all the way at the top we were having some cigarettes and just talking about life. From the get go we noticed that there were many animals out even though it wasn't a full moon.  At about 6:20 we noticed someone in a motorcycle drive up. He looked very mysterious and went past the point of no entrance. Like 10 minutes later he came back down and my friend and I both thought it was very suspicious. At about 6:30u friend said he was hearing something,  I had no idea what he was talking about. After a couple of cigarettes we decides it was time to leave since it was getting dark. When we got in the car we noticed a huge object in the sky on top of the hill in the direction of where the person in the motorcycle had gone. I couldn't believe what I was lookig at.  It wasn't far at all and it looked like a saucer. There were windows around it and it had really bright lights. After about 3 mi! nute it dissappeared as if it somehow knew that we saw it ( maybe because I turned my car on). I proceeded to driving towards it where the guy in theotorcy me had gone and the skies were clear.  There is no way something that big could have disappeared do fast. Without a doubt it wasn't any craft like the ones I've seen before.",

      "story": "Starlike colorful, red, blue, green, purple UFO that emerged from the other side of the hill Me and a friend were outside my home up in the hills near Glendale community college in Glendale, California, this has been happening all week starting on 10/13/12, when it gets dark and the stars come out, there is this bizzare starlike object, looks so different from all other stars in many ways: 1) its lower (closer to horizon) than all other stars, 2) its brighter and constantly changing colors randomly, red, green, blue, purple, 3) me and my friend were staring at it for a while, ten fifteen minutes straight and both came to the conclusion that it is not stationary, moving so slightly that u had to stare at it a while to notice the movement, goes left, stops, right, stops, towards us, stops, back, stops, all so slowly, always changing color. It basically moves but stays in the same general area, right where the star Sirius is supposed to be.  We pointed it out to a visitor arriving and he noticed movement as well. Just so bizzare, what is this please te! ll me? It has been eight nights in a row now. The most recent sighting was yesterday at 11:58PM we were looking at it to no avail when we finally see it emerge from behind the nearest hills visible from my balcony.  It moves slowly and to the right (we always see it when we are facing E/NE).  If u draw a line down towards the horizon starting from orions belt, its right along that line.  This had been going on all week, but last night, we saw it again, and this time, we saw it emerge from behind the hills, this eliminates any possibility that this starlike bright object is a planet or star.  I would go so far as to say that this object is in the Earth's atmosphere.  When we saw it last night, and recorded video, ended up moving from just above the mountain range far upwards and to the right, unlike any of the six previous (of seven) nights I stayed awake to spot it.  I suspect since it didn't stay in the same general area as it usually did, that it is leaving, and I will no! t see it again tonight.  I will try to keep everyone updated. ! We were suspicious at first, thinking this was the star Capella, or more likely the star Sirius, b/c it is in that same position every night, but seeing it come UP from BEHIND the hillside shows that it is not a star nor a planet/asteroid, anything from space.  It is within the Earth's atmosphere.  I have posted the recordings we have made on my youtube channel billdaburgereater, these are the links to the second and most recent sighting videos.  Though I cannot say for sure what it is, having seen it emerge from behind the hills, I can conclusively say what it is not.  The video does not capture the UFO emerging from behind the hill b/c when it did at 11:58PM, my roommate who has the camera was not home.  The second she got home, she set up the camera on a stand and I have included the following links to this description:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29452Yl4kU4&feature=channel&list=UL (second sighting, not using camera stand 10/17/12)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyb8lce5qn0&list=PLFE3F8777B0C557FD&index=8&feature=plpp_video (most recent sighting 10/19/12)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gabacCVbx1A&feature=bf_next&list=PLFE3F8777B0C557FD (better edited video w/commentary of the witnesses 10/19/12) ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Capella?

The object seemed to be moving, like jittering about but still stationary.  It kept changing colors not flashing but pulsating from red to blue to yellow to green.  Not in that exact order.  So I took out my cell phone and started taking a series of pictures.  Now with the naked eye they just look like pretty lights in the sky, but when enlarged the most amazing details stand out showing what looks to me as a UFO constantly morphing or changing shapes and then cloaking itself and coming back. I would watch the object disappear but kept shooting pictures.  When I enlarged the photos you can actually see a spot in the sky where the object is and it seems to be covering itself with some sort of shield or as said a \u201ccloak\u201d   During this 15mins. I watched and photographed a 2nd object slowly rise from the ground til it was level with the 1st object with perhaps a hundred yards distance between them.  Now object # 2 behaved like object # 1..but with one difference.  Object # 2 mimicked # 1\u2019s movements but shows like a mirror image beside it. Like object # 2 was casting a double image of itself  while # 1 remained a singular image. I would like to submit my photos of this event for investigation.

      "story": "On October 7th 2012, 12:15 in the afternoon. I was on the tennis court, practicing my serve.  When I tossed the ball in the air I saw a flash almost directly above me. My first thought was that it was a plane but quickly realized that it wasn\u2019t. The object appeared as a long rectangle, like a steel beam used to build sky scrapers. It\u2019s hard to know the exact length but I would guess 25 to 35 feet.  It was shiny silver in color. When I first noticed the object it was around 1000 feet and by the time the object had descended to 200/300 feet it had moved much closer in my direction.  Then the object stopped moving and just hung there.  I began back stepping and briefly looked to the ground and by the time I looked up again to the object it had changed form to a machine looking object made of silver balls. I drew a diagram of the flight pattern from when I spotted the object and I drew two different angles of the object.  The drawings are drawn from the best of my memory and resemble the object very well.....but not exactly. I had binoculars in my car and was able to see the object up close. I did take 3 pictures with my close to useless camera on my cell phone.  The pictures don\u2019t show the object very well. I was awe struck viewing through the binoculars and by the time I had thought of taking pictures the object had traveled a good distance from me.  There are other reasons why I couldn\u2019t take pictures earlier but it doesn\u2019t matter. It is what it is. You have to zoom in on the photos and the object will come into view.  This object was awesome yet very creepy and spooky. It shined like the shiniest chrome ever. It was completely quiet. There was a black mist or haze surrounding the object that was not highly visible. I\u2019m guessing that the haze served as camouflage, blocking some of the shine from the object. Traveling speed was 10 to 15 mph. The object would move a few hundred feet to the north and stop for a few minutes. Then move west a few hundred feet then stop. Then north, then south and so on. Until it disappeared in the western sky. Total viewing time of sighting was 15 to 20 minutes.",

      "story": "UFO sighting over Glendale, AZ, on 9/28/2013 (150 Orange objects) I am a retired state police officer from the state of Arizona after nearly 35 years of service.  I live in north Glendale, north of the Loop 101 highway in the area of  67th avenue. At approximately 7:15 pm, I happened to glance out my kitchen window that faces north, and I observed some bright orange lights traveling from the west to east.  It seemed unusual, so I went out into my back yard to investigate further.   At that time I observed multiple bright orange objects coming from what appeared to be the Lake Pleasant area which is approximately 15-20 miles northwest of my home.  They were traveling from the west to the east.   In my mind, I immediately thought these appeared to be Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO\u2019s).  I immediately thought to myself, \u201cIf I don\u2019t get pictures, nobody is going to believe me.\u201d  I re-entered my home and got my I phone and started to take pictures.   The objects were being partially blocked by some trees on the golf course so I decided to go out on the golf course where I could obtain non-obstructed pictures.   I have a great interest in UFO\u2019s and have done a fair amount of reading up on them and was convinced the probability was high that these were in fact UFO\u2019s. I filmed these objects for probably over 5 minutes.  At one point my video stopped and I had to restart it again.  I was in awe because they just keep coming.  I would estimate as many as 150 of these orange objects.   It\u2019s hard to estimate their speed.  They were not going as fast as a military jet and they were not stopped.  They seemed to maintain a constant speed that I would have to estimate at 150-200 mph.  I did not see any particular formation.  There would be 5-7 of them traveling together and others following behind in a line.   It appeared to me that when I first saw them coming from the Lake Pleasant area, that as they came higher they were trying to catch up to those ahead.  They maintained a constant orange glow with no flickering.  I observed no other lights on them, just the orange glow. I know that the Phoenix area had reports of a meteor last night.  This was not a meteor.  A meteor travels so fast that if you blink, you may well miss it.  Meteors are generally a white flash of light or fire looking and these objects were bright orange in color and had a controlled speed far less than a meteor.   This was not a weather balloon as the government might claim.  There were approximately 150 of them and they were rising at a speed inconsistent with a weather balloon.  These were not Chinese candles (candle lit objects that rise from the heat of the candle).  The objects were much too fast to be Chinese candles.   These were not military flares as some might think.  They were rising, not falling, as flares do after being shot into the air or falling after being dropped. Once again these objects were traveling from west to east at approximately 150-200 mph and as they passed just slightly east of my home they seemed to just disappear.   This parade continued for over 5 minutes.  As some would disappear, others would appear from the lake area. When all were gone, I went back into my house to call family to tell them what I had seen. Like most people out there some were believers and others had their doubts.  I thought \u201cbut I have video proof\u201d, and when I went to view the pictures, nothing was visible, just a black screen.   I know what I saw and unless someone has a better explanation, I feel that I was fortunate enough to see what many of us hope to see someday and will not.   I have absolutely no reason to make false claims or file false reports. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be exceptionally objective and sober-minded, in describing his sighting.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally reliable and capable witness.  PD))",

Glendale, MO On 24 November 2012, at 21:00 hours CST approx, while driving south on North Sappington Rd in Glendale, MO, I saw 4 luminous objects of unknown shape flying low, slow and absolutely silent.  Each of the objects had 2 amber colored lights at front and one red light at the rear.   The objects then turned to the East. These objects flew single file with unevenly spaced distances between them.   The last object in line seemed to cut off its lights as it was turning east.   The duration of this sighting was 5 minutes approx.  I inquired with several news media in St. Louis if anyone had made a UFO report for the same time and date, all said no. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I had a chance to review the latest sightings posted on NUFORC.  I reported a sighting of 4 luminous objects for November 24, 2012 in Glendale, MO.  I happened to note that someone in Kirkwood, MO at approximately the same time and location made a very similar sighting.  Glendale is situated between Kirkwood, MO and Webster Groves, MO. I believe the other witness in Kirkwood, MO saw the same objects I did.  This is highly interesting. God bless,((NAME DELETED))",

We turned on 35th ave and saw another one moving past us at a high altitude.   We then pulled into a driveway that went into a open desert area and one came from the tree line heading towards us.  As it got closer it began climbing higher and was straight ahead of us and stopped.   From the same tree line a second ball of red light that had a cone of light shining from the top of the ball began to follow the first.   Once the second ball got closer to the first the first one began to take off again heading away from us and climbing higher into the night.   As the second ball followed the first ones path turning away from us a THIRD one began to fly towards us from the same tree line.  This one seemed closer and even bigger.  It turned away in a large turn and quickly sped behind the other two.   All three got to such an altitude that they disappeared.

We proceeded across the street to the campus for a better look and these orbs started changing colors between red and orange.   These objects were flying too close together to be any kind of commercial or military craft.   They began to ascend and fly toward the east, eventually we lost sight of those five.  Then, we saw another orange orb that seemed to be catching up with the others.   As I took a picture of it from my truck, it was as if the flash from my phone caught its attention and it stopped in mid-flight for about 5 seconds, then began flying again toward the eastern sky.",

      "story": "UFO seen by USAF Air Traffic Controller and the entire 4 man crew at Luke AFB in August 1974.  While on duty as the Tower Chief at Luke Air Force Base in 1974 we in the tower received a call from Command Post over the \"Hot Line\" at which time the Col. on the other end said that a resident of a nearby community called Sun City believes she see a UFO and ask us to speak with her.  I a Staff Sargent and the senior NCO in the tower took the call.  Immediately the lady started directing us to look West just above the White Tank Mountain range at which time she pointed out a rather bright glowing object located approximately 15-20 degrees above the peak of the White Tanks.  At first glance it looked somewhat like a star.  She kept asking us over and over \"do you see it, do you see it?\" to which we answered, \"no\".  I wish to point out at this time that we lied to the lady.  We saw the object all too well.  But, due to the extremely heavy amount of paperwork we would have to undergo not to mention a psychological assessment we answered her, no and that was a lie.  To this day I regret lying to this lady.  The actual incident was as follows.  The UFO was real and clearly visible.  It glowed orange to red and seem to move all about at approx 2-10 degrees each time it moved.  We observed this object for over a 45 minute period and suddenly, and literally in the blink of an eye it shot up and off to the right (North)at about a 15 degree angle off vertical and suddenly it was gone.  The object departed in what I call \"the speed of thought\".  To this day my greatest regret is not validating the ladies comments who called us as she asked them and let her know her eyes were not lying to her but were real.  I at 66 years old that the UFO was as real as I am.  I record this incident at this time to support the truth movement in UFOs and promise to support the movement from this time forward as I have for the past 20+ years.  As a former Staff Sargent in the USAF, and a Tower Crew Chief at the Luke AFB Control Tower, a Former Phoenix Firefighter/Engineer, Business Owner, a Jet Aircraft Mechanic for Lockheed Martin and NASA, a Husband, Father and an American Patriot I promise you these comments are true and honest.",

Both witnesses, male and female, in their early 60s, rational, well educated, and with good vision.  Both saw the event in the exact same manner.  The female is a former single engine pilot and wrote this report. Weather, per weather service, at time of sighting:  Clear, visibility 10 mi.; Temp 68F; Wind, calm; Barometer, 30.03in. I was saying goodbye to my friend out in my patio when he said, \"What's the hell is that?\"  I turned and looked at where he was pointing and at about 1500 ft. altitude over Glendale, about two miles to the south of where we were standing, we saw two teardrop shaped craft.  They looked like red flames with dark yellow center.  They were hovering for approximately two to three minutes then one of them started to move upward and south. The red light started to change intensity as it traveled, then it suddenly picked up speed, still heading south on an upward trajectory and within 30 seconds of acceleration, suddenly disappeared. The second craft had remained in its original position, and continued to hover and was bright red with yellow center. After the other craft disappeared, it started to head north towards us maintaining the same altitude. Movement caused its lights to vary in intensity just as it had the other. It continued north for about a minute, then rapidly reversed direction, increasing speed, then started an upward trajectory as the lights became more dim then suddenly, at an altitude where it would still have been easily visible, it disappeared; like someone turned a light switch off. There were no other aircraft in the vicinity during or within an hour before this event. There have been none since, and it is now 45 min. past the event. I have all manner of aircraft flying over, around, and nearby my location. I am well acquainted with the different sounds and know how far away they can be heard. I am also a former pilot.  At a distance where any known aircraft would have been easily and loudly recognizable, THESE OBJECTS WERE SOUNDLESS.  They were shaped distinctly like a teardrop, with the pointed end facing earth.  They looked like traveling \"red candle flames\", with a yellow center. This sighting is remarkable for, 1) soundless craft, 2) rapid in-line change of direction, 3) rapid acceleration from hovering, 4) complete disappearance in an instant, 5) shape of craft inconsistent with known aircraft, 6) colored light completely surrounding the craft, 7) variation in intensity of lights between hover and movement (light grew brighter when it hovered or slowed). This report was also phoned in. (near end of conversation, call became disrupted then suddenly dropped) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sober-minded and eloquent.  We suspect she is an excellent, and reliable, witness.  PD))",

I saw a report of people seeing globes hovering in 1 spot for about 20 minutes, this is not what we saw.. we saw 1 object.. and from the back n forth movements..  It looked as if it was searching for something..  it was moving quickly and almost erratically.( it almost! looked like a object being held from a string..  like kids do.. but clearly this was not the case.. it was large.. but at some distance and that made it hard to gauge the actual size).  but did slow down during this duration and hovered still at one point before moving again..  then it was going away from us.. and we lost sight of it past the horizon.  I will have the camera ready tonight in case we see it again..  People rarely believe these stories until you see it with your own eyes..  I know what we saw.. and it was no plane!! or any other aircraft I've ever seen.  and while we saw this.. there were planes in the distance!!  There are always planes in the sky here, 24 hours a day..  So they had to of seen it too!!",

But I remember 3 mins in I did notice that 2 disappeared from the bottom of the Y. and so there were 3 on top like a V-shape balls lighting up.  It goes on for awhile.   But after ten minutes we left that area and drove off to another location.  I've heard of people seeing this object in the sky before but this is the first time I've caught it with my own eyes.",

There was this cluster of 20 bright crisp silvery metallic white lights in a loose grouping.  The angle we were looking up into the sky was 30 degrees.   The lights appeared to have a pattern they were blinking off and on through but neither of us could tell you specifically what it was.  This grouping of lights, for lack of a better description, moved in a westerly direction as if attached to a drunken butterfly.  Slowly, left, right, forward, stationary, rinse, repeat.    Although the lights were moving farther west and away from us, they were still very bright white.....not soft or amber but clear bright white.

It was so low that the house shook.   I rushed out side to try to catch a glimpse of this helicopter and to report it to the FAA. I was in for a huge surprise.  It sounded to me as if it flew a short distance away and then came racing back towards me as if it was a bat out of hell!!   This happened more than a few times.  At one time it seemed to stop over the house and hover there trying to intimidate me.  As crazy as this sounds, I could not see it.  There seemed to be some roter wash, but the noise that the copter was making was almost deafening and the house seemed to be shaking so hard that it was going to fall apart.  And yet I still could not see any nav lights or it.   It finally left after a few moments and has not been back since then.   No neighbors came out to investigate the racket and my wife did not hear it across the street. A interesting side note is this:  I happened to look straight up and saw at about 10,000- 15,000 ft a red orb circling directly in what appeared to be over my house.

We we're talking for a bit, then I suppose I felt something in the sky move and when I looked up, I couldn't believe what bin was seeing.  It was an enormous space craft silently hovering over my neighbor's house, across the street from mine.   I told him to look asking him if he saw whatn i saw.  We both agreed that it was very real and amazing.  We stared at it.  It was unlike anything I've ever seen or heard reported.  It was a dark grey color.  And it shape was like a triangle with the pointed side facing south, then another two triangle shaped protrusions on each side of the ship pointing up towards the sky.  It appeared like it had alot of space inside like there was multiple floors inside.  There was a very large amount of window like squares with what looked like shiny redish, greenish, blueish and purpleish pearlescent squares all over the surface.  Also, many white lights next to the squares  that we're randomly lighting up. It looked like a large futuristic panel of buttons and lights. There was this wing like triangle coming out the bottom that had red lights on it. Idk what that was but maybe it was to not hit anything while that close to the ground or to enter a house . that's kinda what it seemed like.  We watched it go south bound very slowly and completely silent. We we're in awe and watched as slowly left our sight. It was so unbelievable that I didn't tell anyone for a month or two  and then when I did tell Ppl they didn't really believe me.  But I think I  found a story that was similar to mine but they couldn't explain it since they were not any where near as close as we were. I know I need to report this to see if anyone could tell me anything on what I saw. I wish I wouldve have gotten a picture.

I first saw the object while the car was driving on Glendale Blvd and continued to watch it off and on as we drove onto Hyperion.   The object was solid black, triangular shaped, and seemed to fade into what looked like a grainy smoke, and then became very solid and metallic looking again.  It was low in the horizon just above the tree tops in the distance.   I told the taxi driver about it, but because he was driving in traffic, he could not stop to take a look at it.   I am not a crackpot.  I am a registered nurse and I know what I saw.   I have lived in the Los Angeles area for many years and I know what the Goodyear Blimp looks like.  It was not the blimp!",

I was asking myself and wondering why the \"lightpost\" was very high up in the sky without the post.   Not a moment too soon, I saw a silver disk just hovering in front of my sight up in the sky.  It was like at a stand still.  I gasped and muttered \"Oh, my God!\" and for all I know, in the blink of an eye, the thing disappeared.  It was a UFO.   I glanced at my cellphone wanting to take a picture, but couln't because I was driving and the UFO was so fast in disappearing.  The time was 13:18.

Then it started to move down, to us it seemed as though it was moving slowly, but it appeared to be quite far away so it could've been quickly.  As it moved downward it faded slowly until it completely disappeared.   There were no clouds in the area for it to disappear into.  We watched it until it got so dim we could no longer see it.   I yelled for my husband and by the time he came outside it was too dim for him to see.  We stayed out there about another 10 minutes.  All of a sudden, my husband was yelling, \"Holy crap there it is!!!\"  I looked up in the same spot and sure enough there it was.  So extremely bright and fading as it slowly moved downward.  It appeared to be very very high in the sky.   I am not sure if this was a UFO or something else, but I came upon this site when searching for other possible similar sightings.

      "story": "11/11/17 UFO Sighting Glendale/Pasadena CA, Along 134/210 Freeway and up Lake Blvd. I was driving around 8 pm or so east on the 134 freeway toward Pasadena, CA, on Saturday 11/11/17.  Around Glendale area before heading into Eagle Rock or so, I noticed on the left hand side up above the horizon above hills an object in the air that struck me as strange.  At first it was going in and out behind things.  The lights were strange, and movement strange.   Nothing like that has ever caught my attention before.  I watched it intently as best I could while driving on the freeway.  It then began following along the freeway the entire way I was going in a basically straight line, perhaps 10 miles?  At times I thought maybe it could be a blimp.  But it moved very unusually, not at all like a blimp moves -- gliding easily at high speed.  It kept pace in a straight firm line gliding along the freeway way too fast for a blimp, and somewhat farther down (lower) than you would expect on the horizon, for several miles.  It seemed almost like it was partially sh! rouded or camaflouged, like it was intentionally trying to be non-descript in its appearance/color, deflecting light. For some reason I had an instinct or sense like the object usually has camaflouge not expecting to be seen, but that wasn't fully working at that moment for some reason. It struck me that if I was a UFO, I would not want to be seen and would want to be camaflouged rather than flashy and conspicuous, so the non-descript quality seemed reasonable to me. I wanted to take a picture or video, but I could not safely do so while driving on the freeway. I kept watching it as a drove the whole way.  I then exited LAKE avenue off the 134/210 freeway into Pasadena, turning left and heading north. The object appeared to change directions almost like it was following me.  It too turned left and started heading north parallel to the direction of my car, just as it had been heading in a straight line along the freeway east before I exited and turned.  I know this sounds od! d and strange, but it almost felt like it could somehow sense ! that it knew I saw it and was intent and curious about that.  It caught my attention because it definitely did not seem normal or quite like anything I had seen before, and I could not explain what it was.  It did not move like any aircraft I know about.  Too smooth and fast, not a typical flight path, speed or positioning vis-a-vis the horizon. It seemed almost casual, like it was observing and didn't think it could be seen, and then somehow noticed I noticed it (though I don't know how that could be the case). I'm thinking possible Jacques Vall\u00e9e resonant, a subjective, different order component to it.  I then pulled over on the road on Lake Blvd. in Pasadena so I could try to photograph it, and took the pictures attached here with my phone.  The first pic is a ZOOM IN on the second pic so you can see it better/closer up.  You can see where it is in the sky in the second because the perspective is stepped/angled back.  In the first zoomed in pic, the object looks like a shaded circle/orb shape titled partly 3/4 back with 3 round glowing lights on the bottom.  It continued to \"follow\" along side on the horizon up Lake Blvd. parallel to my car for a couple of miles.  I then turned off right to a side street going toward a residence and lost sight of it.  It held my attention as something strange I observed for around 15 minutes in total, a pretty long duration.  This is the first time I have ever felt like I might have seen a UFO.  It did feel instinctively like it was something unusual, and was something I could not explain or recognize.  I would like to know if there were other sightings reported at this same time and area. This is reported anonymously, to add discovery and investigation.  You can feel free to freely contact me with questions, information, or follow up, however.",

      "story": "Saucer shaped aircraft with 6-8 white circular lights on its bottom side spotted near the dead of night by a cousin and me. I want to clarify before anything else, the incident could have taken place either 3 months prior or 3 months after the date entered.  All I can guarantee, is that using information such as my work history, housing history, and the travel history of my cousin; what we saw occurred within the first 6 months of 2015. No sooner and definitely not later.  The time and location however are relatively accurate, slightly before midnight and seen from 71st Ave and Bethany Home Rd and facing South. *All the information gathered here was obtained with the help of the other witness mentioned, all matching*   During a routine weekend at my father's house, my cousin spent the night over like he\u2019d done a number of times before.  After arriving and spending some time playing video games I decided a snack was in order.  After realizing we were low on food, and starving, we decided to make a quick run to our local Frys/Kroger store down the street.  It was around 11:15 PM when we decided on this. Prior to leaving, and against my cousins wishes I decided to smoke a bit of marijuana to help with the pain of being an athlete.  As a long time smoker I knew this would not drastically impair my ability to walk and/or think and that it\u2019d help me deal with the soreness in my ankles from constant soccer.  My cousin did not ingest any marijuana, alcohol, or anything of the sort prior to either arriving at my then home or leaving with me to walk to the store. 15 minutes of prepping and smoking, and 20 minutes of walking later we were nearly there. My cousin, slightly nervous about being out so late and being caught by his father, decided to call my uncle to check in and let him know we\u2019d be in bed soon enough (a lie).  It was during this call that I, while gazing around the familiar neighborhood noticed something above me and not at all far away in the night sky. Only after taking 5-7 seconds to repeatedly blink and rub my eyes did I gather the sense to immediately alert my cousin as to what I was experiencing.  Above us were 6-8 near white lights, forming a perfect circle and a moderately bright one at that.  Past the lights, once hyper focused you could make out the dark saucer shape the lights were obviously a part of. There wasn\u2019t any rotation of said lights, no pulsing, and no odd details.  The object sat stationary while being viewed and emitted ZERO fumes, projectiles, and strangely enough, sound whatsoever.  It was so quiet in fact that I recall the embarrassment of being able to hear my cousin explaining to his father/my uncle what we were seeing and practically revealing that we were outside and not in my home as he\u2019d previously described.  I could hear cars driving by us and in the distance, I could have heard crickets if there were any, just not the craft. After about 60 or so seconds of staring, the craft proceeded to accelerate like no aircraft I\u2019d seen in my 20+ years of living.  The object went from being the sole focus of my vision, to zooming straight upwards and decreasing in size within an instant; vanishing almost cartoonishly.
