These lights did not look like any aircraft I've seen, it did not have any blinking lights and it was moving considerably faster then the airplanes I typically see overhead.  These lights were also really bright and from what I was seeing the lights had almost a bluish green tint to them.  The whole thing lasted only a few minutes and they were out of view.

I work as a food delivery driver in Madison, Wisconsin, and on July 13th, at approximately 21:35 hours  I had a delivery to make and I happened to glance up into the night sky to the south.  I\u2019m used to seeing various aircraft, both Civilian, military and commercial come and go through Truax field.  But this didn\u2019t have the typical aircraft light set up with the Red and green navigation lights, nor was there typical landing lights.  Plus growing up near Davis Monthan AFB, I knew my aircraft well. This was 4 red lights in a vertical diamond formation, in an up and down diamond, not a horizontal layout.  Rather close to each other with no real space in between the lights as an aircraft would have between the wings.  The object was hovering in the air, not moving at all. I was at first thinking it was possibly a drone since it was just hovering.  It also made no noise whatsoever, unlike a typical light aircraft or commercial aircraft.  And it certainly wasn\u2019t a F-16 thats stationed here.  Compared to the near full moon, it was maybe a quarter the size of the moon.  I continued watching, pulling my car over to watch it more.  Two bicyclists peddling past also looked up, but continued peddling north. At that point the object was moving north,  and I lost sight of it through some tall trees blocking my view.  I moved further south  and looked back to see the object heading north.  Then stop again.  And then  it split into two objects, both of 4 red lights.  And quickly both sets of lights left the area.  One heading north, the other west.  It took just a few seconds to lose sight of both.  I had viewed the object/objects at most a full 2 minutes.",

As I was looking, I realize it was a very bright and intense green light coming from an big object or whatever it was.  I looked at intervals during 1 or 2 minutes, and then suddenly, I understood that something was not right, because it was big, kind of square and it didn\u2019t move. So I continued looking, went inside, came back, and it was still there, just over me.  I went inside again and thought that I should take a picture, but I didn\u2019t want to leave it alone and loose it maybe.  So I came back again to the backyard and it was still there, not moving.  I could feel some kind of energy. This time I went inside and grabbed my iPhone, and I focused over my head looking directly to the \u201cobject\u201d.  In the instant I took the picture the \u201cbig object\u201d moved in a fraction of second to the right and just disappeared.

At that time,my fiancee (who was driving) and I had just passed Madison on our way home to the Twin Cities from Chicago on I-94.  I noticed a bright object moving from north of us to the south, which I initially took to be the ISS (space station).  The first glimpse put this object at the 1100 position (assuming the hood of our car is the 1200 position, and it was to the west of us about 35 degrees off the horizon.  As I am a former member of the military (16 Tango - ADA) I was extensively trained in visual identification of both man made and naturally occuring atmospheric phenomena.  I quickly deduced that this was in fact not the ISS due to its increasingly fast speed.  This object did not have any visible navigational lighting, nor strobes.  I watched the object traverse the entire expanse of sky from the 1100 position to our front, to about the 630 position behind us all in about 10 seconds before it disappeared into nothing. Within a few minutes I contacted the Columbia County Sheriff to describe the incident, and left my name and number. I am very interested in knowing what this object was, and if anyone else sighted this very fast thing near Madison last night.",

I began to take pictures with my camera phone, when it came directly above me.  I leaned out of the car and listened and heard what i thought might be a slight whirring noise.  As the object moved to directly above me, I noticed that there were 4 lights on the bottom, and very intense. They were in the shape of a square, as if they were on the 4 points of a square.  That was the array of the lighting, although the lights appeared to be circular or cone shaped and were very bright.  I observed for a while, and took a few pictures with my phone although you can only see lights in the pictures because the camera isn't very good and it was dark.

I went out at night and looked up, and I saw four uniformly lit orangish lights in formation accelerating westwards, and then another slightly larger light to the north following it.  The objects were appoximately egg-shaped, although it was hard to tell because of their speed, and their brightness was approximately one-third of the moon.  They were about a third of the size of the moon, and the four were in a paralellogram formation, with the long ends facing east to west.  They resembled fighter planes flying in formation because of the relative movement to each other when they traveled, but the accelerated so quickly that no plane could ever go this fast.  The formation was about two times as long as the moon, and about one moon or less wide.  The objects were silent and appeared to be at a very high altitude, yet they accelerated very quickly and uniformly.  As soon as I looked up they began accelerating and in about 2 seconds they went from directly overhead to close to the horizon and out of sight.  A second later the other object to the north followed with the same acceleration and speed.  This other object seemed to take off from kind of a small curve, and then it followed a straight line.  The sky was completely clear so I know these couldn't have been reflections.  I know what meteors look like and I am certain these were not them.  Also, I have seen some of the fastest planes in the world flying overhead at low altitudes, and they were nowhere near as fast as the objects I saw on this night.

The only light on a plane that is that bright is the taxi light, and the elvation was not coducive to a landing pattern. This object was not mooving as fast as a plane would if it was landing, flying towards or away from us. My reference was the fact that this object's light was equally intense through the whole sighting, the light did dissapear then returned several times while keeping the same position in the night sky. It was just hanging in the skly several hudred feet above and few miles southwest of the dane county airport. My girlfriend and I were watching the light and I'd begun to think that this was just A low flying plne traveling away from us at an angle that made it appear to not move at all. I was in the navy for a while in the late 90's as an A.E. stationed in Lemoore Ca., and have seen alot of aircraft flying at night. This was like nothing I've ever seen. The object would dim out then come back just as bright as before, when looking at it through my girlfriend's digital camera \" the stillframe side and magnified it appeared to change color as aposed to the white light shutting off, it would change to deep red, blue, and green. The object would also shoot multi colored beams of light out of the top of the object. The \"beams\" gave me the impression that ther was more to the object than we could see in the night. The object started to move lower in elevation not losing any brilliance to the light, and it would move side to side, we went outside to see more, watching for about 1 half of an hour.",

      "story": "Two separate observations of the same UFO object/behavior with blind verification.  Close proximity. July 21, 2007 Approx. 21:00 Central Time Northwest of Madison WI Traveling Southeast on RT 12 and while turning East onto RT 19. Partly cloudy skies, dusk light, slight breeze.  My wife, son and I were driving home from a walk in the woods.  It was dusk.   I was driving, my wife was in the front passenger seat and our 3 \u00bd year old son was in the back child seat (not a very reliable witness, I'm afraid.)   While heading southeast on rt 12 shortly after crossing the Wisconsin River we were driving up the hill leading out of the river valley.  My attention was on the street in front of me when I \u201cfelt\u201d something trigger in my peripheral vision vertically above my line of sight.  My gaze moved strait up and I found myself seeing a saucer shaped object with a high dome centered on top.  The object appeared to be relatively close and at a low altitude.  Between the visible horizon  and our location.  If I were to guess a diameter based on the perceived distance of the object I would say it was similar to that of a medium size commercial airplane, but that's really a shot in the dark.  The object radiated it's own light, which appeared similar to the Sun.  A high energy orange-ish yellow, but did not appear to be flickering or com busting, appeared very stable.  As soon as my direct vision registered this object it promptly disappeared.  Just sort of blinked out of existence.  I barely acknowledged it.  Although it did seem extraordinary, it was so quick and I was the only observer so it seemed almost useless to talk about and I promptly stuffed it to the back of my head. In addition to the above reasons for not dwelling on it is that I have been doing some fairly in depth research into the ufo disclosure culture recently and it could easily be interpreted that it was what I *wanted* to see.  It would have been left at that, except about 3 \u2013 4 minutes later I was making a left hand turn onto WI HW 19 east and out of the left edge of my peripheral vision I saw the same color in the sky.  But before  I even had the time to turn my head and look at it my wife GASPED.  \u201cDid you see it too!!?\u201d *Now* I was excited.  Before explaining at all what \u201cit\u201d was or indicating my observation, she described the same object, color, including it blinking out of visual perception as soon as her attention was drawn to it. She actually got a better view of it than I did.  It's possible this was a second object separate from the one I witnessed, but I doubt it.  It seemed like it had been stationary relative to our change in location.  When we got home she drew what she saw and her drawing matched up perfectly with the shape I saw.  The most curious part of all of this is that it's only been for the last few weeks that she and I (to a greater extent, me) have been researching available data on the web pertaining to ufos/technology, attempting to find only the most credible sources and hard data.  It's amazing how much is out there, buried in disinformation, noise and junk claims, but the credible stuff is mind blowing and almost incomprehensibly important.  Regardless of what we saw tonight, it does feel like we are on the verge of something trans-formative as a species.   We better be, or else we'll just been a sedimentary layer of interesting archaeological artifacts soon enough.  I'm interested in speaking with other rational people about these topics.  I will see if the site admin here is willing to connect other with me without publicly disclosing my information.  Otherwise check out Craigslist or myspace for \u201cmadison wi exo-politics\u201d in some form or fashion.  +m",

      "story": "While on Greenhill Road in Madison, Connecticut, coming from Killingworth, Connecticut, at approximately 7:40 P.M. last night, on Friday, January 18, 2008, I saw a round light fall from the sky.  The light was not colored.  It did not blink or make any noise.  If the sun were a basketball, this object was the size of a baseball.  My first thought was the object was a shooting star.  But the sky was dark last night. And, I honestly do not know what a shooting star is.  My second thought was that I saw a meteor or some debris from an airplane Then, as I watched the trajectory of the object, the object moved northward, toward North Madison. I watched this object move for about ten to fifteen seconds. What bothered me was that the object did not fall straight downward.    The arc created was at least 1000 arms in length \u2013 perhaps even some several thousand arms in length.  (I am a terrible judge of distance).  I pulled my car over to the side of the road and waited for a crash:  the object just disappeared out of my sight.  I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.   The object was not an airplane or helicopter.  It was moving way too fast to be either.  Nor was the light source originating from the ground:  there was no light beneath it.  More specifically, if someone had beamed a flashlight or advertising light into the air, there would have been traces of light underneath this beam.  There were none.  I probably would have just shrugged the entire incident off as being a shooting star or meteor \u2013 and it\u2019s entirely possible that\u2019s what I saw.  However, when I turned on the TV at 9:00 PM EST, to the Larry King Live episode regarding the sightings in Texas, I figured at a minimum, I needed to report this.",

      "story": "Two Triangular Craft over Madison Alabama Around 8:00p.m. I was driving home heading east on hwy 72 in Madison, Alabama. As I drove toward Wall Triana Hwy I noticed two bright lights above a field that was located next to a Grocery Store.  Normally I wouldn\u2019t have paid any attention, except there were no flashing lights and they were very low to the ground I\u2019d say close to three hundred feet off the ground.   They were very still and seemed to be motionless. I decided to pull into the parking lot of the grocery store so I could get a better view.  I pulled to the side where the field was and sat facing the field so I could observe this.  The whole time I was speaking on the phone to my boyfriend.  When I finally parked the car I could see that these were not just two big lights rather they were a multitude of lights arranged in a triangular shape. I rolled down my window and the only sound was that from the hwy behind me, no noise as that of a plane could be heard. The first craft began to move south at a slow pace. I\u2019d say at a maximum speed of 10mph. Then a moment later the second craft followed. The first craft had a row of four white lights, then a row of three, the middle light on this row was red. Then a row of two lights and one light to complete a triangle. The red light in the center of the craft was blinking, but all other white lights remained solid and consistent. The second craft was exactly the same as the first one, however it lacked the red light, only white lights in the shape of a triangle. As the crafts moved over head you could make out a faint shape around the triangle, the only way you could even notice was that it would block out stars as it moved even though the triangle part wasn\u2019t over the star yet. Both craft continued at this slow pace until I could not see them from the front anymore and then they became invisible in the night sky. I didn\u2019t have anyone else in the car, nor did I have a camera. Believe me I wish I had both! Where I live is close to Red Stone Arsenal (military base) and Huntsville used to be headquarters for NASA. So I can\u2019t say that it wasn\u2019t a military plane, but it sure wasn\u2019t a plane as we know it today. Either way UFO or secret plane I have never seen anything like it in my life!",

It was completely still, no wavering, wind movement, etc.  When we got to my house we stood in the driveway and watched it for a few minutes.

Friday,  November 16,  2007 at around 1:30 p.m., I\u2019m standing in a field in Madison County, Virginia as my daughter is riding her horse. Staring up at a beautiful isolated puffy white cloud in a northwest direction I spot something unusual. The sky was perfect blue and it was a bit windy. I stare through my polarizing glasses, which allowed me to see the clouds and sky clearly, at 8 to 10 small round shaped white objects moving in formation similar to Canadian geese forming and reforming a triangular shape. My immediate reaction was that it was a flock flying as you always see them. As I watched, I realized they were up by the clouds some 5,000 to 8,000 feet or more, and were colored white, not the usual dark color of geese, and staying very close to the cloud at that high altitude. I watched for some 15 to 20 seconds until all of a sudden they disappeared into the cloud. I kept watching for another 2 minutes or so until the powerful winds quickly swept the cloud away. I kept searching the blue sky for the objects, but saw nothing. Later I was kicking myself for not getting my camera, which was in the car about 300 feet away and taking a shot of the interesting sight, but my mind was too busy at the time trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Fortunately, I am a computer artist and illustrator and was able to recreate the event soon after the sighting in Photoshop. The more I thought about the event the more I realized I\u2019d never seen anything like that before.",

      "story": "Amber orange light moving very slowly, dimming out, shooting away. I was in my second story bedroom, when a bright light caught my eye. Our house is quite close to the local airport and is almost directly under a common flight path taken by incoming airplanes. It is therefore extremely common to observe planes with bright, white flight lights approaching from the south. For a number of reasons, however, this was different:  1. Even indoors with the windows closed, you can always hear approaching passenger planes. They are very loud, because they are very low. This object made no sound audible from inside the house. 2. The path taken by planes on their approach is completely predictable (essentially, they go over our neighbor's house to the east). This went over our neighbor's house to the west. 3. It was moving very slowly. Because it was a light in the sky, I feel it's hard to say how far up it was; it seemed like it wasn't much higher than 2 or 3 times the height of the tall, mature trees in our neighborhood. Could be wrong about the height. Regardless, it appeared to be making the progress of a car going around 5mph (if it was as close as it appeared). 4. The light was bright amberish orange, unlike the lights of the passenger jets that pass overhead ... bright white at first and then red and blue flashing lights as they get closer. Because it looked odd, I went outside to our porch to get a better look. I found it in the sky again outside. I could still hear no sound. Again, it seemed strange because it was moving so slowly. Its path was completely straight and it moved from roughly south to north. I tried to film it with my cheap digital camera, but the camera was unable to pick up the small light. After a minute of observation, it had finally reached a point parallel with our house. Then, the light dimmed out completely. As I turned to go back inside, a speck of light shot very quickly upwards from the point where the light had dimmed. This final observation, of sudden insanely fast movement, is what really spooked me. I've seen plenty of lights in the sky that have seemed odd, but I always felt that my impression could be a misinterpretation of something mundane. This event seemed truly weird.",

I noticed a plane with 3 lights in the shape of a triangle, something about it intrigued me and I could not stop looking at it. As I was driving I noticed the plane was not moving and coming towards me as it should have been. So, I keep my eye on the plane and when I got to Heritage Elementary I saw that the plane was hoovering over the school about 5 to 10 feet above tree line. I could not understand how a plane could do this with out falling out of the sky. I noticed it was a gray military plane with no markings on it. I was so weirded out by this I literally had my head over the steering wheel looking at the plane and was wondering if I was the only person that saw this plane hoovering. After leaving the vet I was not thinking about it and drove right past the school and then I thought to myself I wonder if the plane is still there after seeing a smaller plane flying in front of me. As I looked in my rear view mirror I saw that the plane was now flying and going south down County Line Rd. towards the airport. I keep watching the plane the whole time and felt like it was following me, it stayed 15 feet behind me the whole way. As I turned East on Palmer Rd. I thought the plane would fly over me, but no it proceeded to go down Palmer Rd. with me and the weird part is the plane did not turn left like I did, it stayed facing South but flew side ways down Palmer. At this point I was terrified and thought my mind had to be playing tricks on me. I speed up and after passing the Palmer park I came into the group of trees and the plane seemed to have stopped, almost like it couldn't see me anymore. At this point I slammed on my breaks next to the Madison Water Dept. and watched the plane. It proceeded to start flying \"normal\" and going South towards the airport. I keep my eye on the plane as I drove towards Sullivan \"Wall Triana\" and once I turned going South on Sullivan I could not see the plane. A plane this big would still be visible from Sullivan, but it disappeared and was no longer in sight.",

This was actually the first of two times I have seen this strange light. Both times there were other witnesses besides myself with me. We were eating pizza outside in my front yard.  We live in an area where there isn\u2019t much light pollution, so we were looking at stars.  We were trying to find constellations we knew, when two of us (myself and one of my friends) saw the light.  We told them to look as we watched it. The object first appeared to be star, which we then noticed was slowly moving.  It had been fairly faint, but still noticeable.  We hadn\u2019t been paying attention until it started moving.  It was in the north north-eastern sky and was slowly moving towards the south east.  As it moved it got somewhat faster, but also significantly brighter.  It got bright enough that it rivaled some of the other stars, but I wouldn\u2019t say it :lit up the sky,\" or anything that significantly.  As it continued to travel, it started getting dimmer and dimmer until it couldn\u2019t be seen.  I wouldn\u2019t say it traveled very fast, and it never got far enough to be parallel with us/over us (though its path wouldn\u2019t have allowed it go over us).  It was a clear enough night that had it been a plane we could have seen something as it continued further.  There was no flashing or sound; the light was white like any other star. There were three guys (counting myself) and two girls.  We were in high school. Nobody had been drinking, or doing any drugs of any sort.  Everybody saw it clearly and agreed that we couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.

      "story": "This is a definate government cover-up UFO 2nd Incident:   Around May 14 of 73 the three of us ((name #1 deleted)), ((name #2 deleted)), ((name #3 deleted)) and I were in military Radar school at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville Alabama. ((name deleted)) was living with his family in Madison just north of the base so I would go there often.  Around 8pm ((deleted)) said come outside as he saw something so I grabbed some binoculars and the camera and we climbed on the roof of the house.  We could see over treetop level to the secret part of the base where was hovering just above the trees a saucer shaped object with spaced flashing red lights on the rim.   After about fifteen minutes two large jet aircraft (possibly C134) circled around and one would dive at the UFO continuously for several minutes until the UFO shot a white pencil beam of light like a lazer at the nose of the jet.  The jet flew directly over us and I saw the jet numbers but figured I better forget and the jet left.   Five minutes later a jet fighter came in diving at the UFO.  I noticed that the width of the saucer was about the length of the fighter about 60 feet.  I didn\u2019t take any pictures this whole time for certain reasons but we could see clearly especially with the binoculars. Finally the UFO must of got the hint and settled down below the trees.  The two jets circled for about 45 minutes then left.   During this whole time the Huntsville airport is usually busy but not one plane was heard until around 2am as we could see it from the top of the house.  Since I have space I\u2019ll mention the first incident. Can\u2019t remember if it was the same night or the night before at ((name 1)) house we heard on the radio that the spacelab was launched and would fly over us about 8pm and that part of it was built at Redstone.  We stood outside and saw it going by from west to east like a moving star.  Then from the north another object intersected with the spacelab, followed it shortly then went south. We thought we don\u2019t have anything that can do that.  Later we heard on the radio that the meteor shielding was ripped off the skylab but that it happened during launch.

The object was very close to us I would say around 500 feet. Also on a side not my wife has observed this same type of UFO 3 time before this in a 2 year span. She saw it twice near HWY 30 near Fair Oaks and the other time was in Cottage Grove. We just thought it was a jet or something but after I saw it myself and didn't hear anything or see any blinking lights and as fast as the UFO moved it made me a believer and i still don't know what to think. I surprised no one else saw anything on John Nolen. I thought it would be in the news it was so obvious. The event took about 20-30 seconds and just vanished. I cant describe it well but if i were to take a laser pointer on \"scribble\" on the wall thats how fast it moved.  If anyone else saw this please post! so i know my wife and I are not going crazy!",

I referenced the object with two pine trees at a range of approximatley 100m across a flat open field the object was situated at an elevation equivelant to two horizontal fingerwidths above the two pine trees the object steadily moved to a bearing of 120* paused for approximatley 2 seconds and then rapidly ascended to the east at a high angle of ascent and disapeared out of site. The weather was as follows: Skies-clear with abundent stars visible and the moon was a wanning gibbous providing significant lighting, enough so that I would expect an exhaust/vapor trail t! o be visible , Winds-Calm, Temperature-Approximatlety 60*F, Humidity-Low. The object made no noise, there was no trail of exhaust/vapor visible. I did not notice any aircraft in the area at the time of the sighting.

      "story": "2 fireball like spheres from the West head east over Madison, same as 08/18/12 So, first off I want to say that this is my first time to ever research &quot;UFO's&quot;.  Once as a kid I thought maybe I taken a picture of one, but the picture was in fact a bead of water on my camera lens. I say that because I have also seen the fireballs that were previously talked about on the 18, same characteristics and everything.  Where I live, to be vague, is about an hour and a half from where the other group saw the same UFO's. Heading from the West towards the East, the first fireball came from the corner of my eye and looked as if it were a plane on fire, I freaked out thinking a plane was going down but there was no sound. I questioned what I saw.  Like the other group I thought chinese fire lamp, but this was to high for the brightness, then the second appeared.  Same direction the second ball of light came, the thought of a plane still was going, maybe a plane in half but again no sound. I got online and researched 'red light over wisconsin'. I found this site and to my findings I feel that the two of us saw the same thing.  Whether its extraterrestrial, I don't know, but take this entry as a validation that I too saw the same thing within 90 miles of the last viewing, heading back from the direction they (on 08/18/12) saw it going.

      "story": "Strange object with red and white lights appears from behind my woods. Me and my son in law went outside to sit on our back deck when we noticed a strange red glowing infrared light coming from the back of my woods.  We stared at it for about 15 seconds trying to figure out what it was since we have no homes behind our little bit of woods.  All that\u2019s behind them is a field of power lines that run for miles.  We were thinking maybe its an animal of some sort looking at us when all of the sudden we hear a very strange but loud noise coming from that area. We instantly in fear ran in the house.  The first thing I did was run to get my  flash light to shine in the back of my yard. It took me several seconds to grab it and go back outside.  As I shined it to the area where the light and noise was coming from.  We didn\u2019t see anything so I figured what I saw needed no flashlight so I turned it off in hopes we could see the light when all of the sudden right behind the trees we were facing we saw these intense lights radiating through our tops of the tree line coming into a visible view for us to see.  It was a small craft with very bright red a white lights flashing around it in a circular motion.  This object was laying low right along our tree and power lines as it moved off out of our sight. There was no noise at all coming from it.  It just flew away in a sort of slow quiet motion.  It was flying so low that it could stay below the tree tops in the field we were facing where our view was limited.   As soon as it was out of our sight we ran down the road to look down the field in hopes we could still see it but it was gone. There was no time at all to even catch it on camera..  We were not expecting to see this since we originally thought it was something else in the woods and couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I\u2019m 100% confident that I saw a UFO. The next day we went out to the area where we saw this strange light coming from and there is an imprint in the tall grass.  The grass is smashed down as if something was presse! d on it. This confirmed to me that what we saw in the sky was ! first si tting in my yard.  I\u2019m frightened by this  and never in my life experienced anything like this.  I feel I needed to report this bizarre incident in fear this craft could come back.  Why was it in my back yard?  Creepy!",

I was driving home heading East on University Avenue on the West side of Madison.  I had my sunroof open.  I am a birder so I always have a pair of binoculars on my dash.   As a was coming down the road on a slight hill just before the state office building (Hill Farms) on the right, and the golf course (Blackhawk CC)  that begins on the left I saw a large object very low in the sky just ahead and to my left about where the Pyre Square Building and McDonalds are located.   At first I thought some helicopters were probably moving some large item but as I got closer it was not.  It was totally silent.  I quickly cross over three lanes of traffic to turn right onto Segoe Road to pull over and watch the object.  I grabbed my binoculars to look at it through my open sunroof.  As I was looking at one of the red lights the entire object just plain disappeared, no light , no anything.   I then spent the next 45 minutes driving around the west side of Madison trying to find it again and ! to find a good unobstructed viewing area.  It was so obvious that I saw something that when I got home I turned the news on since I assumed everyone would have seen it.  There was nothing on the news, nothing in the newspapers - I kept checking for a week or so. What the object looked like was a very large L-shaped thing with red lights on each of the corners.  I assume the reason most people did not see it is that just down the road a mile are many, many red lights on top of the building cranes at the construction sight by University Hospital, in addition to the red lights on top of University Hospital for the helicopter pad (Med-Flight).  So there are twenty plus red lights ahead in the sky as you drive down this road.  But all the red lights there on the hospital and on the cranes blink!   I am always looking up in the sky since I often see owls in flight at night..  I also spend many hours star gazing with either my binoculars or my spotting scope.  I always can see satellites crossing in the sky.  Recently I have been seeing movement in the sky that I do not think are satellites.  These star like objects are much brighter and move way more quickly and straighter that the satellites.  They have been moving from north-east to south, south-west.  I regularly spend many hours at night watch the stars.  About 13 years ago I was up in the Apostle Islands when star gazing one night I found three very small bright star like objects that were arranged in a triangular shape and kept moving around in perfect sequence in the triangular shape.  I kept viewing this sighting for over an hour.  They were very, very far away.  I know other people have seen this kind of sighting.",

I was sober and wide awake because I was a 3rd shift worker at the time.  The streets were deserted as usual for this time of morning. I came to a stoplight at a 3 way intersection about 1 mile from my home.  When I came to a stop I quickly noticed something that looked as though it was falling from the sky.  I looked up to my left toward this ball of rolling light as it got closer and I was just in shock.  In seconds it \u201ccrashed\u201d on and rolled across the hood of my car and continued to roll down onto the curb and onto the side walk where the color changed from this bright yellow color to a purple gaseous color.  It was still for maybe 2 seconds and then shot straight up into the night\u2019s sky. The light turned green and I continued to sit at the stoplight looking up, waiting to see more, but I didn\u2019t.  It just disappeared.  I probably sat there for! 4 or 5 minutes before slowly driving home. I couldn\u2019t believe what I saw.  It was all I thought about that night.

      "story": "7 Large bright lights over North Madison in cloudy, overcast  2:00 AM sky 9/23/2012 I live surrounded by acres and acres of land trust in North Madison, CT.  I have a little ranch house set in the woods but the area around the house is clear of trees.  I have a dog who usually has to go out during the night.  Sometimes I let him out on the back lead and let him wander or I take him out front on leash for a quick pee.  He woke me up at 2:22am September 23, 2012 to go out.  I took him out the front. He did his business but seemed like he wanted to do more, so I walked him a bit down the driveway.  When I had originally stepped out I looked up at the sky to see what the weather would be like the next morning.  It was overcast and cloudy, no black sky and absolutely no stars.  As I walked down the driveway I noticed several very bright, big lights in the sky.  They were situated over an area which is a state park called Chatfield Hollow in CT.  I thought it  was weird because if they were stars, first of all they were super big and bright and there was no black sky around them, just a hazy cloudy sky.  So my sleepy mind is trying to figure how these stars are shining through the clouds. Then I noticed a clearing in the trees that 3 of them are in  a perfect vertical line spaced evenly apart.  My first thought it was the 3 Sisters stars but then realized it couldn\u2019t be them because the 3 Sisters are not so perfectly spaced or in such a straight line. I then noticed to the left  a second set of 3 lights perfectly spaced in a straight vertical line running horizontal to the first set.  They stood motionless but were giving off a very bright glow.  Then I noticed a 7th light off to the left, almost like it was the sideways tip of a pyramid (for all 7 in  formation)   These lights were spaced out very far apart like several football field lengths. This 7th tip light was just as bright but had more of a redish glow.  I remember thinking Mars, maybe this was Mars.  This is what really scared me\u2026.about 7 seconds after I turned my face up to this 7th light and I am trying to figure it out, it got a little brighter for a second, like a quick pulse and then went out  But it wasn\u2019t a quick switch off more like a quick pull back.  And my first thought was\u2026.\u201d.Oh my God, they saw me seeing them\u2026.\u201d  I quickly went back into the house. Needless to say I did not sleep  most of the night.  About 10 minutes later I heard an airforce jet fly over coming from the area the lights were and over my house.  So I was wondering if someone else saw these and reported to the airforce.  I dozed off somewhere around 4:20 and 5:15.  My senses were so alert to all noises at this point. Normally it is so quite at night you can hear your own blood in your veins, but what woke me up was a low steady humming sound that lasted for about 10 minutes.  But I also noticed the crickets got louder if that makes sense.  I was thinking why are they so loud and was afraid to look out the window as I was sure I would see a UFO hovering over my house. This wan't a plan or helicopter as the sound was the same and steady and then gone. So I lay in bed literally frozen in fear and after ten minutes the  humming went away and the crickets sounds had diminished greatly.  About another 15 minutes passes and I hear the humming again but it is fa! ther away, it didn\u2019t feel like it was right over my house and the crickets got louder.  I remember thinking o.k. now they are over my neighbor\u2019shome,  who is down the road a bit. It then went away about 10 minutes later and the crickets quieted down.  A third time I heard the humming faintly, crickets got louder and then it went away.  Crickets got quieter.  I definitely could tell the difference in the sounds when the humming stopped.  (I do not have a furnace that could possibly have made this noise)  At about 5:45 I could finally breath and close my eyes to rest. Here is the really weird thing, my daughter who is 21, her bedroom window faces where the lights were and her bed is up against the window.  When she got up I didn\u2019t mention anything to her.  I asked her how she slept.  She said she got up in the middle of the night and closed the curtains on her window.  She said she woke up in the middle  of the night with the weird feeling someone was watching her, \u201clike some creepy guy\u201d. There was definitely something to these lights. I figured if they wanted to harm us they could do it anytime and there is nothing I can do about it, you can\u2019t call the police.  I know I am not crazy, I don\u2019t drink or take drugs, I am a professional and I have no reason to make this up.

      "story": "Two air crafts both with huge red circular lights. I was walking home from work on the evening of February 8, 2012.  About a block away from my apartment I looked towards the sky straight above.  I also looked to the right and noticed that the stars were extra vivid and crisp on this night.  I looked farther ahead of me and saw two abnormal bright-like stars. I assumed that they were planets but I have never seen two so close together.  Then, again, I look to the right of me and up above I notice a very huge circular red light.  Also accompanying the red light were smaller white-amber-ish lights on each side of the bigger red light.  The sequence of the blinking lights were unfamiliar to me and extremely close to the ground; hovering, in movement. I do not exactly remember how long each blink measured but knew immediately they were unfamiliar.  At this point I was in shock.  I was less than a block away from my home and instead of going straight home I followed in the direction of the red light.  It seemed as ! though the entire craft was a red sphere as it drew away. I turned a left on the street before my block and realized that not only did these lights look foreign but also they were headed in the wrong direction.  Had they been lights from an airplane, the craft should have been traveling more East towards the airport.  Instead the craft was traveling SE. It definitely could not have been an airplane because it was too low to the ground and I heard no sound from where I stood. Through my vision the craft could have been traveling at a speed of maybe 40 MPH\u2026?  I did not get a good look at the shape of this particular craft because as I followed it, it traveled further away flying over tall houses and apartment buildings which blinded my sight. The duration of the craft siting was about a minute long.  \tAfter that I walked towards my apartment. It took less than two minutes to get to my front porch. I immediately sat down and just stared into the night sky. Not one minute had passed when I saw another red light coming towards my direction from the NW. It traveled over Lake Mendota toward my apartment building. I cleared my eyes completely amazed. This craft also had a sequence of odd blinking lights not like the sequence of lights you see on planes or helicopters. The lights also had short awkward pauses and then would resume to the blinking pattern. These lights were also very close to the ground. As the craft got closer I could kind of make out a shape. It was quite dark but my best educated guess would be that the craft had a shape of a triangle prism. The craft also looked like it had a disk-like base and the lights were blinking on the front of the base. As the craft traveled over the apartment building next to mine, I noticed that the underside of the base of the cra! ft looked like half of a sphere. I could not make out any color of the craft due to the time of the evening. Interesting to say, the craft traveled SE just like the first had. I was much closer to this craft than the first but I would assume the speed of travel was 50 MPH.",

      "story": "UFO sighting in Huntsville/Madison, AL  Just after finishing dinner on 7-29-2013, I walked out onto the front porch. It was approximately 6:35pm (18:35) CST. I glanced up because I saw movement, and was facing due north. I saw a commercial airliner, like a 737, that was flying eastward, from near the center of my field of view. I watched it fly for a second, following the vapor trail backwards. When I reached the end of the vapor trail, I noticed an egg-shaped object hovering, just to the left of center, and a little higher than the original flight path of the plane. The egg-shaped object had an aura, or shadow, or pulse, to or about it. Within a blink of an eye, 2 orbs (circular) appeared just to the right and higher of the egg-shaped object. The egg-shaped object had a grayish or metallic appearance, while the orbs had a brighter white glow. The egg-shaped object was larger than the commercial airliner. It was larger in diameter, and similar to the difference in size depicted in the picture. The orbs were very similar in scale to the picture, as is the jet. The main object began to move westward, and had erratic movement. In my excitement,  I evaluated everything in a brief second.  I did not have a quality video camera, and feared that a cell phone picture would provide poor quality, and little details.  I made a decision to go for binoculars, in hopes of being able to see the object better. I ran for the binoculars, returning and seeing all three objects.  The plane was gone by now. At that instant, the orbs disappeared.  I threw the binoculars up to my eyes, and was not able to immediately locate the object.  I pulled them down to re-gain a fix on its location again, found it with my naked eyes, and watched it enter into the clouds. If it appears on any radar, it would be very close to the Alabama Tennessee state line, at about 6:35pm, on Monday, July 29th, 2013. I have attempted to re-create what I saw.  The picture should explain the movement, location, and surrounding veiw point.  The picture is pretty close to what I saw. I tried to provide as much detail as possible.",

As we were just entering the field from north fifth street, my husband started shouting \"look up!  Look straight above!\".  It took me and my husbands daughter a second or two to spot what he was seeing.   All three of us saw three diamond shaped apparitions with red lights on the outside edges of all three diamonds.  All three were hovering/moving in unison, with the front object being slightly in front of the other two.  The objects appeared to be almost transparently gray in color, and appeared to be quite high in the sky.  As we all three watched, they continued moving forward quite quickly, and seemed to disappear into the atmosphere.  The event lasted all of about ten seconds.  We all agreed that it was a very strange occurrence, and that none of us had ever seen anything like it before.  The apparitions are a b! it hard to describe, but I have described them as best as I could.  Thank you for the opportunity to report.",

They were fairly low (helicopter height), but made no noise and did not move except for the one traveling slowly.

She was with her friend and friends family a few miles north from our location.  Our address is Amsterdam Pl, Madison, AL.  Number of witnesses at the other location were around 4.  They witnessed approx. 30 lights in the sky.  The location of the UFOs were North to North West of our location.  The angle of the objects were moving right to left from the horizon (north to north west in straight movement upward).  No erratic movement was witnessed.  The lights were red to orange and in a circular pattern.   The lights finally moved, what appeared to be out of the atmosphere.  At the same time of the sighting a plane was coming in to land at Huntsville Intl airport, from the North.  The airport is situated to the south of our location.  I do have cell phone recording of the event.   At first my phone would not allow a recording, which is very strange, as my phone usually always allows the recording selection.   Finally, my phone allowed some coverage to be recorded. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded quite credible to us.  He is former military, and has considerable experience with flying military aircraft.  We suspect that he is an exceptionally capable witness.  PD))",

A bright orange orb crossed the sky at what appeared to be a relatively constant speed and elevation. I estimate the elevation was 500 to 1000 feet.  The flight path was straight. It was completely silent. It was the size of a pea held at arms length.  The light was very orange, and kind of dancing; like plasma.  At times, a small more defined and brighter center point of light was visible within the larger object.  In the last minute of observation, the light vanish and reappeared a couple of times, keeping the same flight path.  Also during this last minute, the overall shape was morphing more; at one point looking like a cone.  Before disappearing behind trees, the light went out completely; but at that instant a larger black object was briefly visible.  I'm pretty sure this was not retinal fatigue, but an actual black object.  We all saw this.

I noticed a bright bluish white light hovering in the sky.  It was a solid light with a slight flicker.  It resembled a planet, similar to Venus.  As I travel this area daily, the light seemed out of place.  I watched closely and it appeared to slowly move toward my position.  I slowed to about 55 mph on the interstate and looked at the object through the top of my windshield.  Afraid that I was going to cause an accident in the early morning traffic, I decided to take the first available exit so that I could pull over and observe the object.  I exited onto Northbound Illinois Rte 203 with plans to stop at the Gateway Truck Plaza to watch the object.  While exiting, watching the light, and trying not to run off of the ramp, the light just disappeared.  I opened the moon roof and no longer saw the object.  I continued to the Gateway Truck Plaza and parked and exited my vehicle to scan the s! ky.  The sky was lightly cloudy, but above me, and where the object was, was completely clear.  The morning light was very faint and there were stars that were still visible.  After scanning the sky it was evident that nothing could be hiding behind clouds, as there were none in the area where the object was.  I would estimate at the time of disappearance, the object was at about 5000 ft.  I am a Mechanical Engineer and consider myself of sound mind.  What I witnessed this morning has left me perplexed.  Did anyone else see this? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

I went outside for  break from wrapping presents when I noticed a red light, circular in shape, in the snow, next to my car.  It blinked 3 times and then disappeared.  It was 3 to 4 feet wide.   The reason I'm reporting  this is because after seeing this it reminded me of an experience I had a couple years ago, around 1am.  I was biking down Blount street toward the High Noon Saloon.  When I was on the sidewalk next to the MG&E coal castle I was engulfed in a green light or laser that was coming from quite a distance as I could tell the laser was breaking up around me.  I stopped my bike, and the green light stopped.  besides the Christmas similarities I find it rather disturbing.  I don't think it's alien in nature.   Another Madison experience I had about 6 to 8 years ago, we were sitting in my living room with the windows open when we heard a deafening wooshing sound.  It was spring or fall and lasted for 20 seconds.  Quite a while and was reported in the paper. I nev! er heard a conclusion I think the lights are Taran of nature... now the big question... why me?  And what was the wooshing sound?",

Three of us, all Care Techs at Mendota Mental Health Institute, were out sailing on Lake Mendota, after our 3-11 shift.  The skipper and I were chatting.  He was at the tiller and I had the job of intermittently shining a flashlight onto the sail to let other vessels know we were out there.  At 01:00, we noticed we hadn't heard from our third member in a while.  We kidded him, asking if he was asleep, because he was laid back, face to the sky. He answered with a laugh and said he'd been watching three interesting lights. He pointed them out to us.  They were very high in the sky; if one horizon was three o'clock and the other horizon was nine o'clock, then these lights were now at about 11:30, nearly overhead. He said he'd been watching them for a long time and they hadn't changed formation.  They were arranged in a triangular formation, one light leading the other two, and they were just progressing across the sky.  It was hard to distinguish them from the stars on this clear night, they seemed to be just about that size and brightness.  We thought, at first, it was a plane; but then noted you could see the background stars between them as they went. The lights finally made it to directly overhead and they stopped.  They just sat in place for about half a minute.  Then, from a complete stop, they shot apart in three directions and out of sight in a brief second.  We had no idea what they were.  No one talked about seeing them the next day.  No coverage in the news media.",

My son and I saw a very large triangular formation very low in the western sky.  Three bright whitish  lights seemed to change formation from a triangle to an L-shape and seemed to appear as one light at times.    Difficult to estimate size, maybe as large as a football field; and maybe a mile away at first, then it would seem closer, then move farther away again.  It was very erratic in shape, and distance.   It was probably more than one object.   We got in the car and followed it as it moved slowly northward toward Lake Erie.  It made no sound, and we kept losing sight of it due to the tree line.  We finally lost sight of it close to Painesville over Lake Erie near the Perry Nuclear Plant.   The sky is clear tonight and the quarter moon was quite high above the formation.   This thing was too large and low in the sky to be a plane or helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

I ran into Walgreen's in Madison, MS, leaving my father in the car, when I returned I apologized for taking so long (10 min.), his reply was that\u2019s ok, I have been watching the weirdest things in the sky, he said look over there and where he pointed there were two disc shaped objects with lights changing from red to green.  They looked like they were hovering over Home Depot, it put chills all over me!   We sat there a few more minutes (7:15 PM) and decided to leave and go out of the city where there would be no light pollution to watch them.  We drove about a mile and lost them, after getting to an area that was dark and a clear shot of the sky we parked and looked for another 5 or so minutes without seeing anything, I then left heading west after a couple of miles I turned back east and drove to a top of a hill where we saw them again (7:35 PM), they were much further away to the west and not as close together but were stationary and changing from red, green to white.  There were several planes in the sky so you could defiantly tell they were not planes. After another 5 or so minute\u2019s they shot off to the West.  I decided to report this sighting after my father called me to tell me someone from the Madison Airport reported seeing several UFO\u2019s last night.   This is not my first time seeing this type of thing, I grew up about 15 miles west of Madison, MS, and in the time I lived in Flora, MS (21 yrs.) I saw more than I can count Unidentified Flying Objects mostly in the Big Black River bottom west of town.  There have been several national stories done on all of the UFO sightings in that area.  This is the first time in 28-30 years I have seen any, but knowing from many years ago you could see a lot of them for a few months and then not see any for months or longer.  I believe if you will watch you will continue to see them for a while.   I will be watching for more sightings in the weeks to come with a good camera in hand.",

I have never seen a UFO before but I sighted this one because I was looking for early firework displays.  Also, the night was particularly dark and visibility was crystal clear.  I could see several bright stars and at least two planets. While outside, I was enjoying constellations that I don\u2019t normally see because the night sky was so dark that night.  I saw what I thought was a planet until I noticed that it was moving. It was an orange orb which was slowly moving across the sky.  I don\u2019t believe it was a paper lantern that someone let go to celebrate the holiday because it was a perfect circle with a steady orange glow.  It stayed at the same altitude and speed as it flew over my head.  There was no sound. Since I was hoping to record a fireworks display, I had my camera ready to use.  I was able to film the orb from when I first notice it moving until it began quickly accelerating straight up until it went out of site.  There were no flashing lights, so it was not an airplane. Unfortunately, the recording showed no details and would not make good evidence.  I need to get a better camera for next time.  There will be a next time. Thanks for reading this account.",

Which would make the light technically above Cottage Grove, WI, and not Madison, WI, where I was located.  Estimated at about 500-700ft in the sky.  It was likely located above farm fields.  I watched the light hover for ~3 minutes before it began to fade into a smaller light.  It faded within 5 seconds to 20% of its original brightness and began moving south east and appeared to be moving further away.

I thought it might be a helicopter at first, but as I got closer I thought it was much to big to be a helicopter, and when I got right next to it I could swear the shape was of a passenger jet and I could see the two jet engines under the wings.  It had some red and white lights that were steady, and some red and white lights that were blinking.   Nothing really seemed out of place except for the fact that it wasn't moving.

I woke around 3 am, freaked because I had missed curfew and hurried to leave.  My friend lived at the end of a cul-de-sacred and for whatever reason, at the stop sign, I stopped and I turned completely around and looked up and there IT was... a giant bright light gold ball that looked to be far out in the sky, there was no light pollution and on clear nights like this one you could even see the milky way... anyway it shot off all these colors, then split into two identical balls, each shining with more colors, then it went back to one and then just warped into space it seemed, just disappearing...  it maybe took a few seconds to happen, it happened so fast.  I was so scared and awed at the same time. I knew this was not anything I could have ever imagined nor anything many people had ever seen. I would give anything to see it again and t! o this day always gaze into the night sky for another chance-glance glimpse whatever you would call it lol.  Anyway I had a walk ahead of me and I nearly knocked on someone's door at 3 am but decided not to despite my fear and racing heart, I usually took a little short cut through a little patch of woods but this time decided to stay in the view of the houses. As soon as I made it home, which seemed the trip home took a lifetime, I ran through the house right into my parents room and shook mom awake and told her what I'd seen, then again all morning, I was too scared to sleep alone so I begged for mom to sleep in my room but sadly she declined so I was petrified until the house was awake again, then everyone at school the next day... and still nearly 17 years since it's happened I haven't forgotten and I never will.If it was as far out in the sky as I perceived then this thing/s had to have been enormous....  but I wonder, why did it let me see it?  what would make a scaredy! cat who was always a little apprehensive about being out unde! r the bi g night sky when alone pause and take the time to turn completely  around and look up? fear is a pretty tangible thing when you're alone in the dark... also no noise, no hum or buzz that I recall just a very  brief and petrifying astonished wonder-struck couple of moments.... that will be with me until the day my life draws to an end.

No sound.  It was blacked out with no running lights.  The shape of the object against a background of stars was the only thing that gave it away.

I'm 50, x-military and have never seen anything like this before. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, It was 2x the size of a full moon, however boomerang shaped and completely dark, but duller than the night sky.  I picked it up almost directly above me at 70 degrees and followed it to about 140, until I lost it.   It blocked star light as passed.  It was moving very very fast and the size / speed / altitude did not equate properly in my mind based on anything I've previously experienced.  Then something smaller with a dull white light closed on it from a few degrees North East.  It all took 4-5 seconds max.  There was no sound. The only think I equate it to would be a B2 at 2,000 feet traveling at Mach 10 with no sound.  Impossible. I don't know that I'll call the media, but I will be checking local media for any other reports over the next few days. Regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

      "story": "Pictures I took show an odd looking object in the sky surrounded by bright light. I was outside of a store called \u201cJoAnn Fabrics\u201d facing west when I noticed a nice sunset. I then proceeded to take two pictures from my phone camara, one right after another, holding one higher in the air than the other. Upon viewing the pictures, I immediately noticed that a light with some sort of saucer type shape, above right to the sun, was apparent that was not there when I took the pictures. I am assuming that this may be the moon, however, there were no clouds in the sky to cover the lower half of a would be moon, and the object seems to have risen much higher in the sky in the 2nd picture, which doesn\u2019t make sense for the object being the moon as the pictures were taken seconds apart. Please let me know if this is a valid UFO or if it is some sort of weather anomaly. If it could be identified as a UFO, I can only assume the reason for it not being visible by eye would be because of some sort of cloaking?  Thank you.",

Moving very quickly then turned off at a 45 degree angle and picked up speed then disappeared.  It was a clear morning with the sun shining.   There was no visible object (airplaine, or metal) it was just a bright light in the southern sky and as bright as it was it looked as if the light should have been bouncing off of whatever it was , from the north...it was super weird. No sound, just a bright light ..",
