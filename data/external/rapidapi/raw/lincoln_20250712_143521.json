It did that three times as it approached, and then when it got directly over my house, the light split in two with the appearance of flares, and then was gone.  I realize that this could have possibly been a meteor, but it appeared to be moving to low and slow for a meteor, and the flares coming off traveled in the opposite direction and then dropped down before flaming out.

I\u2019m pretty sure it was the highest point on the way up the mountain.  Out of nowhere we see this light in the distance that just looks like a normal light in the distance.  I give an assumption that it\u2019s either a planet or just a really bright star.  However, as we look an just talk about what possible planet it might be we see an aircraft with a pretty obvious chemtrail goin in the direction of the light.  As that aircraft grew closer to the light it started to do something strange. The closer the aircraft got to the light it started to do a weird shift in brightness.  As if though the light saw what was approaching.  The light started to shift in some sort of pattern like a kind of blinking.  That\u2019s when me and my friend thought something was strange.  We were joking around because we thought it was normal but then it started to pulsate an slowly vanished. The longer I looked to the sky the less I could believe what just happened.  As quickly as we realized the light was there it vanished.  The only thing I could think of that may have obstructed our view was a very small cloud.  However even then I waited to see if this light may return. It did not.  My eyes couldn\u2019t believe what happened.  The light was there one second and as if it was spinning it faded slowly away. It honestly frightened me to the point where I need to reassure myself multiple times that I was not the only person who saw it.  I\u2019m an avid hiker an I\u2019ve seen the skies many times to know the difference between a normality and a anomaly. But I hope you can maybe figure out what this may have been because that\u2019s the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in the sky.  I believe this may have been an extraterrestrial.",

I just found this site and decided to relay information on what I saw this evening.   Over the years, I have forgotten the exact date, but it's as close as I remember it.   My dad was diagnosed with cancer just a couple of days before this and was a patient at what was then St. Elizabeth's Hospital (I believe on South 70th St.).   My husband and I lived in South Lincoln South of Old Cheney Road between 27th & 40th St.  As we were driving home from the hospital we saw what looked like a monstrous round spaceship.  I actually feel silly putting this into writing, as most everyone I know would write me off a kook.   We spotted it about 5,000 - 8,000 feet up in the air over South Lincoln near 48th St.  It was in the air long enough for us to come home and watch it literally \"hover\" in the air without a single sound (other than a dull hum) from the time we spotted it at approx 48th & O St. to our home.   My husband and I were literally frozen.  We don't remember hearing each other talk, although I know I was speaking.   The next day we asked people at work and found just one person who witnessed the same object hovering in the air that night before.  The best way to describe this object was that it was very similar in size & shape as the \"Mother Ship\" in \"Close Encounters.\"   I would swear under oath about this experience.",

They didn't keep a strict v formation though. It was very much like birds migrating. They tend to stick in a v but every now and then one would move over to the side or so. We knew they weren't birds since the formations were so extremely high up and glowing orange. My mother couldn't see them most likely since she shrugged it off as child play.

      "story": "Lights over Lincoln, NE 5-21-06 I had to consult my journal to be sure of the time and date of the occurrence.  A little background information: me and a former friend of mine went to Lincoln to do some work for a few weeks and we stopped by the apartment of a girl I was fooling around with. (She lived a few blocks east of the capital building, a huge art deco skyscraper.)  Come midnight, the lights went down on the Capital and we sat out on her porch gazing up at the sky. I noticed a couple of points of light moving slowly across the sky towards each other (as airplanes would if they aimed for each other) except that the lights approached each other and danced around each other and sped away, like a satellite using gravity as a slingshot. They did this dance for a while, this happened for about ten or fifteen mintues, the lights would fade in intensity and suddenly brighten (although this change in luminosity seemed to be a separate phenomenon from the speed of the \"craft.\") For about 15 minutes we observed 2, sometimes three lights (although one light would always be fainter in this case) doing an impossible tango in the sky.  My buddy thought it was fighter jets, and my former girl mentioned that the lights were well above the feathery cirrus clouds, and I'm pretty sure commercial aircraft don't fly that high. One guess of mine is that the lights were caused by craft skimming on the edge of the atmosphere (hte bright bursts of light caused much in the same way as the splashes caused by a water skier bouncing on the surface of the ocean.) Also the lights would travel below the skyline of Lincoln to almost directly overhead within seconds. We could not hear any engines of jets.  We debated this for probably 15 minutes before the lights faded off. As we were about to go inside I spotted a light again. (It was moving parallel to the power lines above where we sat.)  Suddenly the light brightened, and forked apart into seven or eight lights which for about two seconds moved in tandem with each other (horizontally?) before they began to swarm around and forward (like the flying machines moving en masse in the Matrix 3 or the meteors at the end of Contact moving in one direction) and shot up into the sky. (I called Lincoln 911 afterwards, feeling rather foolish when the woman who answered laughed at me.)  Even now I can believe what I saw; yet I can't. I am a skeptic through and through (I do not believe in the spiritual, I trust in science) and for me to see something with my own two eyes that not only defies the current laws of physics (or maybe it doesn't, not my field of expertise); for me to actually get a fundamental answer to the question of are we alone was something I never expected. I figured I'd die without answers to anything (or at least the big questions.)  Earlier today, a few of my friends and I got to talking UFOs and someone said I should document what I saw so . . .  Well, not much of a story, but when I looked on here to see if anyone reported anything about it and I saw nothing from 2005, I decided better late than never.",

      "story": "Bright, bluish-white glowing oval shoots rapidly and silently across the night sky The strange coincidences surrounding this sighting necessitate a rather long report.  I have never before seen a ufo, and have always been skeptical of them, having felt that there must be mainly psychological forces involved in such experiences, rather than technological ones.  I recently moved back to Lincoln, and have been staying with my parents while looking for a place of my own.  Some weeks ago I had a dream in which an otherworldly craft flew over the house while I was alone on the front porch.  In the dream I called my mother out to witness the thing with me so that at least someone would believe what I had seen.  Then, several nights before the sighting described below, I stumbled upon a video of a 2001 press conference given at the National Press Club in Washington, DC by Dr. Greer and The Disclosure Project, and was stunned by the information presented there by him and his 21 government, military, intelligence community, and corporate witnesses.  This testimony shattered my preconceived notions about ufos--indeed my entire worldview--and forced me to admit that I likely have been a victim of disinformation my entire life.  I was still reeling from what I had learned from this video, and was weighing telling my parents about it as we sat on their front porch on the night of July 21, when my father said \"there's a ufo.\"  He is a level-headed retired journalist who coincidentally spent years as a member of the National Press Club working as an award-winning White House Press Photographer under the Nixon administration.  I saw that he was joking about an airplane flying nearby, but his comment gave me the opportunity to broach the subject of The Disclosure Project press conference and tell the two of them that I thought it likely that we world citizens had been lied to for generations about the reality of extraterrestrial visitation.  It was a difficult thing for me to do, as I am a rational person and was risking my credibility, but I feel that this is supremely important information that everyone needs to hear.  The three of us had an interesting conversation in which my parents expressed their own doubt about the official ufo story, and generally we all just soaked up this astounding revelation without waxing overly dramatic about it.  Some time later my mother went up to bed and my father and I stayed up talking.  Just after 11 pm, as if it had been summoned as verification of my earlier assertions, a glowing, bluish-white object about the apparent size of a pea held at arm's length, brighter than anything else in the sky, appeared about 20 degrees above the horizon (below the clouds) almost due south of us, glowing brightly and streaking rapidly westward at a 30 degree downward angle.  I said \"do you see that?\" and my father replied \"I'm looking at it\" in a stupefied tone.  The object (I call it an object rather than a light because it was a sharply-defined ovoid shape with no flames, rays, or tail) shot in a straight line toward the horizon and disappeared behind the buildings a few hundred feet south of us, absolutely soundlessly.  It seemed to be about a half-mile or so distant, though it was difficult to tell with certainty.  There was no explosion or flash of light at the time the object should have hit the ground, had it been a meteor, comet, or other sort of space debris.  I asked my dad if we shouldn't call the local papers and tv stations the next day to see if anyone had reported anything.  The veteran journalist replied \"why would we do that?  They wouldn't tell us anything we don't already know.\"  A man of few words, he paused for a second or two and then said \"that was what you would call 'a classic ufo'.\"  He later admitted he'd never seen anything like it before.  The next day he joked, \"the ufo people were listening to our conversation,\" with his typical dry humor, but who knows--is that so unlikely?  Just two or three minutes after the sighting I took out my PDA and recorded detailed notes, which formed the basis of this report.  By the way, the animation on your site provided by a witness to a March 19 sighting in Seattle is very similar to what my father and I saw.

Leaving the Gere Public Library at 8:35 pm, I saw what seemed at first to be a brilliant orange star in the lower eastern sky.  At that time, only the moon and a few of the brightest stars were visible (the moon was in the western sky opposite from this anomalous light). What caught my eye at first was the unusual orange tint, and as I trained my eyes on it, I saw it was moving slowly westward in my general direction. I wondered whether it could be a plane on a landing approach, but there was no noise and instead of having blinking navigational lights, the light intensity fluctuated (growing gradually brighter and then gradually dimmer every second or two). I continued to watch this pulsating orange light for about a minute, then it suddenly dimmed and disappeared completely. That struck me as very odd, since the sky was without a cloud that evening. I searched that area of the sky for another couple of minutes but the object didn't re-appear. Several other people were nearby, but apparently I was the only one there who noticed this anomolous light. As the light periodically brightened, it would become several times brighter than any star or planet in the sky at that time, including Sirius and Venus, which were also visible during this sighting.

      "story": "Unknown lights and unexplained observation on Lewis and Clark Pass, MT 11 July 2007 At approximately 23:30 July 11, two of us continental divide hikers were preparing dinner at Lewis and Clark Pass which is about 20 miles East of Lincoln, MT.  At some point we realized we were under observation by two set of light reflective eyes which refused to move despite our attempts to scare them away.   Initially we believed them to be moose or bear, but we were unable to discern the shape of their bodies, and they were soon joined by two more observers.   This had been quite an unsettling experience, however, we are each educated and not one a believer in, I guess others.   However, shortly the aura borealis spanned the northern sky in a manner I have not seen since childhood (can someone confirm this? and is there any association?) and there was an amber light at an in determinant distance which was impossibly of terrestrial origin.   Almost immediately, it was joined by a second and the lights commenced in a searching pattern.   We were quite alone and very concerned for our safety.  We immediately stopped all our light and attempted to calm one of our party members, since it seemed that it would be impossible to escape the searching lights.   We checked each of the party the next day to insure there were no marks that hadn't been previously.  I can't say any of us believe in UFOs, but really we just want to know if any one else experienced or saw anything strange on July 11th around Rogers Pass, MT.",

I was just arriving home from the store about 10:15PM on 9-8-2009 when I noticed my two neighbors sitting outside on the stoop of our apartment complex staring up at the sky.  As I walked up to them I asked, \"What are you looking at, a UFO?\"   To my surprise, the gentleman said, \"I don't know, maybe!\"    I then proceeded to look up in the western sky and noticed what looked to be a bright star.  The \"star\" then started \"blinking/flashing\" different colors like red, blue and silver/white.  The thing that was weird was it was flashing these colors all at once like red on top, blue on bottom but flashing very fast sometimes in a steady pattern.  It would flash and strobe red, blue, red, blue, then blue on top, then red on bottom and all of a sudden it would be a solid silver/white light for like 3 seconds, then go back to the red, blue flashing!  At first I thought it maybe could be a satellite but I thought they could reflect the sunlight in such a pattern.  I have NEVER seen anything like this in my life!   I ran inside and grabbed my digital camera to snap a few pictures and by the time I got back outside, two more of my neighbors were also out looking at the \"star\".  What I thought was weird was that every picture I took the \"star\" showed up in the LCD screen on the camera but not in the actual photos! (Just my luck!) We continued to watch the weird object for another 25 minutes or so and I noticed that it had been moving away ever so slightly WNW in the sky until it finally was out of our view from the apartment complex stoop.  I started to tell my friends about it over the next few days and I think they thought I was crazy or something.  A few days later, on of those friends came over to visit and told me that they had seen the exact same \"star\" that I had described to them earlier that week!!!",

I grabbed my binoculars and went outside and zoomed in on the object in the sky.   I observed the object as it went east, then turned and went north, at which time and then it turned and went west.   And after a moment it turned direction again and went south.  I continued watching it, I zoomed in on the object as best I could and what I saw was either a horse shoe or a lazy triangle, and it had white round circles kind of like cloudy circles on the bottom. Because it was so shinny that is all I could make out, and it looked like it was going higher and higher as it moved, and then continued south until it disappeared.  My self and my wife and daughter in law all observed the object and the same movements.  Called the local newspaper and reported it, and went to your website and reported it.  Duration was 25 minutes. It made no sounds , no vapor trails, as a commercial airline would.  We also observed in the duration of the time we saw the metallic object in the air , we also seen 5 commercial air planes and they were way below this object we observed . This happened in Lincoln, Ca. 95648 ( Tuesday, 26,09 )",

      "story": "Flashing light circles over Lincoln CA for at least an hour My wife and I where sitting on our balcony a few minutes before 8:00 pm PST when a small flashing object object caught my peripheral vision.  Normally this would be of no concern or significance as we live in an area less than 2 miles from our municipal airport and between Beal AFB and Sac IAP, but the strobe of the light was a bit odd, a white light strobing at a pace of slightly slower than 1 sec per flash.   I casually followed the path of the object as it traveled south east then made a long turn that eventually became a large counter-clockwise circle several miles in diameter.  Once again this would not be unusual as planes often circle around waiting for an open runway to land on, but the arc took a long time to complete and the object was at an abnormally high altitude for a plane waiting to land.   I brought this to the attention of my wife then called my two daughters and my mother in law to observe and see if they found it odd.  As we watched the object continued to circle around at the same altitude and speed with each lap taking approximately 10 minutes.   On one lap the object passed directly overhead and we could see that it was two distinct lights of the same size one in front of the other with a small red light that did not strobe joining the two lights.   When the lights would fade out between strobes there did not appear to be any discernible shape to the object and there was no noise.   Also, faint lights or reflective objects appeared to fall away from the object from time to time and proceeded in every direction, but were observable for only a very short time, a second or two at the most.   This continued until 9:00 pm PST the object then took a path directly north east till we could no longer see it.",

I want another try. It's something you don't forget.  What actually got me thinking about it again, surfing channels,there was a show on Discovery channel and they talked about possible energy forms, mercury being one. My story;  It was a clear day, a few high cumulus clouds and at least 6 airliners at different altitudes, 20-30 thousand feet.  We get a lot of air traffic. I was driving north on interstate 95,exit227 I travel this road occasionally.  I happened to be looking at a cloud when I saw this cigar shaped object moving through the cloud, I might have seen it for 5 seconds It was moving east to west, about the same speed of the aircraft  around it.I thought,how can all these aircraft not see this?I\u2019d say it was 20-30thousand ft high, may be 20 miles out. The airliners were barely visible other than a con trail. This object was a lot bigger,maybe as big as 6 greyhound buses, big enough to see in detail It seemed to be 1 dimension,there were 3 separate  rotating screens[blue like the sky with small clouds inside ringed by this flowing silver[that's where the mercury comes in] I was alone [unfortunately] I only saw one. I mentioned  it to my son afterwards and  he found a picture  on u-tube, they called it a helix. A grainy picture  but the same shape. I\u2019ve thought about going back to that spot ,under the same conditions and looking for it .The experience has been both exciting and a little scary.Was it some sort of craft or a portal?I\u2019v often looked into the night sky and wondered are we alone?Now I know we\u2019re not.One odd thought I did have, the other day my wife and I were headed south on I 95,got to this exit and I wondered aloud,where did that saying every cloud has a silver lining originate?  I\u2019v been married  33yrs,raised two sons, I do have a web site mrcanoe.com.I would be happy to answer any questions.

Traveling east bound on Hwy. 65 looking due south at appx. 20:15 hrs just passing Sunset Blvd. Still looking south just behind William Jessup College observed two single lighted aircraft rising from horizon level into the night sky to an altitude of appx. 100 to 150 feet. Both aircraft seperated in formation to begin areial manouvers of independent origin.  At first these manouvers seemed to be something that could only be achieved by a smaller remote control aircraft, tight and close quarter turns, loops and various synchronized aerobatics. As I was traveling at a rate of sixty-five miles an hour, I had to concentrate on driving while still trying to observe the aircrafts. Leaving the boundries of Rocklin and heading east towards Lincoln, I turned right onto Sterling Parkway and made the first right into a stripmall parking lot with a fairly unobstructed view to the southeast where I could observe the crafts. I watched as the aircraft which only appeared as ! a single color of white then turning to red was joined by a third craft now engaging ib the same acrobatic flight patterns as the other two.  Other observerers pulled into the stripmall parking areas but observed from different vantage points.  Another vehichle pulled up by my car and we observed the air-ballet together. We both noted that crafts each only had a single light that changed colors at intermitten intervals. ( Which were compared to other aircraft  that would randomly pass overhead  with traditional blinking red and white lights found on todays aircraft. We noted we did not know of anytype of aircraft that could make those sort of manouvers short of an Apache or AH-6 Littlebird yet even though they were at a guesstimated five miles or further away, no sounds were heard. After twenty minutes observing the crafts, they dropped below the horizon not to be seen again. After waiting a short period to see if they would return, they did not and the woman and her daughter! said they were returning to their home in Paradise to watch t! he late news to see of any reportings as I said I would also do. KCRA channel 3 news reported nothing of the sightings.",

Earlier this morning I was talking to my husband, and behind him through my living room window I saw a UFO.  This UFO was a teal/green-ish color.  It had a big circle in the center with about six smaller green circles equally spaced around the larger, center circle.  There was no visivle connection, so I don't know if it was one UFO, or seven of them with one mother ship sort of thing. When I stood up to show my husband, his mother, and two sibilings the object vanished.  I nearly began to cry from the shock I was in.",

As soon as I saw this new star adjacent to Big Dipper, I focused and watched intently.  For approximately three to five seconds   It appeared stationary then started moving toward me in a south easterly direction.  It was the same brightness and size of the other Big Dipper stars.  It flew relatively slowly across the sky and was easy to track.  I watched it for 30 seconds and watched it fade out after it crossed California's central valley and approached Sierra Nevada mountains or above Auburn, California.  I noticed It had some bulk to it as It got closer and overhead, like a square with rounded corners but still looking like a star.  Looked at my watch after fade out, 12:01 AM June 18, 2012.",

My Husband and I were cruising around town on August 12, 2013 around 9:30PM when we noticed a flashing red, blue and green object in the sky over a small section of town called Sun City.  It would fly up, hover for a bit and then fall.  When I witnessed the first \u201cfall\u201d of the object, I thought for sure it was a plane crashing. However, after its\u2019 rapid descent, the object returned back into the sky.  My Husband and I followed the object, where it passed over into the Twelve Bridges section of Lincoln, CA.   We stopped the car and got out\u2026 the object slowly came towards our car, then hovered right above us.  I am unsure how high in the sky it was, all I know is it had very vibrant red, blue and green glow to it.  When I say it was flashing colors, there were not just a few lights, the entire object was glowing the colors. I stood there staring at the object for about 10 minutes as it just hovered above me, a car approached over the hill and I looked away from the object for a minute.  When I turned back I noticed it rapidly moving away from us back towards the original sighting area where it ultimately disappeared . I attempted to chase the object again in my car, however, my attempts to find it again failed.",

      "story": "west to east in the midwest My husband and I were walking through southwestern Nebraska streets when I was compelled to turn around and look up. There was a bright, gold, asterisk-looking light moving from west to east across the night sky.  This was last Monday June 17th between 10:00pm and 12:30am central time.   I pointed out the light to my husband and we stopped for a bit to \u201clet it catch up to us\u201d as we were walking in an easterly direction. It moved very fast across the sky; too high and irregular to have been a satellite or asteroid. I began talking to it; telling the beautiful light that \u201cwe're trying to be in peace; we know it looks bad with all the war and whatnot, but we really have peace in our hearts.\u201d  Then it stopped and descended very fast and the glow was brighter, with the scatter pattern of light getting bigger and brighter.  I continued talking to this thing/entity/ship/etc.  It moved from east to west; every once in a while along its flight path it would wiggle from south to north a tiny bit, and then continue along a very definable straight course. It lasted about 3 minutes, and we have been looking up around that time periodically throughout the last week and they appear to be showing up between the hours of 11:30pm and 12:30 am CST in the southeastern Nebraska area. Unfortunately, our camera is not fancy enough to catch these things; anyone have stills or even a video? Please share. Coincidentally, we saw a youtube video tonight of a similar occurrence in Brazil:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmpj7MqBAAk&list=FL02hH42H4ErIA4OQ1twIdpQ&index=1  The one we saw did not come as close, but appears to be similar in presentation, technology and design.  Anyone else seeing these in the midwest over the past 2 weeks?   On that night we also saw 2 lights hover, and then the one nearest to the horizon shot out an orangish-reddish blinking light, or drone, or plane of some sort which then traveled in a southwesterly direction.  It appeared to be cloaking itself as an everyday plane, but we saw where it came out of: the light that at first appeared to be a very bright star.  Over the course of that night, we saw many star ships.  It was unlike anything else I've ever seen.",

My neighbor was driving into the parking lot at that time.  As I was telling her what happened from my car, the object reappeared again.   I got out of my car.  The circular white light then moved towards us in the same manner it did before until it appeared it was around fifty yards away from us.   A third witness also viewed the object from his balcony.   The object stopped again and shot up into the sky in the same manner it had before.   We waited a few hours for it to come back but it never did.",

Lincoln Vt At 23:11, August 3, 2015, in South Lincoln, VT, clear night with a few spotted clouds after a day of thunderstorms.   I went out to pet the dog, and was looking due west, when I spotted 3 large and bright, turquoise, oval lights.  They appeared as though the light was blocked by a cloud, the color was foggy and diluted.  They where very large and bouncing about darting across the sky in an irregular and excessively speedy flight pattern.  The three lights appeared to be  all the same and very close to me.  The visible aspects where only the large (dime sized) turquoise balls of fading light.  The three always staying close to each other making irregular circles around each other.   I went inside to freak out (the dog was unfazed) and grabbed my boyfriend and told him to come look.  He was convinced they where drones, but I'm not convinced at all.  I went inside and brought my iPhone out and took a video, but the ovals where not bright enough.  As I took this video, a plane was flying directly overhead, much higher in the sky and clearly and airplane, you can hear it in the recording.  This only showed a greater and obvious comparison between the two, I compared them on my video.  I also witnessed a strange phenomenon of light reflecting off of the plane passing over head, very high above, and much higher than the 3 ovals.  As the plane passed over my roof top directly next to me, a bright white light reflected off my house-I think it was unrelated but also something I had never seen before.  I tried again with to video it with my Canon rebel, same struggle with a dark image.   I then went back inside to ask my boyfriend to check them out again at about 23:26 and they where gone and the sky had gone dark.",

There were no red or green identifiers or strobes.  The lights did not appear to be on the outside of the object, but more like the dim  light you would expect coming from windows.

We all were just chillin/hanging out, looking for meteors.. which I had never seen before, so it was very cool.  I was laying on the ground on my back, and I had two friends on the bench and the others were just standing around at the time. my friend was saying there was this super bright light that was rising across the lake.  I got off the ground to see what she was talking about, because she was trying to figure out if it was actually rising or if it was a meteor or what. so we all started watching this bright light and at first it kind of looked like it could belong to a tower or something... but then it started rising way more over the trees... same size same brightness... and we were just like what is that... and then it start! ed coming toward us...like it all of a sudden was hovering over the middle of the lake it came from being the bright light rising then all of sudden was right over the lake:.. I was saying holy **** like we are going to get sucked up, like I didn't know what we were going to do, it was very low to the ground compared to how you see objects fly.... but then it just flew right over our heads .... it was a triangle and had green red and white lights or something along those lines... they were verryyy bright and they had a few different colors which I think was green red and white but maybe was plus or minus a color ... anyways I couldn't stop thinking about this and like what the heck was that so I googled if anyone else has seen anything like that and found this website",

Was seen looking to the north-northeast, completely overcast skies, looked to be a fair distance off. 2 balls, one red and flickering white, and one blue flickering white slowly moved across the sky, for some time I thought they were planes, but they continued to move around each other, one plunged to the ground before the two appeared to fuse, one may have just moved away,  as I took time to tell someone and ask them to come look. The ball then became solid white and moved with high speed.  Before about ten minutes after the event started, the object seemed to move closer at high speed, before turning around and staying in near the same location for around 5 minutes.  It also caused my cats to become distressed and worried, one of them constantly looking out the northeast facing windows of my house.

It isn't uncommon to see drones because Beale AFB is 10 miles north of my house.  But something about this one was different.  This one seemed to be higher up in the sky than normal.  It wasn't flying in a straight line like every one I've seen.  It seemed like it had short burst of speed and would veer to the west when it had a burst.  I decided it was worth watching and so I went out front and watched it until it disappeared.  This one ended up heading North West and ended up heading over the Sierra Nevada mountain range.   There was two times I though I saw a faint blue orb flying next to it.  It might of been a satalight but it never once dimmed like the ones I usually see.  I saw the object for about 5 minutes.   My dad was a pilot and I am obsessed with planes. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date.  PD",

We are about half a mile from a boat launch on Lake Roosevelt.   My mom and I were watching tv at 23:55 or 11:55pm, when my step dad walks inside the house from the porch.  He says to my mom, \u201cCome listen to this noise, I have never heard anything like it.\u201d   So my mom goes outside with him on the porch.  I do not follow him at first because he was so calm.  Then my mom opens the door and frantically calls out to me, \u201cCome out here as fast as you can!\u201d   I run out to the porch and instantly see this long string of lights in the sky, and there is this loud, ominous, deep vibrating sound that I can feel vibrating though my feet on the deck.  The only way I would be able to describe this sound would be if there was a giant wine glass with a mile wide rim, and a wet finger continuously rubbing along the rim to make this deep low hum. The string of lights are white and flashing or pulsating in what appeared to be a sequence running around the perimeter of a disk.  We could not see the definite outline of the craft because it was dark and also very smoky from recent fires.  But we could tell by the pattern that the lights were moving that it was most likely a disk or ring shape.  The craft looked like it was about a mile long, and maybe 1,000 feet above lake Roosevelt.   We first saw the craft to the east, moving very very slowly.  Its path appeared to be following the curves of lake Roosevelt, headed north, then north west.  We could still hear the hum or vibration from the craft about three or four minutes after it was out of view.  I was in such shock that I could not stop crying my eyes out.   My mom tried to calm me down by reminding me that the day before this event, or maybe two days before, the local news station gave a statement from the local air force base, Fairchild Air Force Base, saying that people should expect to see strange aircraft maybe even foreign crafts.  But the broadcast was almost in a joking manner.   This changed my mood from scared and sad to scared and mad.  If this was indeed secret military aircraft, how dare they mock our fear when we discover their dark secret of bizarre advanced technology.

A friend, his girlfriend, and myself were standing outside talking, and he pointed the lights out to me at about 02:30.  They were in the southeastern sky (approximately 150 degrees on the compass).   The right and left lights were only very slightly one above the other with the left one being a tad higher.  The left light would wobble back and forth and up and down but the right light was as steady as a rock.  It seemed to be getting closer as we headed inside after watching them for a good ten minutes.   We did not hear any planes passing with in hearing distance.  When we returned outside 30 minutes later we could no longer see the lights.  The right hand light was fairly steady, the left hand light seemed to get a tad brighter and then darker.   I look at stars fairly frequently.  I checked my astrolabe app to ensure the lights weren't stars or planets.  I'm skeptical of it being a ufo, but I couldn't really come up with a good explanation for it.   I wish I had gotten it on camera, but I figured my camera would ((not work well)) in the dark.

I was living in Lincoln Nebraska at the time.  I do recall it was winter and I was headed to the mall so I'm assuming it was before Christmas. The skies in the Midwest during the winter are different than the skies in the PNW.  They are always clear and the sun shines, regardless of the deepness of the snow and ice or how low the freezing temps are. Anyway, I was headed to the mall on a flat and very open stretch of road. The area had not been completely developed yet.  I looked up, I saw something circular and metallic looking in the sky...what I'm assuming to be VERY far up there.  I really have no way to judge its distance.  I followed the bend in the road which made it to where I'd be on the \"side\" of the object...the object had vanished.  Continued following the road which lead to another bend which put me back in \"front\" of the object and there it was.  It appeared to me that it was as thin as a piece of paper to completely vanish when looking at it from the side. I made it to the mall, did shopping and left.  I'm assuming I was there 90 minutes to 2 hours. I took the same path home.  The same round, metallic, flat object was there again.  I'm sure I ended up telling everyone I know the next couple of days and continue to tell people.  I only just found this website this evening or I would have reported it years ago. Truth is I lean more to the notion that it was a portal or wormhole if you will, and with science recently discovering their existence, short appearance and unpredictability, I'm certain that's what it was...but maybe not.",

Tonight, around 8:30pm, I had this urge to look out our back sliding glass door, and to my surprise, I saw the full moon and it seemed bigger/closer than usual and extremely bright!  So bright that it not only gave more light into the sky, but it also produced a ring shape light onto the ground and the middle was shadowed.  I told my mom & step dad then returned to the door to admire the strangeness to it.  I glanced up to the right of the moon and that\u2019s when I saw the first craft.  It was very close at first, there was no sound from it, I could see 3 different color lights that appeared to be spinning in a circle, most were white but there was at least 1 blue and 1 red light,  I yelled for my step dad to come see it because it was just hovering in the air.  It didn\u2019t appear to be moving at first and a few minutes later you could see it gradually moving farther away and upward into the sky.  It would also move slightly right or left.  It wasn\u2019t going fast like it had a des! tination to get to but seemed to be scanning the area.  Once it was too far to see all three lights as well as when it was close another aircraft showed up from the right.  This one did have a faint sound and was going quite fast.  It only had a white light, the light would flash once disappear and then flash again when it got some distance away.  It went right in front of the first craft slightly turned flying left under the moon & right above the tree line.  It then stayed in one area but going upwards and downwards until it just disappeared.  A few minutes later i saw the same flashing light craft much farther left, it was going slow at first, but sped up to disappear around the side of the house.  During all of this the other one was still just hovering in the same spot, it would get a little closer and then go back farther/higher again.  It continued to do this, around 10 I had to stop looking to put my son to bed.  I kept checking until 10:30pm or 11 and that\u2019s when it was fin! ally out of sight.  This sighting was the most amazing for me because t his craft didn\u2019t seem to mind that it was seen and it stayed hovering around the same area the longest amount of time I\u2019ve ever seen any kind of craft do..  while the others seemed to make sure it was not in any danger.  Myself, my mom, step dad and 3 year old all got a great look at this amazing sighting & were all amazed by it.  My puppy also broke off his chain around the time this first occurred, we usually hear him barking or running around the house when this happens but he was extremely calm and was drawn to the ring light & would look toward the craft.",
