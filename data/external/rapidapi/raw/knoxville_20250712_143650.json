The whole week at night in the skies over Oakridge and Cumberland Gap counted at least forty ships.  See at min at least ten every night in Knoxville area.  Some come down to about 30,000 feet and are very large craft bigger than a 747.  I was an aircraft controller and saw many craft while in the military 1971-1974 on radar in Germany and was told to ignore them. They were very high speed aircraft that could cover the 250 mile distance on my scope in less than a blink of an eye. We have nothing that fast.  Something is definitely going on in Knoxville area and should be investigated with cameras. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

The front of it was green and then it tapered into orange, there was much more orange than green.  It wasn't a green object with an orange tail because the whole thing moved together as one object.  There was no noise.  The way it appeared it reminded me of shooting a bottle rocket.  Only it was huge.  And going down not up.  And it never exploded like a bottle rocket.  We both were silent for a few minutes and then we looked at each other.  I asked what that was, she said she didn't know.  I asked if she thought it was a plane.  She said no.  I said maybe fireworks.  She said no.  Then she said sort of quietly do you think it was a ufo?  I said no one would believe us.  We quickly put out our cigarettes and went back in.",

It looked like a circular white light with a smaller red light towards the top of it.  It seemed to have a slight disc shape, but due to distance and my glasses lenses, it was hard to tell if it was a glare from my glasses or simply a blur from the distance.  It made no noise. it stopped in place for a few moments before beginning to accelerate incredibly quickly and make super smooth and quick turns.   It was hard to tell the speed of the object, since it was so far away, but it did go significantly faster than any aircraft I have ever seen before and it was silent.  It continued in that pattern, occasionally stopping in place.  Eventually, it disappeared behind some trees and emerged a few minutes later, but this time it was blinking like a plane would, but it continued the irregular movements from before.  It disappeared again behind the same trees and then soon emerged again, now it wasn\u2019t blinking but was a solid light like before, but we saw it change to start to blink again.   It then drifted back down to the same general area it initially rose up from, and me nor my sister saw it again.",

We pulled over on the side of the road, where both of my children exited the vehicle to begin recording the strange phenomenon.  My husband also began recording the lights in the sky from inside the vehicle.  There were two large orange lights that would leap in equal intervals from one and other.  Each would leave a tail of smaller orange dots and then disappear for approximately \u00bd of a second before reappearing and leaping west again.  The lights would make a rapid movement and then stop.  At one point both of the larger lights collided and went dark.  Again within a split second the! lights reappeared with the tails of smaller lights and began moving westward again.  As we proceeded South on Knox Station Road, the lights never appeared to become closer.  They were very bright and were very apparent in the night sky even with a cell phone tower below them and a \u00be moon.  At approximately 9:38 pm CST, the lights vanished from the sky.",

I won't go into the details of how I arrived at that date - I do not actually remember the exact date.  I had gone to my parent's home to pick up my son - he rode the school bus and stayed at their house until I got off from work.  They needed a few items from the grocery store (about a mile and a half from their house) and I volunteered to go get them.  My son was with me.  As we drove down the road, I saw two  ojects in the sky.  They were flying at tree-top level. They made no sound. They were silvery in color.  The looked like two saucers laid rim to rim.  They had red, white and green lights. The white lights were around the middle - windows were also visible around the middle.  I stopped the car - flashed my headlights - and watched them. Nothing happened.  I continued on my way to the store.  I asked the cashier at the store if she saw the UFO's and she looked at me as if I had two heads (or no brain) and has yet to answer,  I decided at that time not to pursue it any further. I could see no movement inside the closest craft; although it seemed as if I could see in the windows.  The next day an article was in the Knoxville News-Sentinel relating a similar sighting in a nearby county by two police officers.  They described the lights as patriotic - red, white and blue.  I did tell my parents of the sighting. My mother scoffed.  My father stated he saw them all the time in the back yard in the evening when he was feeding the animals.  A few years ago, I remembered that after I flashed my headlights (which I had to turn on to do so), and continued down the road that I had to turn on my headlights as it was now getting dark.  I don't know if any time was lost - my parents didn't say anything about being gone a great length of time.  They are both now deceased so it will be impossible to get that input.  My son says he still remembers the UFO's - he was about 8 years old at the time - he will be 39 this August. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

As I was quickly processing this info, I happened to look up and saw five very bright blue lights absolutely zoom across the night sky, in single file formation, without making a sound.  When I noticed the lights, they were almost directly overhead, perhaps a few thousand feet in the air, and they disappeared after only a few seconds, as they vanished into the distance.   I could not tell whether they simply flew out of view, or actually turned off, but they had obviously been visible before I noticed them overhead, as their light was so bright that, in the few seconds before I looked up, I had felt their light all the way down to ground level.  At the same time, a neighbor across the street was out on her porch, calling her dogs in, and after they disappeared from view, I asked her if she had seen the same thing I had just witnessed.  She said that she had.  I asked her what she thought it was, and she had no idea.

They don\u2019t leave any kind of trail behind them.  They don\u2019t make straight lines either.  They either zig zig or circle around. My husband has seen them once before, but I don\u2019t remember the date or time.",

At first I thought it was a plane with alot of lights. Then I noticed the lights seperating.It looked like a plane ontop of a plane. Then I noticed that both objects were triangel. One had three white lights in front,a red light in back. The other on had two red lights and one big flashing light in the front with a red flashing light in the back.  The one that was on top and seperated from the bottom one took off to the left so fast it was gone in a blink. I pulled off the road to watch the other one still in sight it was standing still. Then in a matter of 30sec it was clear to the south headed toward a town called Abingdon, Illinois.  I dont beleive in UFOs,bur what I saw didnt look like planes.

I live in a rural neighborhood in central Maryland at an elevation of about 500 ft..  The Blue Ridge Mountains are about 1 \u00bd mile west and the South Mountains are about \u00bc mile east.  The Potomac River is about 1 mile south.  I am a 58 year retired social worker with a masters degree.  This is my first report of an unidentified object seen in the sky. On 11-25-08 at about 7:15 p.m., I was shutting my backyard gate in the dark, facing west towards Elk Ridge (in the Blue Ridge Mts., about 1400 ft. elevation) which runs roughly southwest to northeast.    As I looked up, I saw a lighted object rapidly descending at about a 45 degree angle below the ridge line at a very rapid rate of speed.  I only saw it for about three seconds before it dropped behind the roof line of a neighbor\u2019s house.  The object\u2019s speed was much faster than planes, helicopters, or fireworks that are occasionally seen in the area.  My estimation is that the lighted object was in the valley, about \u00bd to 1 mile from my house. The lighted object was oblong in shape, wider at the end headed downward, like an elongated teardrop.  In relation to how the moon appears in our sky, the length was about the diameter of the moon, with a tail of more diffused light extending further out.  The width was about a third of the moon\u2019s diameter.  The color reminded me of a Halloween glow-stick, so it had a florescent look.  The only sound I noted was that of distant barking dogs, off to the northeast towards the ridge. I have never seen anything like this before.  The lighted object was seen with the mountain range as a back drop.   I am frequently outside, day and night, caring for horses and have a familiarity with the sights and sounds of the area.  This was certainly out of the ordinary and I have no idea what I saw.",

I am posting this because neither of us can think of who you call and there have to be other people who saw this. It was over our neighborhood near a large shopping area, but our neighborhood is still darker at night which we guess is why we could see the object. It was black-ish with what looked like moving/flipping panels that would catch the light as it moved or reflected some light we could not see. When he first saw it he thought it was birds, but there was no bird sound and then we both realized how large it was. And that it was diamond shaped. Plus it was blocking out the sky as it moved. As it moved away I could hear a hush noise, like snow flakes or a low white noise sound. He did not pick that up, but we both know my ears are more sensitive and he is getting over a cold. Also as it moved away it turned into a triangular shape and we could really see the tile-like things flipping. The object was moving overhead toward the downtown of the city we live outside of, so a straight line following a major interstate seemed to be its path or to pass over the interstate at some point. East-Northeast(emphasis on East). It left behind a massive white trail similar to what planes can leave behind but huge. My husband wants me to add that it was not like an exhaust trail, but more like displacement? No other way to explain how it looked or felt but displacement. Also as it was moving it passed in front of a plane that was much higher up and the object totally blocked the light out of the plane. I always carry a strong flash light when we walk at night and it did not even reflect off of this object. Either it was much higher up, which means it was even larger than we think, or it was non-reflective. We watched it from tonight 7:07 pm until 7:09 when it moved out of our field of vision. It became a straight line like this but massively thick ______. It seemed as though one of the diamond's points flattened to make the triangle and then the the front point of the triangle flattened to make a wide line. If you have ever seen ticker tape or confetti that was how the tile thing looked when they were moving. Birds do not have exhaust and that trail was not there until the object went by. No air craft we know of is that quiet, I am a Military Brat and have grown up around planes so I know their sounds. It can't have been a Stealth because we would have felt that and it would have to have been really low to block the sky in the way it did. No way we could not have felt it were a low flying Stealth! Also we realized after we saw the trail that in fact there were two other trails spaced evenly and parallel to the one this craft made.",

There were a few stars off to the left & then I started looking for possible planes in the sky for a reference (since we are only a couple miles form the McGhee Tyson Airport & Air National Guard Post.

Now the light I saw hadn't moved but say 1000 yards from where I saw it and It was Glowing Bright White light ~ NO FLASHING NO COLORS what so ever ~ it seemed to move only in left to right and right left a couple of times in very short distances ~ I watched it for about 10 minutes and then realized what I was seeing ~ I took out my phone which has a camera and clicked 4 quick photos ~ and to my amazement two of the photos showed the light as red and one of them showed blue and one showed nothing like it wasn't there ~ About this time 2 EMT'S came out of the E.R. heading to the Ambulance and I yelled at them and asked if they could see that light in the sky ~ They were both like \"WOW\" what is that? Now this thing was about 2000 ft. to 3000 ft. in the air ~ I have done skydiving before and have a pretty good idea about heights , it is a guess but pretty close none the less.Neither of them had any idea what it was & they both stated that they had seen numerous Helicopters at night for pickup at accidents & at crime scenes with Police Helicopters & they both were like \"That's Chopper\" I continued to watch the light still only white to my eyes & theirs. It was so bright it almost hurt to look at it to long I watched for about 10 more minutes then \"poof\" it was gone. Nothing , it never came back and I couldn't find it anywhere in the s! ky I wen t up to the 3rd floor observatory and scanned the entire sky for 15 minutes and saw nothing except a couple small jets going in for landing at McGhee Tyson.Now I live here and we see all kinds of Military Helicopters and C130's also refueling Cargo Planes and lotsa local air traffic dailey.

I don't know much about astronomy but I do know that there aren't that many planets to be seen that well, not to mention these \"stars\" were very close to one another.   After a couple minutes of trying to figure out what they could be they began to move.  They had been fixed in the sky and now were moving towards one another.  They were in very close proximity and moving all around each other.  The best way to describe them is to compare them to gnats or moths flying around a light source only a lot slower.  When they first started moving I thought maybe they were lights from helicopters but I don't think helicopters fly that close to one another and not in those kinds of patterns.  After 30 seconds or so of being confused by what I was watching they moved, in unison and fairly quickly, over the tree-line and I could no longer see them.  These objects never made a noise that I could hear.  I am generally a skeptic when it comes to UFOs but I am really perplexed by what I saw.

Other long contrails were visible in other areas of the sky, particularly to the south.  The altitude of the three contrails seemed to be similar to typical jet contrails. The three contrails seemed unusual to me.  The contrail lengths were relatively short compared to others in different areas of the same sky.  The two most westward contrails were relatively close and in parallel.  A third contrail was close behind.  After observing these objects for about 20 to 30 seconds, it then appeared that there were actually four contrails.  The fourth contrail seemed to be close to the forward two.  The flight paths were apparently straight and the movement seemed to be consistent with high altitude aircraft speed which I have routinely observed. These contrails apparently were evaporating rather quickly.  After about 60 to 90 seconds after the initial observation, the contrails disappeared, one by one.  The last one observed was the trailing contrail. At this point, my initial impression was this phenomena could have been some type of debris entering the earth\u2019s atmosphere and breaking into three or four relatively large pieces.  I was not able to determine if the contrails were actually due to aircraft.  I did not have access to any type of optical devices or cameras.  There was no observed points of light associated with the contrails. There was one other observer besides myself.  My background is in chemistry and radiological safety.  The other observer is a registered land surveyer. My question would be, \"Has any local radar station observed these objects at this location and time and made any identification?\" A response via email would be welcome if this observation warrants an investigation.",

What i saw changed my life, my perception of how i understood physics, and what i once viewed as possible and impossible.  I have always been interested in the paranormal, since my first memories i can recall an interest in ghosts, spirits, angels aliens etc.. but overall i am a pretty sound and logical person.  The details of my first sighting were pretty much exactly the same as what is described by eyewitnesses of the famous Phoenix lights, but that's not why I'm here.  I'm here because this morning at 1:30am, I witnessed something that frightened me to my very core.  Unlike my other UFO sighting experiences in which i was not frightened, just fascinated and curious about the possibilites of what i was seeing i felt a combination of peace, warmth, and awe. what i witnessed tonite was completely different.  I had just gotten home from a little late night shopping at wal-mart.  The time was around 1:30am and i was walking out of my bathroom and down the stairs to my basement to smoke a cigarette, when i heard a very loud rumble as if a tornado was directly over my home.  It was such a loud humming/rumbling sound that i could literally feel the vibration from it.  Curious, i walked out my front door expecting to see a helicopter flying directly over or a low flying jet, but... that is not at all what i saw.  I open the door, and directly in front of my point of view was an ENOURMOUS, solid carbon/black perfect circle shaped craft hovering extremely low and close to my home. The sound was loud enough that i'm surprised... better yet shocked that it didn't wake the whole neighborhood.   Again, this thing was huge.  In the dead center of this giant circular craft (Which i could see almost perfectly, and it had no wings, no landing gear, no strobing lights and no visible markings of any kin! d) was an extremely bright laser like lighting blue beam pointing in several different directions. I have to admit, i was frightened by it, but i wanted to document it somehow. Now, i own a video camera, but i keep forgetting to purchase new film, and did not have any in it at the time, which REALLY sucked. So, since option 1 was out of the question i ran to get my iphone from off my counter top. Here's what is strangest part of the story. By the time i got back outside with my phone in hand, this thing, this craft, this... sort of ominous eye of god ship had left. I could still hear it, it was still very loud, and knew it had to be near by. Mind you, I was in the house for all of 15 seconds searching for my iphone. I ran as fast as i could in house shoes around to the back of my house hoping to catch a final glimpse. This craft (or whatever you want to call it) had traveled several miles north, and all i could see was the faint remnant of the beam shooting out of it, and i! t was rotating up and down and back in forth as if it was sear! ching fo r something, and then it dissapeared behind the ridgeline, although the noise emminating was still very noticeable. Wait it gets weirder. SO i hear another loud rumble coming from behind me, althought this sound is familiar. I look up, and there 3 black helicopters with only their spotlights on in formation flying along the same path the craft took, as if they were chasing after it. These choppers were hauling major ass. I knew i had just witnessed something i was not supposed to see. I will remember this day forever, and the unusual ominous sense of fear i got from witnessing this thing. If you would like, i am a bit of an artist, i could send a detailed sketch at a later date. Thank you for your time.",

Then we thought about an orb of purple light , like I said we cannot decide whether it is an orb of paranormal light or a U.F.O. We got this spot of light when we were taking pictures of the moon, and like we said we took about five photos and they were about three minutes apart and this one is the only one that it showed up on.

Tonight my husband and I just witnessed what might be described as a fireball in the Farragut/Concord area just southeast of Turkey Creek and Concord Roads at about 21:15 tonight. We were walking eastward on Turkey Creek Road just east of Anchor Park when we realized that the bright object in the sky above was not a helicopter or airplane.  The center of the roughly spherical object blazed bright orange at first.  It had a dark, slightly irregular outer edge.  It appeared to be spinning. This went on for maybe a minute at most and then the bright center quickly died out and all that was left was a dark, cinder-like spinning object, possibly spherical or disc shaped, that slowly lost altitude as it drifted roughly southwest and was lost to our sight as it descended in the direction of Northshore Drive.  It made no discernible sound. We do not know if there is any relation, but there has been a bad smell in the area this evening - possibly a chemical odor or the smell of something burning.",

My son and I were heading home from taking care of our horse.  As I was driving, I observed Jupiter in the sky to the front right of my car. As I rounded a curve in the road, I noticed a extremely bright blue light thru the tree tops to my left.  I have driven down this road countless times in the past year and I knew that light wasn't there before.  I said to my son\" what is that blue light over there, do you see it?\"  He replied \"ya, I see it.  I don't know what it is.''   We then came to a point in the road where we could pull on a side street.  We sat there for a minute and watched in wonder.  This bright object was moving from side to side, even doing a \"figure eight\". I drove a little further down the street to get closer to it.  We sat and watched it for another minute, then it just blinked out.  Gone.  And before I could say anything, it was back, bright as ever, just in a different spot.  I'm sure this was the same object we had been watching. To me, the shape was oval, but there was a time or two when it moved it almost seems to get longer.  We had the windows in the car down,there was not any noise that we could hear. Ok, so I really wanted the validation of another person.  I tried to flag a car down, they wouldn't stop.  Cant say I blame them, but that didn't stop me from flagging another car down.  He did stop. I said \"thanks for stopping, and i know this is going to sound crazy, but do you see that blue light up there?\" as i pointed to it.  He looked and said \"yes\". I said \"don't you think that it looks weird, the way its moving?\"  I believe his reply was \"  I think its a police helicopter\".   Um.... Are you kidding me? My father is a pilot, fixed wing and helicopter.  I grew up in a plane. I'm pretty confident I could figure that out myself if that was the fact.  The guy was still watching the object and then he says \"maybe it a searchlight, ya know, like when a new place opens and they want to draw attention\".    Well, Im pretty sure those lights just don't stop and make a oval in the sky.  There was no ceiling....no clouds. Nothing for the light to bounce off .  Disappointed that the guy wa! s not as amazed as we were, I told him thank you for stopping, and he drove off.  I hope he got down the street and looked up at it one more time. We rushed home to get the camera, but of coarse, it was gone when we returned.  I even dragged my grumpy husband out of the house to go driving around to look for it.  Im bringing my camera with me from now on.",

      "story": "Strange orange lights over Knoxville, TN While watching fireworks, a light caught our attention which appeared to be a flare at first. It was orange in color and seems to glimmer like a flame.  However, we begin to watch as it moved across the sky beyond our view.   It appeared to be high in the sky.  Roughly 10 minutes later another \"orange flare\" came across the sky following the same pattern almost, it too flew out of view as the first.   As it flew overhead, binoculars form within the house were obtained.  View through binoculars, the object was very hard to focus in on remaining blurry.   Approx. 10 minutes later another flew in about the same path and direction as the previous. This time, this particular \"orange flare\" was moving faster than the others coming from the same direction and going towards the same direction as the other.  (The direction these things were going was from the North - Northeast moving towards the southwest - sometimes turning west).  This one slowed down and appeared to come to ! a complete stop while still glowing orange.   A minute or two later, the item began to move in a western direction and slowly began to disappear until it was gone.  Once it disappeared, another came into view across the sky to the north again - it followed the same path.  This point was when the choice to grab the telescope was made.   However, as the telescope was being sought after, two more objects appeared outside. This time as one went across (same direction) another appeared across the sky in the direction they were coming from making visible two of these objects at one time.   These objects were photographed and caught on video (phone).  However, watching the video and film afterwards, it is very hard to see what was actually seen.  Describing the view through binoculars - the objects appeared to be an orange spot light moving from side to side almost.  It was very hard to focus in on the objects.  The sky was clear except for some smoke in the southern portion of the sky from t! he fireworks - however, these objects moved through clear skie! s.   When the one object stopped, we observed a plane flying from the east to west and appeared to be flying toward the direction; however, when the plane flew by the object - you could tell the plane was much higher than the object.  However, it seemed weird that object slowed and stopped as the plane approached and as soon as the plane passed over head of the object, that is when the object begin moving in the westerly direction as the same as the plane, then vanished.  Further research on the internet mentioned items such as Chinese lanterns which may be possible - not sure because we have never seen them but the objects were weird as they seemed to be moving at various speeds and the one that stopped.  We have never seen anything like this before. The first two objects came from the North and traveled in a southwestern direction.  The remaining objects came from the Northeast and traversed in a southwestern direction except for the one object that stopped and changed to a western direction.  All objects except the first vanished or disappeared in the sky in view, while the first vanished behind the house out of view.   The object emitted no noise from at least what we could tell - there were fireworks going off in the distance and the booming of those were heard, however, when the plane flew by, we could hear that.  The objects were very hard to focus on and appeared blurry even through the binoculars; however they were very bright in color and looked like flares in a way but without the excessive smoke or flame appearance flares give off - the same color though.   The first two were moving about the same speed and the third that stopped was moving very fast before it slowed to a stop.  The remaining was various speeds but no! t as fast as the third.  The items were viewed from about 2115 hours to approx. 2215 hours.   The objects appeared as circle type and blurry. We stayed out until 2250 hours waiting for more but no more were observed.",

We were driving home from dinner on Tuesday, September 18, 2012. At approximately 9:00-9:15 p.m. we witnessed an event we have ever seen before. My boyfriend's recollection of the event is a little different than mine. That is why I want to include both of our reports as two different testimonials for the same event. Here is his report: &quot;I am typing this report at 10.30 pm est September 18, 2012. My girlfiend and I were driving home from dinner at about 9:00pm est. We live in Knoxville, TN in an area about 20 miles from McGee-Tyson Airport. We are used to seeing airplanes fly over our neighborhood all the time, and this sighting was absolutely not an airplane. It moved too fast in the sky and in a very strange manner. I am not sure what I witnessed was from another world or something the government may be doing, but it was definately something I have never seen before. It was pitch black outside, and just as we were coming over a steep hill on our way home, I witnessed two distinctively bright lights that appeared to be changing colors from orange- to red- to green. They were very bright, brighter and larger than any other star or plane in the sky. What I witnessed lasted from about 5 to 8 seconds, it was very brief. However, I can say there was no avoiding seeing this because it was obvious something was happening that was not normal. The two lights moved higher in the sky in a coordinated effort, then crossed each other. First making arches in the sky, then creating an &quot;X&quot; path in the sky. The two lights then came together, stopped and held their spots, then took off at opposite directions a speed I have never witnessed. There was also a truck down the road from us that was stopped. We drove towards them, they rolled down their window and told us that they had witnessed the same thing. This was, by far, the strangest thing I have ever seen. The \u201corbs\u201d (as some people have been referring to them) were in the southeastern night sky.&quot; In addition to my boyfriend's report above, I wanted to give my own testimonial for this event: We were coming home from dinner at around 9pm on September 18th. We were coming over a steep hill, and I could see in the sky, much much higher than the tallest trees, two very bright lights. They were circular &quot;orbs&quot;, I guess some people have been calling them. One was red-ish in color and the other was green-ish. They were very bright, much brighter and larger than any star. And they appeared to have a hazy ring around them. What I witnessed only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I know that it was not normal. It was not a star, an airplane, or any other &quot;normal&quot; object or light you would expect to see in the night sky. The two lights were moving towards each other, like mirror images. Then they stopped, and separated apart, almost like they were repelled from each other, at a speed I have never witnessed. They moved so fast that you could not keep your eyes on them, then they were simply gone. I did not see the first part where the two lights created arch paths, then &quot;X&quot;ed over each other (as my boyfriend described) because I was looking out the other window, but I did witness the last part of the event, and I can stand with my boyfriend in saying that it was not normal, and something I have never seen before. As soon as this happened, I had a hard time recognizing what happened, I wasn't sure of what I saw, then my boyfriend asked me if I saw it. I immediately knew what he was talking about, and didn't know how to respond. My first response was to call 911 and report it, but we didn't end up doing that. We saw a truck parked down the road of 2 people we have never met. We rolled down our window and they told us they had just witnessed the same event. Basically, I saw one bright red light, or &quot;orb&quot;, and one bright green light. They were large and moved at a speed I have never witnessed before, in the following pattern: First moving towards each other, in a coordinated effort: --&gt;   --&gt;   --&gt;         O    O         &lt;--   &lt;--   &lt;-- When they met, they stopped and held their position, then separated in opposite directions at a speed I have never seen. Exponentially faster than any other airplane: O   &lt;----- &lt;----- &lt;----- &lt;-----       -----&gt; -----&gt; -----&gt; -----&gt;   O Then they were simply gone, nowhere to be seen in the sky. Like I said, what I saw only lasted 1 to 2 seconds, but I do not doubt my boyfriend's testimonial at all. I believe that we saw the same thing, and I believe that he did see the lights first create arch paths in the sky, the &quot;X&quot; over each other. My boyfriend works in sales, and I am a manager at a local company in Knoxville. We make good money. We are not religious, or spiritual, nor are we &quot;UFO hunters&quot;. We have nothing to hide, and we are not looking to be famous. We have never witnessed anything like this before, and we are honest people who just thought that what we saw needed to be reported. After the event, we researched internet sites to report what we saw, and nuforc.org seemed like the only legitimate website we could find. Thank you.",

On the evening of November 14th I was driving home from in the western suburbs of Knoxville, Tennessee on Westland Drive.  I was headed east when I noticed what appeared to be a very low flying airplane in the distance. There is McGhee Tyson airport about 8 miles to the southwest, so I didn't, at that moment, think it was out of the ordinary, except for the altitude it was at.  For the next 45 seconds I had a clear view of this craft. I kept waiting for it to pull away and gain altitude, but as I got closer, I realized that I was gaining on it.  I slowed down as I got closer and realized that it was hovering about what appeared to be 400 feet above the road. It had two white lights on either side of what I first thought were the wings, with a red light blinking in the center.  As I got closer and closer, now only going maybe 20 miles an hour I had a totally clear view of this craft.  As I drove under it, only then was I able to see that it had an oval or rounded shape to the underside of it.  I really wanted to pull over, get out and observe this craft, but I was just a little freaked by the whole experience.  As I drove away I kept looking in my rear view mirror, but never saw the lights or craft again. I would really like to think that it was a plane or helicopter, as it was hovering, but I know of no plane that can do that and I've seen too many 'copters and it made no noise that I could hear. The exact location was on Westland Drive right across from A.L. Lotts Elementary school.",

I believe this was too close to be another airplane.  Also, if it was an airplane, it would not have disappeared. It did not have a trail of any kind. I was the front passenger in the car, and was telling the driver, my sister, to look at the object, and why it did not have a plume, when it completely disappeared.

      "story": "Big reddish-orange (planet-looking) light hovering over Knoxville, TN during 4th of July festivities I'm surprised that no one else mentioned this!   When I lived in Knoxville, TN in 2010, my husband, best friend and I were walking closer and closer to the river during the 4th. of July festivities in World's Fair Park to get a better look at the fireworks.  We kept walking and walking and walking until we got up to a neighborhood right next to the river, and we couldn't walk any further.  There were a whole bunch of people sitting on their front porches, sitting in their front lawns.....etc watching the fireworks.  There was a middle-aged man on the sidewalk with a pet boa constructer, my 19 year old friend was wearing a cute, white sun dress, and she (being the daring type of person that she is) asked the man if she could touch it.  It weighed about 70 lbs, and she was tiny herself, so I was very surprised and completely distracted when the man said, \"Sure,\" and instead, draped the gigantic snake over her shoulders, and she was totally freaking out.  I was kind of giggling and no longer paying attention to the sky and the fireworks when I suddenly noticed everybody walking out into the streets like they were mesmerized or something.  I didn't understand what could've been so wonderful about the fireworks, because I was getting bored with them and paying attention to my friend's nervous reaction.   I suddenly turned to my husband iand asked what the big deal was to notice that he was in a daze staring at the skies as well.  He pointed and said, &quot;Look&quot; while still partially in a trance.  I looked up, and there was this small, but distinctive, ball of a red-orange light that looked like it was far in the distance and getting bigger and bigger as it seemed to be quickly approaching.  I felt like I was dreaming but looked around to realize that everyone else was still looking at it too, which made me realize that it wasn't even close to my imagination!  As I looked back up again, I noticed that it was gigantic. Granted I di! dn't have my prescription glasses on at the time, but to me,  it somewha t resembled a small planet or something, and it seemed like it was so close that I thought that it was going to hit us.  Instead, it seemed as if it was hovering a little bit higher than a high helicopter right in front of everyone in the neighborhood, but over the water.   It hovered over there for a long matter of seconds, and suddenly (out of nowhere), it quickly darted off almost directly right and disappeared in a split second almost as if it never was really there.  Once again, I thought that I was imagining it, and realized that everyone was still standing around looking up at the sky for a couple of seconds after it disappeared. I mentioned that I wished that my son was there to see it as soon as I came to, and I looked back at my friend who still had the snake draped over her as if the snake was barely even phasing her anymore until she 'came to' again, and finally asked the guy to get the snake off of her.",

We pulled into the local gas station parking lot and through the sun roof a brilliant light was shining, almost floating in our direction. We both saw it and I commented to how it was flying very low.  It was not a plane as we saw planes, indicated by blinking lights, flying in the back ground. After parking, instead of rushing to buy lotto tickets, I was curious and wanted to see if I could hear the motor flying the mysteriously bright light.  I  could hear nothing, and I've been known to have keen ears.   My girlfriend and I were just looking at it when I noticed Venus next to the moon.  I know it was Venus because i used a star map app to find out.  As I focused on Venus, with the app, my girlfriend looked away from the shining object. An instant later the brilliant shining light was gone.  I wanted to put the object in the app but no suck luck. We were also out of luck when it came to winning the lottery.

On a Sunday after noon in rural Burlington area of Knoxville, Tn., my little sister and I were in the front yard playing with acorns.  It had rained that day and finally stopped.   We heard a loud noise and saw a thing in the shape of today's stealth jet.  It was silver, with black windows.  It was the size of a medium size car and was able to maneuver in a small area as we were in an area with lots of trees and another small house near by.   It came low, close to my little sister and hovered.  I was on the steps of the front porch and she was in the yard collecting acorns.  I thought it might take her.  Neither of us moved.  We felt no wind or any thing.  I don't remember it being too loud at that time.  It stopped for a time then whooshed away in same direction it came from.   We ran in and told every body about it.  They paid no attention.  We went across the street and talked to a neighbor lady.  She said she heard a noise but may have just said that to make us feel better.  If the two of us had not seen and remembered it, I would think I dreamed it.   We remember it pretty much the same.  My sister was frightened to be alone for a long time.  It was before TV and I only knew it kind of resembled my cousins toy jet.  I had never really seen a jet or even an airplane at the time..   I'm not positive about date as it was years ago, but my sister was not yet in school, and we think it was 1949 or early 1950s.  We wondered if any one else ever saw such a thing.  It stays in our memory fresh like the memory of Kennedy's death. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

Hard to say because it was almost like we was under a trance as we look but was prob just in shock.   I remember we pulled into the parking lot about 30 feet away to get out of the car and the \"ship\" started to move very slowly heading east.  I never seen the ship fly off though, it moved east slowly and then just was not there anymore.  We have told very few people about this over the years in fear.  But if anyone else remembers seeing this in the Knoxville area around that time please note.",

It was a clear night. I looked up and saw about 7 or 8 orange orbs in the sky.  They flew silently and in such even formation that it was as if they had a string attached between them.  They arc'ed up, but not too high in the sky, flying south. My father and mother were in the yard and also saw the flying objects.  When we got inside the house, Dad called the local newspaper to see if anyone else had reported the flying objects, but no one had.   A few days later, I called the airport traffic control center.  They don't handle this kind of thing and suggested calling the UFO hotline.  That's how I came to this site.",

We watched them go Eastward.  I kept watching them and following the jets with my eyes and head and could still hear them as they went by us and now I could see their tail ends, when all of a sudden a white flat circle that was brighter than the white clouds flew across (intercrossed) the tail ends of the jets.  My husband quit watching the jets as they had crossed over him.  He just slightly turned his head to watch them.  The jets were flying one behind the other keeping perfect spacing between each other.  I followed the bright white circle until it went behind a tree that obstructed our view.  The white Circle didn't go behind the tree on purpose, it was just a big tree that was on the side of the house that blocked my view.    My husband watched me stand up and follow the circle with my eyes and he turned to see what I was looking at and pointing at, that's when our view was ob! structed by our tree. The circle was flying as fast and steady as the jets and was very high in the sky. It was a perfect circle, brighter, whiter than a cloud. It looked flat almost like a orb dancing in your vehicle from jewelry or a watch that the sun reflected off of.  The circle didn't fly behind the tree on purpose it was just a big tree beside our house that blocked our view from seeing the circle any longer.  The circle was moving as fast and steady as the jets and was very high in the sky. There was no sound from the circle.  I don't know if the circle came out from a cloud next to the jets or where it came from.  I just began seeing it come from the right side going to the left side of the back end of the jets.  It was a sunny day.  Yes, there was some clouds but sun was shining and the wind was blowing.  My husband didn't see it because he didn't react fast enough and the tree obstruction didn't help.",

      "story": "Saw a very high, black louvred rectangular object headed from S to N at cloud level, over South Knox County. I was about to start sunbathing.  Temp was about 87, partly cloudy day in South end of Knox County.  As I noticed a huge high cloud came across the sun, my eyes focused on something rectangular shaped, at the edge of the cloud height. The object appeared to have a louvred appearance, much like that of a laundry room door or the kind of windows one sees on older homes in a beach area--louvred.  The object appeared to be black, and was headed due North in direction.  It wasn't blown on the wind, in a \"wafting\" type direction, it was on a steady path.  No variation in its path, as I said, just at the edge of the lower level of a white cloud and at that height, it would've had to have been easily 50x100 ft, but looked really tiny from the ground.  To place perspective, when we see a jumbo jet pass near a cloud, it looks like a period on a huge paper.  This object had to be approximately the same dimension, as it was cloud level, just under a huge cloud blocking the sun, had louvres, and was black. I could see that half the louvres went in one direction, the other half in the opposite direction. Very perplexing, and moving quickly.  I couldn't begin to estimate speed, but I know it was definitely going pretty fast, kept its height (no sinking) and kept going due North.  It came from the direction of Maryville and crossed the sky heading toward the NE side of Knoxville City, across the sky. I've never seen anything I could compare it to, except one of those old louvred type doors with horizontal slats running back and forth across the height of the door...matter of fact, that was my first thought when I looked up and focused on it. There's an air-base in Maryville, approx 15 miles from here as a bird flies, but there's no way anything could gain that altitude from lifting off there.  There's an AirForce base there, too. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Ah! Sorry, it was absolutely Aug 10th.  I wonder if it could've been some type of low satellite or drone, perhaps?  Maybe something from Google maps...?  Perplexing. If you do find out anything, or hear of similar reports, keep in contact.  Thanks much! ((END ADDENDUM))",

Because of its velocity, I moved indoors because I was afraid there might be a sonic boom.   There was no boom in my area, but I saw on Twitter last night that there were sonic booms heard in parts of the northeast shortly after I saw this object (confirmed by USGS).  It had to have crashed somewhere; it was spinning out of control. I was by myself.

It looked like a star at first, gleaming, but not huge in the sky. Then it turned towards my left (its right) and looked like some kind of craft. It was not a jet plane.  It looked more cylindrical. The waning sunlight allowed a brief observation. Then it simply disappeared. Amount of time observed:  Maybe 10 seconds; 15 seconds max. There were several jets in the sky at the same time. Their contrails were visible.  This object had no contrail. In fact, there were three jets to the right (north) of this object, all with contrails. From the point of view of this witness, the three jets looked to be almost stacked in the sky. Then this witness had to make a turn onto a road heading north. When lack of trees allowed, I did glance over towards the area. All I saw were jet planes, maybe 8 or 9 of them going different directions. No sign of the object. Thank you very much.

On 26OCT2016, at approximately 2315 EDT, I heard several instances of noises coming from outside of my house.  The noise that most caught my attention was similar to someone riding a skateboard on pavement but was accompanied by a notable amount of low frequency energy as a steady drone, no rhythmic interruptions, just a Doppler effect as through passing slowly by my observation point.   After the third such occurrence in an estimated 15 minute window, I exited my house and attempted to locate the source of these aural events.  Upon looking to the northeast sky, I observed two slow moving, flashing red lights in what appeared to be a loose, staggered formation traveling away from my location in a northeast direction.   The lights pulsed with only a saturated red color in a slow, steady pattern, similar to a communications tower at night.  They were quite intense, despite the perceived distance but were not blinding--certainly brighter than any aircraft I've witnessed.  The lights also flashed in perfect unison with each other but, given the distance separating them in the sky,  I have no reason to believe they were in fact attached to the same craft.   The only sound witnessed as they departed was a low frequency rumble similar to that of a distant freight train, or high powered jet engine.",

      "story": "UFO Fleet of bright green star-like orbs photographed while traveling across downtown Knoxville. I was exiting a restaurant with a friend on Gay Street on 8/19/16 at 8:49 pm in Knoxville TN.  As soon as we stepped out onto the street, I looked North (with my I-Phone 6 in hand) and I was overwhelmed by the sight of a very strange cloud formation.  It had three plumes jetting out of it and there was a ceiling of another cloud above it.  It was so surreal and I said to my friend, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that before in my life!\u201d   At that moment, I had a strange feeling that gave me a sense of it being \u201cother worldly\u201d and it gave me an odd looming feeling. (It should be noted that I was and still am, completely sober.)  Anyhow, I started taking photos of this strange cloud and realized that I had it set on \u201csquare\u201d photo and then I switched it to \u201cregular\u201d photo after a few shots (just to explain the difference in layout).  My friend was ready to go and stroll Gay Street, so I turned around on my heels and hopped in the street (as I often do) to take more photos of Gay Street looking South towards the Tennessee Theatre and the river.  So I snap, snap, snap, etc. and then hop back on the sidewalk and take a couple more shots after that. During my photo blitz, I was more focused on looking through my phone-camera than I was on looking at the sky, so I didn\u2019t pick up the details that I had shot until I got home (about an hour and a half later).  As I flipped through the evening\u2019s shots, I could clearly see something in the sky of one of the shots and when zooming in, I discovered that I had photographed a Fleet of bright green UFO\u2019s!  Of course, I then took a much closer look at the photos before and after this particular shot and discovered that I had tracked this Fleet coming out of the clouds (near a mountain which is lined with radio towers) and seconds later, they were on the opposite side of the sky over the Tennessee River.  In the next to the last shot, you can see two domed lights on top of the mountain (across the river).  NOTE:   There are no lights on top of this mountain and the lights are not seen before or after the incident.  Then in the last shot, you will notice the same two dome lights lifting off into the sky and there is also an orb-type UFO faintly seen in this shot as well. The last shot was taken out of series at 9:14 pm. (I think I just happened to catch them again while they were \u201ctaking off\u201d).  None of my photos before or after this series of Gay Street shots, show anything in the sky, nor specs on the lens, etc.  I still have all these photos on my phone and I am happy to show anybody who would like to see the original shots so you can verify the time, date and that I have not retouched these in any way.  I have only emailed them to myself and saved them to my desktop to put a slide show together which I shared on my FaceBook page. I should also mention that I have had Close Encounters (of several kinds) numerous times throughout my life.  However, this is the first time that I have ever managed to take photographs of the visitors.  Not that it means much to those who don\u2019t know me but I\u2019m a very logical person, a respected professional in my industry (fine art painting) and a \u201cnormal\u201d 49 year old mother.  I hope these photos help open some minds on the topic. Also to note:  In one of the photos, the glowing green orb heads towards me and is photographed from about 10 feet from me near the sidewalk.  Also, when I zoomed in on these photos, each of the anomalies appear to have a 6 pointed star-like glow and each have a hue of violet/rose colored aura around them.",

You see, around 1989 my brother and I both saw a ufo. Basically, we were standing at the bottom of my cousin's driveway (In Knoxville, TN), waiting for the school bus.  It was always our waiting spot so we were standing there waiting for our cousin's to walk down the driveway.  It was your average morning when my brother and I just looked up and saw this ufo hovering just a few feet right above our heads.  It's an event I'll never forget because that night I dreamed the ufo shot rays down at my brother.   My memories are vague to two brain tumor surgeries I had a few years later but I asked my brother about it years later.  He said it was triangular shaped and had lights all around the bottom of it.  I know there was no noise whatsoever nor was there any wind.  It was just the huge, silent thing above our heads... In my excitement,I ran up the driveway to meet my cousin's shouting, \"Did you see that?\" The reply was,\"See what?\"  I turned around and walked back down the driveway to my brother where I asked him, \"Where did it go?\"  He simply said,\"It just flew away.\"And that was that. The reason I'm writing now is because I saw the show on the tv and they said there were several ufo sightings around 89, which was or was about the same year we saw it AND it was triangular shaped too.. We never really told anyone about it except for my cousins and family.  My parents never believed us and still don't.  My cousin believes me although she didn't see it.

      "story": "Large black rectangle, silent, two red rectangle lights on the rear, no other lights, very slowly circled my property,3 other witnesses Me and three other people were setting inside my single wide mobile home on my 11 acres of land.  We were talking when I heard a very soft (all most inaudible) hum.  Recently, tornadoes had gone through my county and I was quite weary of storms so I walked to my back door and opened it to check the weather.  There was no sound outside but a lot of cloud to cloud lightning in the distance.  I stood there a moment and noticed something moving above my tree line (A hundred yards or so away).  I couldn\u2019t see it very well at that moment just a black silhouette against the lightning in the back ground (no thunder).  It was shaped like a black domino, the size of a few football fields, floating silently, horizontally at the speed of an ultralight, perhaps even slower but much bigger, its altitude must have been as high as two or three fully grown pine trees.  The object was directly in front of me traveling from my left to my right.  One of my friends walked over to me and ! I asked them what they thought it was.  After a moment watching it we could see the rear of the object (I\u2019m assuming the rear since it was going away from us now) there were two red/orange lights like engines from a Star Wars movie, no glow just the color, like it was a red/orange sticker stuck to the rear (I don\u2019t know if they were engines though) they were the complete height of the object which I\u2019m guessing was about a two-story building.  As if you put your thumb in the center of a rectangle and to the left and right side of your thumb was red/orange light and where your thumb is it was black like the rest of the object.  My friend looked at me and we both agreed we never seen anything like that before (Warner robins air force base is about 30 minutes away so we see planes and the such all the time.)  We watched as it tilted 45 degrees like a plane banking left but it stayed on the same course it had been on.  We watched the back end of it (the engines) until it passed behin! d some trees (we could only make out the shape of the object with each flash of lightning in the distance of which there was an abundant amount).  Awe struck we walked back to the living room and started to explain to the two-other people hanging out what we just saw. I was ecstatic telling them how I\u2019ve never seen anything like that before. A few minutes later (less then five) while we are describing the object I heard the same vague hum. I asked if anyone else could hear the hum, they could not. Excited I ran to the back door but there was nothing there, disappointed I walked around to the front of my mobile home to take a look and to my surprise there it was, a giant black rectangle moving very slowly, about 5 acres away, across my field, above more tree lines. Coming from my left to my right again (as if it had circled my property while we were inside). It was very large, completely silent (I could only hear the hum both times inside the mobile home). The object was horizontal again and I could see the front since it was so far to my left. ! There were no lights of any kind on the front, bottom and side. I watched it slowly crossing my field. A few minutes passed and I realized the other three had come out side and they were watching it, not saying a word. The object made a slow turn to the right (never banking) as if it was following a giant half circle. Realizing I was not alone and others were witnessing the same thing I began jumping up and down screaming \u201cWhat the expletive is that? What is that? Do yall Expletive see that\u201d No one said a word. We watched it for a few more minutes until it was going away from us and disappeared over another tree line, in the direction of Warner Robins Air-force Base that\u2019s when we could see the rear and there were the red/orange engines again. It never made a sound and moved way to slowly to be able to stay in the air for its rectangular shape and size. Perhaps it was some weird blimp I\u2019ve never seen before. The next day my friend that saw it the first time with me refused ! to talk about it saying over and over it was just a C-130, tho! ugh it m oved way to slow and C-130\u2019s are super loud that close. The other two swore it was an alien craft (One friend, my future wife, claimed to be very frightened during the whole ordeal) which made me laugh (though it could have been, not doubting that possibility). I didn\u2019t even think about aliens, I was thinking it was some piece of technology the U.S government had that we have not been told about yet, something similar to how people thought the stealth bomber years ago was an alien craft. I never felt endangered the entire time.  I just find it so odd that a day or two later my friend (that saw it with me first) was so reluctant to talk about the experience saying it was just a C-130 even though all the rest of that night he was flabbergasted as the rest of us.  That was in 2009, at the time of me writing this it is 2018 and I have never seen the object again. I apologize for the description being so lengthy.

I\u2019m always looking up at the sky, and tonight I see this thing that looks like a star, but it\u2019s blinking, on and off.  It\u2019s not moving like an airplane. But it did move.  I went inside to get my camera and when I came back out I couldn\u2019t find it.  My son spotted it.  It had move higher up, but it still was not moving like an airplane would do.  And it was still blinking, on and off.  Flashing.  Blink. Blink. Blink. And it\u2019s not like the twinkling of a star.  This was brighter, and a more pronounced flash, with a pause between the flashes. We went in around 20 minutes after 9 and it was still up there flashing at that time.

      "story": "Four triangular craft seen stationary in the sky over South Knoxville, TN Disclosure begins with me, right?  Here\u2019s what happened:  It was a little before 6:00 PM on June 08, 2016.  I was leaving the Chapman Highway Big Lots in South Knoxville, TN.  As I recall, the parking lot was nearly empty.  I was alone.  It was sunny.  As I approached my car, I saw four white, triangular craft stationary in the sky to my right.  They were identical.  They seemed equally spaced as if in formation. I would estimate the encounter was between five and ten seconds.  I had enough time to notice the craft, process that they weren\u2019t normal, retrieve my phone, access the camera, and take two pictures.  Yes, this story is corroborated with pictures. I cannot speak to how the craft moved.  I was distracted by my cell phone.  I heard nothing.  The encounter was silent.  They disappeared as suddenly as they appeared.  In the photos, the craft are definitely on the move.  They went from 0-gone almost instantly.",

      "story": "I was just sitting on my front porch smoking a cigarrette when I looked at the sky as I normally do and I noticed that there was a very bright blue colored star that I had never seen before.  The more I watched, i noticed that it was moving, but very little.  It's altitude stayed pretty much the same but it was bouncing from side to side as if to steady.  The blue light is not star blue, rather, it appears LED.  But it is only blue, a perfect circle of blue emitted light.  For the past hour it has changed altitude and position slightly, but still in relative proximity.  My wife came out to watch and noticed yet another light within a couple of miles of the other.  Focusing in with a camera reveals that the light is luminated by what appear to be hundreds of small lights of different colors, yet primarily blue.  I have see an oval and one cone in my lifetime.  They were both hauling some serious ass.  These ones un-nerve me, because they are so stationary, in what seems a strategic distance apart.   If i could elevate myself in my current position, I fear that I would see more of them in a line.  This has been going on for an hour now, and they have yet to break position.  Pictures are unfortunately on my camera because my phone will not zoom in to that altitude..  Which says A LOT because six days ago I was able to zoom in on the FEMA cargo carrier that landed at McGee Tyson, and be able to identify it from 15,000 feet.",

They weren\u2019t moving crazy fast but I didn\u2019t hear any sound or see any lights flashing like a normal airplane. It looked exactly like a bunch of satellites in a row going across the sky. They seemed to be fairly high in altitude. This looked like a possible military exercise although that would be strange due to the number of craft and lack of major military base near Knoxville.",
