      "story": "Flashing from a possible satellite tumbling on its arc. Took my dog out for his last night potty run about 10:45 pm tonight.  I always look up at the stars at night as it was something Dad and I used to do when I was growing up.  He was an engineer, designing early communication satellites, and I know quite a few of his designs are above us, circling the Earth.  Dad taught me how to identify a planet as opposed to a star, and how to track the satellites when they go overhead. Tonight, I caught a glimpse of a flash of white light out of the corner of my eye traveling from the west to the east/southeast sky above the star Altair (used my Sky Guide app to figure its location), then dismissed it as I thought it was a light of an airplane high overhead.  We are under the flight lines for our local airport and the nearby military base.  I looked to the south and then back over where I saw the light and saw a smaller glimmer of it.  Continued watching that area of the sky and it flashed again and again, somewhat in a predictive sequence about 2-3 seconds in between each flash and the duration of the flash was a fraction of a second which made it very hard to predict where it was going.  When it flashed again, this time it was like a streamer flying in the wind with a 1-2 second duration and then it disappeared, only to quickly flash again a few more times before the light dimmed out of sight. I do not believe it is a UFO craft.  I believe I saw a satellite which may have been knocked so it's spinning while in orbit and caught the sun reflecting off its solar panels (the flashing light) instead of a steady glow which moves in an arc across the night sky.  The flashing light was still traveling as if it were following a satellite arc, that's how I could guess where to look when I realized it wasn't an airplane flying overhead.    Just wondered if anyone else had seen the same thing tonight.  Pretty interesting!",

      "story": "Shapeshifting, yellow ufo seen in broad daylight over elementary and high school in Georgia. On Monday morning at 7:20 am, I dropped off my child to school.  I then left school, in my car, heading  towards home. At 7:40 am, while driving, l saw a yellow/light beige/dimmed white, wide V sign/open triangle v, with the point pointed towards me.  It changed shape from a wide V / open triangle, to 2 wide open V triangles, V /\\ turning from an open V triangle, to a closed overlapping square &lt;&gt; continuing to change shape from a overlapping \u201csquare\u201d to a closed diamond \\//\\&lt;&gt;. The UFO was in constant movement/ shifting shapes not radiating light, dimmed yellow in appearance. It was higher than full grown pinetrees that were in sight next to the ufo, on the right side (trees approximately 8 feet high). It was whatsoever not right next to the trees, but far away, high in the sky. It was a pretty blue sky day and the uap was approximately 1 mile visible to an Elementary School. I was driving while this was happening and only was able to capture about 2 seconds of the ufo on my cellphone video, where you can see a yellow spot behind pine trees, before it disappeared.  Not flying away or zooming away, but here one second gone the next.  It seemed more like a clocking, then disappearing. When I returned home, I had tried to reach out for someone to \u201cinvestigate\u201d, since it had been sooo close to an elementary and high school, but without success. Eventually I called 911 to report a ufo anonymous, but I am not aware of any additional sightings from others. During this sighting there were many cars behind me and the street was in open view to many others, at this busy Monday morning, school day. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  PD))",

It was black on dark you could see the shape but see no detail, as we made the trip this thing paced our speed and direction from 50 mph to 75 and once we stopped to see what it would do... it stopped we shut the car off and watched for a moment, it just remained there waiting, well we had to pick up a car and there really was nothing we could do about\"it\" so on we went, as we pulled into the repair shops lot the craft when overhead and headed in the direction of Scott AFB.The craft was large maybe 200' on all sides, it's flight was around 500'up and it did not make a sound.

      "story": "Two bright star like objects swooping down then hugging tree line.... January 2007, Fayetteville NC  It was around 7:00pm. I was heading west to my parents house on Cliffdale Rd. I saw these two bright lights coming out of the clouds (storm clouds just hit the area.(no rain tho) The clouds were mid altitude to low, running fast west. Now at first I thought they were helicopters, because my parents live right next to Fort Bragg. And it\u2019s totally normal to see them in the area. Now what caught my attention was the light as they came out of the clouds (it was kinda dark all around), I thought dam that\u2019s cool to be flying and doing that(coming out of a storm like that). I saw them and lost them as I drove. They came out of the clouds and started to head down. Now when I turned into my parents housing area, as I was going down the road and I saw the lights again behind the houses (not right behind the houses) but I could see where they were still moving west and heading down. I pulled into my parents house and ran to the back yard. The lights were bright, very bright. Both the lights seem to be independent from each other but kept a tight formation. One light was a head of the other. As I watch them, they swooped down and started hugging the tree line real close, I mean right down in the tree line. I could see the lights thru the trees, its January and the trees had relatively no leaves on them. They where constantly changing altitude, up, up, up, down, up, down up..etc... Very quick tho. I had a clear line of sight on them, before hugging the tree line. The description of the light was as follow: bright white (dead center) to white/yellowish around its edges. The light was not glowing perfectly around the object but had spikes of lights around it but north, east and west the spikes of light where at there greatest, with a long tail down (kind of like in Christmas cards, how they draw the star of Bethlehem) The tail down was really weird, it sparkled half way down the tail, slightly wavy and sparkling. As I sat there watching them, I really could not focus on them because it was all light. But I did squint m! y eyes a nd I saw a hint of blue and yellow blinking light (only one time) coming from dead center of the object. They got closer and closer down into the tree line and keep moving west right into Fort Bragg. Now I thought of every thing that it could have been. I am a military brat, seen all types of aircraft daytime and nighttime. No way was it a helicopter. If it was they are very irresponsible for flying that low in that kind of weather. Also it moved up and down so fast and tight when hugging the tree line. The other thing that I thought it could be is a flare canister with a parachute that larger military aircraft release. But the wind was strong and they would of flow apart unless they were tied together, if so I didn\u2019t see the chute, which I think I should have been seen easily with that large of a light source. And the light was so large that I think that the chute would have caught on fire. Also when they came out of the sky the were coming down at a constant rate and smoothly straighten out before hugging the tree line. The wind was to my back going west but I tried to see if I heard anything but the wind on my ears made that impossible. The light source is what made me think. If it was any type of aircraft the light source completely envelop the whole aircraft. Never seen anything like that. I looked all over the internet and read this whole website trying to validate what I saw. The only thing that I keep reading is that people see a star like object, but I wish people be a bit more detail....thus me writing a lot...PS When I say they flew into Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg is a big base, I don\u2019t mean the main base were the housing area is and the PX/BX, mini mall is at. But there is a large area west of bragg that\u2019s all impact area and they have drop zones there, field exercise area, etc., also I will be sending you a map as soon as i can get it done.

It had a smaller blue light at the very end of it  - I would say both lights were more at the tips of the craft rather than on the underside of it. I also noticed vertical grooves (evenly spaced) on it as it neared the other side of the highway before disappearing over the trees. I am assuming it is cigar-shaped but from the angle I saw it at - although, it could have been saucer shaped. It made absolutely no sound whatsoever. I drove a little ways down to get a better view where there weren\u2019t any trees. I could see all the way to the horizon. There was nothing there. It made no sense. I have traveled this road on many occasions and I am used to seeing planes fly overhead and I always like to look at them as they fly off into the distance. I couldn\u2019t even see any lights or anything at all out there. It was as if it never happened.  Overall, I\u2019d say I saw the craft for about 10 - 15 seconds, if that.

      "story": "White ball with alternating colored orbs, hovering/moving above tree level in urban Arkansas neighborhood. I was walking my dog, when I noticed a weird white light over across the big field from where I live, just hovering. So I immediately thought there must've been a new light installed on a phone tower or something in that area. Only this white light had two smaller lights, one red, one blue, rotating around it in a circle, alternating lights. I just began to think nothing of it, and started back inside, but my dog pulled me back the other way, and as I looked back up to where it was, it had moved towards my direction, and was still moving. At this point, I thought well maybe it's plane, but that didn't explain why it was hovering before, nor did it explain the red and blue white spinning around it. So I watched it for a couple more minutes as it came towards me, and then is stopped. It stopped again in mid-air, and hovered for maybe 30 seconds, and then started moving again, only this time heading East, the whole time with the red and blue lights spinning around it. I watched it until it was out of my line of vision behind other houses and trees.  This \"craft\" emitted absolutely no sound whatsoever. I've seen planes and helicopters around here. The planes are NEVER this low to the ground, and you always hear them. Same goes for helicopters. I'm in a valley, you'd hear anything up there. This thing was maybe 50 feet up, and made absolutely no sound whatsoever.",

It was shortly after sundown with some lingering clouds that were illuminated brightly because of the bright moon.  Looking distantly towards the north/northwest I saw an object with a reddish glow move from the east to the west.  The light did not blink, so my first thought was that the object was the space station flying overhead.  It had been a few years since I've seen the space station overhead, so I was excited to see it again.  But then I realized that the trajectory was not they typical pattern the space station orbits over the earth.  As I began to realize that this object was possibly not the space station, another object with a flashing light akin to an aircraft or fighter jet began to follow the first object.  It sped up as if it were trying to catch up to it and then when it got to a certain distance from the first object, it locked in the same speed and maintained its course and distance with the first object.  I watched for a few more seconds before I lost view of both objects behind the clouds.  This could have occurred either over Fort Bragg or Pope AFB or just to the north of these military installations.  I am located about 2 miles south of the Reilly gate of Fort Bragg. No noises were heard and no definitive shapes could be identified. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "UFO observed in front of the Moon during FULL Lunar Eclipse 20 February 2008 in Fayetteville, NC Approximately 22:40 EST, 20 February 2008, at XXXX ((deleted)) Drive, Fayetteville, NC 28311, I was observing the lunar eclipse that began about 22:30 EST. From my position in North Carolina, the moon was in full lunar eclipse; weather was ideal- \"clear blue and 22\" as we say in aviation; the moon was approximately 55 degrees South/ Southwest overhead- in other words, I had a clear unobstructed view of the lunar eclipse from my position on my front porch in Fayetteville, NC. I normally wouldn't be looking at the moon except this Lunar Eclipse event had been widely publicized on TV that evening. I was enjoying an event with unobstructed view that few will ever witness in their life time. Approximately 10 minutes into the full lunar eclipse, about 22:40 EST, I noticed on the left side of the moon (as I was facing it), a very bright, round object resembling a satellite; a bright pin-point of light object; clearly not a naturally formed object appeared suddenly, traveling in a straight line from the left side of the back side of the moon- it was clearly traveling in a straight line towards Earth. In about one to two seconds, the object made a 90 degree turn to my right, directly in front of the face of the fully eclipsed moon.  As quick as it appeared and shot across in front of my unobstructed view of the eclipsed moon, it disappeared off to my right side of the Moon and became invisible almost immediately of passing out of the Umbra shadow of the Earth eclipse of the Moon.  The entire event was less than 5 seconds. I am a US Army trained combat helicopter pilot, Desert Storm veteran of the Gulf War.  I'm accustomed and trained to look for things, especially at night.  This was not a naturally occurring object. This object made intelligent turns and in relation to the position of the moon, was traveling at as fantastic rate of speed. I am not a UFO nut.  You may even call me skeptical.  I have been able to observe a great deal of objects while flying with night vision goggles at night in various parts of the world.  I have witnessed many naturally occurring and man-made events in the sky normally not seen with the naked eye.  But this object appeared from the back-side of the moon with my un-aided view and flew directly across in front of the moon was of intelligent design and flight path.  It probably would not have been visible during the lighted or visible, not eclipsed, moon, by an un-aided human eye.  But during the eclipsed darkened view of the Moon, it was so clearly visible to the naked human eye!   I truly believe the object I observed was not of natural origin but of intelligent origin.  I am capable of distinguishing the difference between a circular type orbit versus a straight flight path.  This object was of the latter. And I know of no known human-made objects that could have produced such incredible speeds and turns based upon its observed position that night from the back side of the moon, making an instant 90 degree right turn in front and across the eclipsed moon that night. By the way, I was 47 years old at the time of the lunar eclipse and my eye sight has been evaluated as 20/12 & 20/15 in each eye during every one of my US Army Flight Physical Evaluations for the past 20 years.   I honestly believe I witnessed an intelligently driven object not of man-made origin.  I have reluctantly not reported this event to anyone before now because it was so incredible to believe myself.  And I do not want to be labeled a \"UFO Nut\".  But I witnessed, regardless of scrutiny, a truly incredible event that evening on 20 February 2008 during the Lunar Eclipse.",

      "story": "Anomalous aircraft seen over Fayetteville N.C. citizen. Hello Reader,  Hello, I am 29 years old and my name is not important.   I am a father.  I am ex-military.   I run a small business here in Fayetteville N.C.  I have never been a real UFO enthusiast or anything but have always been a very open minded thinker.  So the other day I got a phone call from my mom telling me to contact my sister ASAP.  My sister lives in Marshalltown Iowa 1,100 miles away.  She also has to pay for outgoing long distance calls so normally we talk when I call her.   As soon as I dialed and said hello she says, very enthusiastically, \u201cbrother you\u2019re not going to believe what I saw today!\u201d   What was it?  I asked.   She proceeded to tell me how she was driving downtown towards the post office when she noticed an extremely bright object in the sky that appeared to be a floating star.  She described the object as being at least two stories high and definitely within the city limits.   She told me that she had no idea what it was but that she stopped and got out of her vehicle to get a better look.  When she got out looking towards the sky, she said the object was gone.   I thought about this for a moment and asked her what she thought she saw.  She said she had no idea but that it didn\u2019t make sense the object had vanished so quickly.  I tried to offer her a reasonable explanation by telling her that it\u2019s possible for sunlight to reflect off an aircraft very brightly and seemingly disappear when the aircraft changes direction slightly in the sky.   She was not totally satisfied with this and responded by telling me that the aircraft would have been flying too low.  When the conversation was over she seemed calmed down some.  I should mention that to her credit my sister is a very intelligent and grounded person.  Not one to make up such stories.  I believed she saw something.  The next day I had pretty much forgotten all about the phone call with my sister.  My business associate and I had just finished services at one of our customer\u2019s property.  This was on Vista dr.  We both got into the truck and as I was starting the ignition I looked up.  Immediately I was struck by what I saw. The aircraft was big.  I\u2019m estimating it to be about the size of a Boeing 747 passenger jet.  It was shaped almost like a blimp, \u201cand this was the first thought that came to my mind\u201d, but longer giving it an even more aerodynamic look.  It was very luminescent.  I could not make out any distinguishable shapes like you would expect to see on an aircraft besides the color.  The color had the appearance of mercury and I could also see some red towards the front upper portion. No tail, no undercarriage, no wings.   My mind was racing like lightning.  After about 3 seconds I yelled to my partner, \u201cLOOK!\u201d  And I pointed skyward.  She looked up, but not quick enough.  The craft, which was traveling at about 60 mph, had entered into the tree line overhead.  She looked back at me and I was still looking upward.  I saw it for about 2 more seconds through the trees and then disappeared back over the tree line.  I was AMPED!  I hit the gas and we began speeding through the neighborhood.  I was definitely getting another look at this thing!  I turned a sharp right at the corner and tore down the road.  We went about 7 blocks.  All the while I was looking madly up at the sky trying to see around the trees and get a better look.  It took me about 30 seconds to get to a better area.  I pulled into a parking lot and got out of the truck.  From this position I had a good 360 degree view.  It was a mostly clear sky and I could see for miles in the direction that the aircraft should have been headed.  Even then I expected to see something that made sense.  It must have been some kind of blimp or something.  There was nothing.  I was completely astounded.  Why didn\u2019t I see something in the sky?  What the hell did I see?  It shouldn\u2019t have been possible at the speed it was traveling to elude my range of vision when I could now easily see for miles.  This all happened at about 1: pm Oct, 21, 2008. At this point my partner was looking at me like I had gone bat shit.  So I gave her the phone and made her call the airport.  At this time I spoke to Trisha in the radar tower.  I asked her if any aircraft were currently flying above the downtown area.  She asked me what I had seen and I said that I wasn\u2019t sure maybe a blimp.  She told me to hold on and then came back on the phone.  She told me that I had probably seen one of the many military aircraft that fly over Fayetteville.  I told her, \u201cNo Trisha, I want to know if you have any communication right now with any aircraft over the downtown area and if so, what specifically?\u201d  She said that a C-130 had been flying over the downtown area.  I told her that,\u201d no it was not a C-130.\u201d  I used to jump out of this type of aircraft when I served in the military.  It is very easy for me to identify.  I should also note that I have lived in Fayetteville for 7 years now.  Being local for so long, and near Pope air force base, I am very used to looking up in the sky and seeing military aircraft.  You see everything from warthogs and C-130s to Chinook helicopters, to name a few.  Also, I live less than I mile from the air force base and have seen many different types of military aircraft, in the sky, on routine training flights.  After I spoke with Trisha in the radar tower I was both very excited and very confused.  I thought for sure that they would have some sort of explanation that made sense.  No, they had nothing.  Later that afternoon I called the police station and spoke with a dispatcher.  She had no other reports of anomalous objects in the sky.  I\u2019m not sure if she made a report of my story or not but I told her everything.  I also called the airport back and spoke to Trisha again.  No one else had called in at all.  She gave me a number to Pope AFB.  I called and left a message to call me back please.  No one has called.  That was 48 hrs ago.  I have no easy explanation for what I experienced.  The events surrounding this seem just extraordinary, for example; my sister calling the day before.  Interestingly enough the presidential nominee Barrack Obama was here last weekend.  McCain is coming this weekend.  Do these things relate?  I can only speculate about that as I try to make some sense of things.  Another wild coincidence is that Great Britain just released a 1,500-page batch of top secret documents that were UFO related. http://news.aol.com/article/britain-releases-more-ufo-sighting-files/217434?icid=200100397x1211165486x1200734593   Although I\u2019m not sure exactly what I saw I can tell you this.  Visibly it seemed immediate that it was anomalous.  It should have been in the sky longer.  The radar tower should have known what it was.  Many other people should have seen this as it was almost directly above downtown Fayetteville.   My sister believes she also saw something anomalous in the sky 24 hours prior to my experience.  Somehow this is all absolutely PHENOMENAL.",

They seemed to float and we strikingly shinny/bright against the black storm cloud of the approaching storm. There were three game delays and it was announched that the storms were severe containing hail and high winds. I thought the weather service may have been releasing weather ballons into the sky. The floated in succession at close intervals and each one took about 2-3 minutes to be sucked up into the storm. There were at least eight of these that we saw. The game still had 25,000 people at is so many more had to notice this event.",

      "story": "Star-like object(s) make unusual manuevers in the night sky. 07/23/2011  The events I am about to describe are absolutely true and were witnessed multiple times by myself and 1-2 other individuals at the same time.  These events were witnessed during the years of 2001-2002 and again in 2008-2009.  Under no circumstances were the individuals involved under the influence of any substance.  The following sightings were observed by multiple individuals without the influence of suggestion, or \"wishful thinking.\"  Each of these incidents was exactly alike in nature. At the time of my first sighting I was in my mid to late teens.  It was sometime in the summer months at around 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight, as me and a friend of mine were awaiting his car ride home.  We had been waiting outside in the drive way under what was a perfectly clear night sky, for about forty-five minutes to an hour when something caught my eye. I have always been a bit of a \u201cstar gazer\u201d, that is, I enjoy the beauty and awe of a well star-lit night.  So naturally, my eyes are often glancing to the stars, but this particular night I noticed what appeared to be a star in motion.  The object, from my point of view, appeared no different than the stars in the night sky: it twinkled exactly like a star and was the same size of a star from a ground-level perspective. Using my best judgments, the object seemed to be at a very high altitude- almost right outside of the earth\u2019s atmosphere.  It was moving on a steady path at what would have been a high rate of speed in regards to how high it seemed to be traveling- much like how a plane seems to be moving slow when viewed from ground, but its actual speed is about 400 mph. I watched this strange object make its way across the sky with such curiosity and confusion in my mind regarding its identity.   During this point in my observation, I didn\u2019t direct my friend\u2019s attention to it because it was happening relatively fast and I was trying to process what exactly was going on.  It traveled this path for about 20 seconds from the time I noticed it until it did something that made my heart sink into my stomach. The object suddenly came to a complete and abrupt stop in mid-air, made a wide-angle turn at what looked like 4x its original speed, shot across the sky at an even higher rate of speed (without the characteristic \u201ctail\u201d associated with shooting stars) into the direction from which it came, and literally vanished into the night sky. In response to this, I naturally started screaming in disbelief at what I had just seen.  My friend laughed and attempted to offer suggestions as to what it could have been (a plane, satellite, comet, etc.) but I knew better.  In an attempt to explain what I had seen to my friend, I pointed to the sky and used my finger to describe the path the object had taken.  Within minutes I noticed the same object a second time, taking a similar path as the first sighting.  This time both me and my friend were observing the object repeat this similar course of travel, redirection and departure.  Needless to say, we were both baffled and I had gained another reason to watch the skies. Several years later on a similar summer night, I was standing outside in my father\u2019s backyard beside a small bonfire talking with my brother and father.  Looking toward the stars, I noticed the same object making its course across the sky.  This time I made no hesitation to direct my company\u2019s attention to the object.  Once again, the strange oddity followed the exact same course flight, redirection and departure.  All of us who were present saw the same events at the same time. I have no knowledge of any natural phenomenon that could occur as I have described.  There is no technology that I am aware of that could perform the way this object did.  I have no desire to create such stories for attention or for personal thrills.  I am in no way assuming that this/these object(s) are of any particular origin, be it human or \u201cextra-terrestrial\u201d- I simply do not have enough evidence or knowledge of the subjects to support either theory.  The only facts that I can absolutely be certain of are: 1) the events occurred exactly as described above; and 2) the object does exist.

He pointed up above the trees across the road at a blue, chandeleir crystal shaped object.  It seemed to be spinning flashing bright, sparkly light all around it.   Then he pointed ubove the house and there, posted like centurions was four, rectangular with triangle tops, like a childs drawing of a house.  Each of these objects were all of different colors but yet you could see through them.  Then in the middle of the road was a bright gold light.  May have been mars?   Also to the south was another bright blue sparkly thing but it wasnt as big as the other blue object.   I woke my daughter and her husband to come see.  We noticed some neighbors in pajamas looking too. There was a police cruiser who drove by right under the biggest, blue object.  He drove very slowly and he had his headlights off.   After a couple of hours I went into bed, with them still out there and watched through the window as the porchlight pulsed, as if power surges and then dimmer.  I called my mom, I then called the police but rreported anonymously.  I dont think they took me seriously.   Before I went into bed we noticed a flat, black aircraft with a bright flashing red light on top racing around the sky very quickly under these objects as if to warn them that they had been noticed by our militery?   Also, planes began arriving from the east about every three minutes.   When we got up the next morning the sky was divided into perfect pie wedges made with com trails. as if to mark each objects location.  Some very odd things happened after we all got to bed. I will discuss that part, privately with an investigator if you like. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))",

The lights appeared to be flying from south to north in Fayetteville, Arkansas, along interstate 540, in triangular like formations.   3 or 4 lights seemed too turn west along Wedington road.  At least 2 other lights disappeared from sight completely in an unknown direction, the rest of the lights continued north over interstate 540. The lights appeared to be under 10,000 feet (3,030.3 meters) and moving quite fast but at varying speeds.  I witnessed what seemed to be 1 light dropping altitude, speeding  up and  passing another light in the same formation.  The light that was passed  then broke sharp to the west and a few other lights  behind it followed along the same route west over wedington road. I can say with 100% assuredness that in my 6 yrs Launching rockets as a MLRS crew member in the US army national guard, and my time in Iraq watching night time take offs and bombing raids by US jets, multiple helicopter formation  at night, and UAV flights, that it was nothing like anything I have ever seen while being in  the military.   I am also an avid stargazer and satellite watcher.  Saturn was almost right over head (maybe 80 degrees above the horizon) and most of the lights seemd to be at least 3 to 4 times as bright as Saturn.

      "story": "Black walnut shaped craft observed in broad daylight floating across sky with no sound It was after work on a week day, I stepped out into the backyard to enjoy the nice weather while I was talking on the phone with my grandmother-in-law. I had sat down in my lawn chair facing North and while talking on phone I noticed out of the corner of my left eye, which would have been to the West, what appeared at first to be a bird that was gliding. The wind was blowing out of the North and it was like when a bird faces into the wind and is able to just hold its wings out and kind of stay in one spot while riding the current of the wind. After about 30 seconds of noticing the object I realized that this thing was moving slowly but with no movement (wings flapping).  I looked over at object and to my big surprise it was not a bird but only what I could describe as a solid black walnut shape. It seemed to be so close, but is hard to say how far away from me it was.   I dropped the phone in amazement, not caring about the phone call no longer, knowing I wo! uld never witness this again. In fact, it was the weirdest feeling because my brain would not register what I was looking at. I watched this object fly into the Northeast direction, with absolutely no sound associated with the craft at all, until it dissappeared into the clouds. It stayed at the same speed the entire time of the observation, and since it moved across my vision from southwest to northeast, there were plenty of angles to tell that in did not have any wings.  I still to this day can not believe and will never forget this expereince, since it happened in broad daylight! I have seen plenty of odd acting lights in the sky over the years, knowing they were not of anything mankind has produced...at least publicly. From what I think the distance was from my position on the ground, the craft must have been around 25 to 50 feet in diameter.

      "story": "Unidentified 'barbell-shaped vessel' cruises over dark country road. On the evening of july 29th, 2013 at approximately 9:45p.m. while driving home on a lonely dark country road I saw what appeared to be a set of stadium lights rising above the trees in a wooded area about 1/4th of a mile off the road. I was briefly perplexed thinking \"I didn't know there was a ball field out here.\"  Being that I was on a hill I had a fairly good view. As I proceeded down the hill I decided to pull over to get a better look.  I turned my truck off (it is a 5-speed and difficult to simply idle)and was struck by the deafening silence that surrounded me.  What had happened to the nightly frog and cricket orchestra that graced our country summers?  The two lights suddenly appeared to be so much closer (even though up until this point I had not seen them move).  They slowly advanced towards the road and within what seemed like a second were directly in front of me just a little above the tree line.  I said out loud \"oh my god, oh my god&q! uot;.  It was now evident that the two lights were connected by a long, dark 'body' which donned a row of small airplane-like lights of varying colors (red, blue, green).  The shape resembled a barbell with the lights being the weights.  It was about the size of a commercial airplane.  To be so humongous it was amazing that I heard NOTHING!  And the lights were so bright however my vision was unaffected. The vessel disappeared from my visual field once its entirety had crossed the road.  I pulled away and looking in my rear view mirror saw no further traces of the vessel.",

I work around them everyday. While traveling down I-95 about 15 miles outside of Lumberton NC,  My passenger and I witnessed a long formation of white lights above horizon. Jokingly, we talked about an aircraft landing on the highway.   As we drew closer, the line of lights made me certain that these were no landing lights of any aircraft I have encountered.  As we traveled ever closer the lights formed into somewhat of a cross/disc shape with a bright light in each corner.  A single unflashing red light accompanied the center light.  The craft was angelic in its movements and seemed to hover at a speed at which no aircraft could maintain flight.  I would estimate its altitude at 200 feet.  I could make out the feint curvature of a hull between the lights. No sound was heard when I rolled down my windows.  At this point my passenger and I couldn't comprehend what we had just seen.  The craft passed over to the trees on the right of the interstate. I knew i needed to photograph the craft so I immediately took the exit a quarter mile from our sighting, but the craft was nowhere to be seen.  I know there were other witnesses.   I consider myself an extremely logical person but have no explanation for what was seen.  It maneuvered in a manner no earthly vessel can. The fact I witnessed this on the supposed end of the world might bring discredit to my story, but I know what I saw.

I was taking some shopping bags out of my car trunk at the apartment complex where I live (near the University of Arkansas campus) when I noticed moving lights at the edge of my vision.  I was closing the trunk lid when I sighted the group of 3 orange/yellow lights/orbs moving overhead from my right to my left.  The orbs displayed a bright nucleus of light surrounded by a softer glowing aura of a paler shade.  The orbs were arrayed in a loose single file pattern moving overhead from the south toward the north at an altitude one generally see's a single engine prop plane fly at.  If one held a pencil eraser at arm's length and noted it's perceived diameter the orbs would have been of a like diameter.  The light emitted by each orb was consistent and didn't flicker and was surrounded by a translucent aura as mentioned previously.  There was no noticeable sound coming from the orbs and the night sky was mostly clear with only a few diffuse clouds overhead.  The orbs were moving along at a brisk and steady pace.  When the orbs finally passed by me I could see that each had what appeared to be a pair of \u201cafterburner\u201d like lights/emissions trailing behind them as they moved toward the northern horizon.  The 3 orbs finally disappeared from my view.  Then I again looked  toward the southern sky and was surprised to see a group of 5 more orange/yellow orbs coming towards my position headed along a similar flight path.  4 of the orbs were grouped in a broad non-linear cluster but the 5th orb was much higher in altitude periodically obscured by some wispy clouds underneath it.  As the group of 5 orbs passed by me they too displayed what appeared to be rear mounted jet-like afterburners in their wake.   All 5 orbs disappeared shortly into the northern sky.  This group of orbs made no sounds as they passed into the distance.    As a side note I was fortunate to attend a lecture by Dr. J. Allen Hynek (Project Bluebook) in the early 70's and e! ven spoke to him briefly.  I found his presentation both fasci! nating a nd thought provoking.  I'm cautiously skeptical regarding unidentified lights and this is my first time seeing an odd aerial display of this nature.   I've witnessed a couple of Chinese lantern launches in person and these lighted orbs were unlike the lanterns I saw on those occasions.   These orbs were quite a sight to behold.",

On 14 Sep, 2013, at 2245, I observed a total of five bright lights moving across the sky. Initially there was one light observed moving E to W approximately 70 degrees above the northern horizon.  The brightness of the light was between my observations of the ISS and Venus.  There was no sound or any additional lights one would expect from a passing aircraft. As I was taking video of this object with my IPhone, a friend who was also observing this lighted object said toward the eastern horizon there were four more moving in the same direction and the same speed.  They also came across the sky at the same elevation as the first and the final two were closer together, only 3-5 degrees apart.  I also recorded these objects on my IPhone. The brightness of the objects maintained their intensity as they passed by but slowly became dimmer as they continued to the West until they could no longer be viewed.  It was almost as if they were satellites reflecting the light of the sun, but that would have required a significant altitude based on the sun setting nearly 2 1/2 hours before the sighting. I flew in the Air Force for 21 years and with a commercial carrier for 15 years and can say I've never seen anything similar to this observation of these objects.  I consulted with a member of the FAA TRACON in the area and after pulling the radar history for the period of observation, he could find no activity to resemble the IPhone video he viewed.. I am at a loss as to what I saw and wanted to pass this information along to see if anyone else observed something similar on the noted day and time..",

The first aircraft or orb maintained a steady altitude, then began to spiral downward.  The color of the orb was bluish white.  The orb had a tail when it spiraled, however, when it maintained a steady altitude the light emitting from the orb possessed a sphere shape.   The second aircraft seemed to be flying near the orb almost as if the aircraft was observing the orb like object.   The object did not seem to be a flare due to the movement and acceleration.",

A friend and I had walked up a hill admiring the stars and at the top we paused.   We both noticed a gliding curve with a chevron shape at the center.  The flying object was small but wide and looked as if it was a mere line. (at first I suspected it was a flock of birds in V formation).   As I watched it float above it made absolutely no noise and appeared to be very low in the sky.   For 10 seconds or so my friend and I watched and discussed the possibilities of either birds flying south or a plane of some sort.  It couldn't have been birds because they weren't in a V formation and never once broke synchronization.   I also don't believe it was a plane because a anything flying that low and that slow would have to produce some sound.",

      "story": "Several Large UFO sightings over Bladen County, N.C. between 30 Dec 2016 and April 2017. It had been the fifth time this type of UFO has come to our area, which is our back yard.  The difference has been its size and distance to My home.  Every appearance, has drawn it closer and larger than the last one.  The first sighting was on 30 December 2016 @ 2300 hours.  It appeared and traveled down the street and above My neighbor's house across the street, then it came over mine.  It was so close I could have hit it with a baseball easily.  The neighbor in questioned moved from the fear of the incident.  This first one was saucer shape, reddish/orange, pulsating as it revolted, silently, eventually speeding incredibly fast over head and east off of Hwy 87.   The next two were on 26 January and 8 February, 2017.  These two were very similar in size, though larger than the first on 30 December 2016.  The one on 26 January 2017 appeared at 2145 hours, with three major reddish/orange lights equal distant apart, with a diamond like object trailing it behind and below the craft.  It diamond shape figure eventually joint the major part of the craft from underneath, then flow away as it traverse the trees at a distance.  The next one, on 8 February was huge, yet silent as well.  It didn't create no sound or disturbance of the atmosphere.  It remained steady state for approximately 45 minutes, if not more, because I was lost in its beauty.  This one too hard the three reddish/orange glow of lights, equally distant from each other and a trailing diamond shaped object.  The only difference with this observation was that the craft was larger than the last and the diamond shaped object moved more distal from the main object and freely over the neighboring homes and streets and tree lines.  The observation was the 11 April 2017, and without a doubt, the largest ever observed, and not just by Me, but by My entire family.  I've waited a long time to be vindicated by this current sighting, because all the others were seen by Me and when reported to My family, it was received rather unappreciated.  Then this sighting! occurre d and I was vindicated.  Like I said this one was the largest of them all, were every detail could be observed by everyone.  It too had the three reddish/orange lights equally distant, the bottom base could be seen perfectly, which demonstrated were the diamond shaped craft would descend from and the full range of what else there was underneath the UFO.  The bottom part, as I said, had the diamond shaped craft, along with what appeared to be a silvery bracket holding it in place, with some lighting as well.  You could see the way the edges of the UFO curved upward, all the way around.  The top seemed like a shimmering light blue glow about it. Once again, it was silent, and I expected some sound, considering the size of this UFO. The size, without question, had two be 3 and half times the size of My house, because as it traveled over it. It had extend equally on both ends, which would make it over 3 times 76 feet in diameter, since My home is 76 feet long.  Making it more than 275 feet in diameter. The only thing I question id why now? Why these recent visits to My area, and almost the exact same area.  Truth be told, since moving out to this area in 2005, I've since UFOs land near by, even to the extent of leaving circles in My back yard.  Some time floating between My property and My neighbors, but never this large or this close.  There must be something going on around here, if not with Me, since I've had several experiences in My entire life with these things, and for generations apparently.

      "story": "Missing Time and Military Helicopter My son was about 1 year old and it was one of the normal evenings when my husband was \"out in the field\".  He was often gone for up to two months at a time, and I felt quite at ease being alone.  It was late fall, but the temperature outside was nice enough for me to be able to go outside in my shorts.  The \"Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson was just going off the air and I was sitting down to watch the \"Tomorrow Show\" with Tom Snyder.  I remember this night because it was the premiere episode.  October 15th, 1973.   I could hear a beeping noise coming from outside and thought that it might have been one of the electrical transformers, so I went outside to see if I could find it.  There was not a hint of a breeze in the night air and it was fairly cool out.  There seemed to be no noise except the beeping.  I stood in the yard for a couple of minutes just listening, and then I heard a police siren coming my direction from the main road.  I went to the north side of the house to try to see what was happening but was blocked by all the pine trees.   Then I heard a helicopter coming from a distance and that was when I noticed strange lights fairly low to the ground to my east.  There should have been no lights in that direction because there was nothing that way except ten to fifteen miles of forest.   I walked down the street about 4 houses to see the main road behind the house and watched as something zoomed by.  It was just above the tree line, about 40 feet in the air, and was traveling so fast I couldn\u2019t tell anything specific about it other than it was very well lit.  The 2 police cars zoomed by headed south following whatever was flying in front of them.  Then came the helicopter.  They stopped about a mile down the road, turned off their lights and returned in the direction of Ft. Bragg.  I turned around to see the lights in the forest and they were still in the same spot.  That was when they lifted to just above tree height and then blinked out.  I had no re! ason to be frightened but ran back in to the house anyway.  That was when I noticed that the television station had gone off the air.  The \"Tomorrow Show\" should have still been on because I had only been outside for maybe five minutes.  I checked the clock and it was now nearly two in the morning.  The show came on at 12:30 and went off at 1:30.  What had happened to that hour and a half?",

      "story": "Mysterious bright light spotted hovering over wooded area I reside in Fayetteville, NC, and I live in an apartment on the second floor.  I occasionally open my bedroom blinds at night to get beautiful views of the moon & stars.   Tonight around 10p.m., I opened my blinds, turned out my bedroom light and laid in bed gazing out of the window slightly to the right of where the moon is usually visible with hopes of witnessing the meteor shower.  After looking toward the sky for sometime a bright light appeared and I noticed it was actually hovering over the woods in the back of my apartment complex.  I watched the bright light as closely as possible to rule out the possibility of it being a drone being operated by someone nearby, it wasn't.   I called my husband to come look and he saw it as well.  The bright light hovered for about 30 mins in the same spot and faster then I could blink it disappeared.   The moon & stars are not even visible tonight due to the frequent thunderstorms we are having so the only explanation is that it! was certainly an extraterrestrial sighting.",

Since it is just to the south of me that was my first thought.   That point I realized that there wasn't a sound being produced and it was headed towards the ground faster than a jet could travel or any man made craft for that matter.  Best way to describe it was a green fireball with greenish-whiteish tail/trail behind it.  Only lasted for a few seconds at the most.  I even waited for a crash or explosion sound to rule out any crash that could've happened.",
