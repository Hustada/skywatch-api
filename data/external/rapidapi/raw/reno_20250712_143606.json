      "story": "Group of four points of light moving in a deliberate and manner unconventional for aircraft or satellites Sighting Friday 4/28/06 @ 9:35P Location Reno, NV (39.525 Lat, 119.777 Long) Witnessed by husband and wife  Facing South-West I noticed nearly directly overhead four bright points of light of equal intensity in shape of square parallelogram spaced possibly 0.25-0.5 degrees Initial brightness 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than any other star in that part of the night's sky Color similar as other stars and constant (other than fading intensity noted below) Absolutely no other physical features were discernible Absolutely no sound observed  Points of light then changed positions several times in a smooth manner relative to each other in a pattern similar to a shell game, then deliberately aligned into a line of four abreast, then finally into four in a row before fading from vision while moving North - North-West at what appeared to be a constant speed on the order of but slightly slower than that of an orbital satellite.  During the first part of the observation the group of lights passed through a portion of the sky that was brightly illuminated vertically by the exterior lights of a nearby large hotel and resulted in causing the lights to appear to shimmer (similar to atmospheric distortion) as they crossed the cone of light.  Objects observed for a duration of approximately 45 seconds (from 90 degrees to approximately 45 degrees above the horizon)  Group intensity faded uniformly as objects moved in a Northerly direction until no longer visible  Approximately 3-4 minutes later a solo object (similar point of light but intensity 2-3 orders of magnitude lower) followed same track as first group but at a somewhat higher speed.  Object disappeared within approximately 10-15 seconds  Observer (author) has Masters degree in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering with experience in orbital vehicles and orbital mechanics and is a sworn peace officer.",

My guess was approx 15K feet in elevation.  This event was from horizon to horizon.  Strangely these craft going east to southeast cut straight across the landing path of an approaching airliner heading into RNO . One lead craft and the following craft appeared to be following from the rear in the 8 oclock position.  As I mentioned they were silent. Both craft had only red slowly strobing lights.  They lights blinked in an alternating sequence.  The front craft first then the rear craft.  This pattern repeated constantly from the beginning to the end of the event.  The lights appreared to be on the tips of wings if it had wings.  Not on top just on the ends.  No green or white lights were seen. No sound of prop or jet propulsion.  The skies were dark and the weather is broken clouds..55 degrees and 41% humidity.",

      "story": "Possible anti gravity propulsion system. First Reporting date: 9/24/1998 Reported to: Art Bell on Coast to Coast Show by fax. I would like to take this opportunity to report a possible Unidentified Flying Object [UFO]and share some insight into the greenish and while lights that are being seen in the sky. Five years ago, in 1993, I had a very close encounter or you could refer to it as a standoff with an Unidentified Flying Object [UFO] in the Reno, Nevada, area.  Excuse my pun, but I may be able to shed some light on the subject of UFO\u2019s.  I cannot tell you exactly what it was, but I can tell you that it was not a fixed wing or helicopter that was currently known to the general public and there for unidentified. My military background includes an active duty tour in the U.S Air Force as an Aircraft Maintenance Specialist on F-111\u2019s and other tactical fighter aircraft and over 20 years as a Security Forces Specialist and Supervisor.  I have extensive experience in Search and Rescue Air Support with both fixed wing and military helicopters. In this particular incident, I was working as a Sheriff\u2019s Deputy on swing shift and had worked overtime until around 0300 hrs. in the morning.  I changed into my street clothing and put my Glock 9mm in my pancake style holster on my pants belt and put another magazine into my rear pocket.  I got into my Chevy 4x4 pickup truck and headed Northbound on highway 395 and to my residence in the Cold Springs Valley area near the Nevada/California boarder. At about 0330 hours, I crested a hill on Hwy. 395 at started to drop down in elevation towards the Cold Springs Valley.  I observed a bright white circular light moving back and forth across the base of Pevine Mountain near the Southbound lanes of Highway 395, which is several miles from the old Crystal Peak Mine access road. The area is about 5400 feet in elevation and the white light looked to be about 150 feet, above ground level or AGL.  At first, I thought that it might have been a Nevada Army National Guard OH-58 helicopter with a search light mounted on it, although I did not remember one on any of the aircraft I had flew on during search and rescue.  I did not see any formation lights, not strobes or anti-collision lights. At the bottom of the hill, I took the exit and pulled up to the stop sign. I sat there for a couple of minutes.  I shut my engine and lights off to listen to the sound of the main roto blades and did not hear anything.  The intensity of the bright light did not change as the object moved in a circular pattern and a nose mounted searchlight or a side mounted searchlight would have varied in intensity as the nose of the helicopter turned. I watched the bright light for about 3-4 minutes, before restarting my truck and turning on to Cold Springs Drive to drive around the dry lake bed.  While driving around the lake bed, I thought that another vehicle was catching up to me, as I would see some light and then it was gone.  After driving around the lake bed, I turned onto Brant Street and drove about 2 and half miles to my residence. As I pulled into my driveway and got out of my truck, I noticed that the very bright light was traveling along Brant Street at about 150 feet above the roadway towards my position. I moved out into the middle of the culdesac where it was dark and just stood there to try to get a glimpse of what type aircraft it was.  The nearest street light was about half a block away, so I felt a little safe in the dark.  My first thought was, \"Great, the object followed me home.\" The object was moving about 15-20 miles per hour and maintaining about 150-200 feet AGL.  I attempted to observe the outline of the object, but the brightness of the white light prevented it, and the intensity was much brighter that a searchlight that can be mounted on helicopters.  The light seemed to form a round disk type area about 100 ft. in diameter and was the only outline to judge the size of the object.  The object stopped moving towards me and remained stationary in the air with no main rotor blade or tail rotor noise. I was able to observe that there was a greenish hue to the white light emitting from the bottom of the object and said in a loud voice, \u201cOh, so that light is actually a low attitude propulsion system\u201d.  I was surprised when the object moved sideways about 15 feet, as if answering the question. I got the feeling that I was being observed by a FLIR system- Forward Looking Infrared Radar.  I decided to wait this situation out, as I did not want to identify my house with a sleeping family. I was having a standoff with an UFO and I was thinking to myself, I bet they never abducted a cop with a Glock before and reached down and padded my Glock on my hip. I was hoping that the object would cross over me or move past me slowly, so I could get a look at the underside of the object.  The object maintained a silent hover for about 15 minutes as I stood still.  After about another five minutes, I decided to press the issue and threw up my hands and said very loudly, \u201dWell, what are you going do, do something\u201d. The white light underneath the object became a greenish/ white color, with what looked like greenish water droplets as big as silver dollars spitting out the bottom for about 10 to 15 feet.  Then the greenish, white light shot straight up into the sky and was gone in about three seconds. I hung around for about another five minutes expecting the object to return since we were so close, but the object did not return and I searched the sky and did not see anything except the stars. I had feeling at the time that the object that followed me home may have been a either a Black Project from the Southern Desert area, or just a UFO. I did not mention the incident to anyone at the time as it would not have been politically incorrect to do so and could have been detrimental to my law enforcement carrier.",

      "story": "A cigar-shaped craft about 100-200 feet, hovering, yellowish-orange with red and white lights.  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I am quite certain it was on a Tuesday night between 8 and 9pm that I (age 11) and the rest of my family (mom, age 36; brother, age 12; brother, age 17) saw the craft. The popular TV show MASH was on in our living room which faced Colorado Blvd, the street where we lived. My mother and two brothers were in the living room watching MASH, and I was in the family room watching another TV show. I could see and hear through our kitchen into our living room, where the rest of my family was watching television. I began to hear some excitement coming from the living room and went in to see what was going on. My whole family was staring out the window when suddenly my brother (17) darted to his room to get a camera and out the front door he went. I took his place at the window and was amazed at what I saw. Above the houses across the street and hovering, was a cigar-shaped disc, about 100-200 feet long, bright, with what I can remember as alternating white and red lights. Things began to happen very fast and the excitement was none like I\u2019ve experienced before. We all were outside within seconds of me entering the living room to see what was going on. Once outside, my brother (17) easily scaled onto our roof via our front porch. My other brother (12) ran out into the front yard. I can remember my mother being very concerned, she kept me by her side as we continued to watch from our front porch. My brother\u2019s camera was a cheap Kodak with a flash, but in the dark, he was unlucky at getting any kind of exposure. Anyway, we watched the craft through the tall trees, hover back and forth, over the houses, for about two minutes. The trees were not in bloom as of yet (my estimated date of 4/1 very easily could have been late February or March) and I could see the object through the trees. Another aspect that I am certain of is that I could see through the craft, I mean, it was a clear starry night, facing Mt. Rose and Slide Mountain, part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains which are easily visible on a clear ! day. At night, however, all one could see were the stars, and I can remember seeing the stars through the outline of the craft, which was bright orange-yellow. The lights I mentioned earlier went from one end to the other, through the center of the cigar shape. The strangest thing about our sighting is that is seemed very dark and quiet on our street for that time of night. Not one of our neighbors, who we all knew very well, were outside at that time, and not a single vehicle drove by. The episode, as I said, lasted about two minutes. The last thing I remember is that it all of the sudden disappeared, either from speeding away, or vanishing into thin air, I can\u2019t say which. I am confident the year was 1975 for a number of reasons which I won\u2019t get into here for this could get very long. I will say that this sighting has never left my consciousness. I rarely tell anyone and very rarely discuss it with my family. I can also say that the experience immediately (within one year) turned me and my mother into UFO buffs, of a sort. I can remember reading my first UFO book (Project Blue Book) I checked out at my school library (Vaughn Middle School). Ever since we\u2019ve shared information and still do to this day, but we rarely venture into a conversation about that night. The experience has changed my life, and at the ripe age of almost forty-three, my interest has peaked so much that I have finally taken the time to write it down. That night we called the radio station and they thought we were joking. I told my friends at school and they didn\u2019t believe my either. I do remember my mother telling us one of here friends from the hospital where she worked, spotted the craft. This person, according to my mom lived across Plumb Lane, so it made sense that she could have seen the same thing we did.

A large perfectly round glowing object caught my eye as it came into my field of vision above me in my front window of my car heading the exact same direction at an extremely fast speed. At first I thought it was a falling star beacuase of the speed that it traveled across the sky, but then I realized it was traveling way too low and it was way too large, and it was glowing yellow not white as typical of the falling stars I have seen often. At that point my mind told me it must be a meteor but here was absolutely no trail behind it. Then it came to a sudden halt but never diminished in brightness, and then just totally became invisible, like it turned its light off. I got I weird gut feeling like this was something I could not explain. Everyone in the car was freaking out because they were all equaly scared. The only other time I had this feeling was in Seattle ,WA in May 1977 at approxiamtely 9:00 p.m. when a small craft the size of a small car followed our car full of five people through a road with tall trees on both sides just floating behind our vehicle, you could see it in the rear view mirror. It was a typical saucer like design that consisted of four rows of glowing windows. Our car died in the middle of the road and we were not able to start it for about a minute. Everyone was hysterical and terrified. Just was curious if anyone else saw the Reno meteor/light in the sky?",

After spotting a couple of normal ones, I saw a very unusual one. This one\u2019s flight characteristic seemed to be like a butterfly in a strong breeze except very, very high up (high up enough to reflect sunlight at about 4:15am).  It appeared to be climbing in altitude quickly also. It was headed in a southerly direction and headed into Orion. As it climbed, it seemed to slow and then just lazily move towards the westerly foot (star name = Rigel) of Orion. I pointed this out to a passing stranger who showed no particular interest. As it reached Rigel, it slowed to a stop and reversed course. It was as faint as a smaller satellite at this point, and proceeded slowly in a northern direction past Meissa (Orion\u2019s head), past Mars and to Triangulum. At approximately the star Perseus, the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the east and started to slowly accelerate at first. A couple of women with their 2 children came to sit next to me and I pointed this out to them, they focused in quickly, and the object accelerated  to the point that it went from almost straight above us to the horizon in about 2 seconds while the apparent size grew from a small, dim star to a large size star. I have watched the stars since I was a child, and have studied astronomy for decades. The flight characteristics of this object matched no known aircraft that I have ever heard of as far as fluttering, ability to make an instantaneous 90 degree turn at high velocity, or speed. To go from straight above to beyond the horizon at that altitude constitutes speeds that NASA could not duplicate in their wildest dreams.",

After several minutes the two objects shot straight up and out of view. We then noticed fighter jets circling the sky where the object(s) had been. I have taken a photo of it with my cell phone camera and so did my friends girl friend. I also took a photo of the fighter jets.  I went to several websites, and it did not exemplify the behavior of the naked eye GRB that took place that day, nor did it seem like a star in keeping with the rotation of the Earth as it would only move in one direction if this were the case. I also went to see if it was a satellite, no luck there. I'm at a loss to explain this in conventional terms. These objects were witnessed by several people in the downtown Reno area.

I saw a distinct green circular shape moving at an extremely high speed from the Northeast to a Southwest direction.  It appeared the object was descending, but this could have been an illusion.  It appeared it was low, approx. 500-1000 ft.  (If I held a ruler up in front of my eyes the object would have measured about 1/4\" in diameter). There was no sound, like a military jet travelling at high speed might make.  I could not be sure if what I was seeing was propulsion from a craft or not.  It was dark and I could not see any shape other than the large green circle. I would estimate it traveled at least 4 miles in about 3 seconds as I had a view of the whole Reno valley.  It was moving much more rapidly than I would expect an civilian or government aircraft (planes or helicopters) to be traveling at.

There were some chemtrail clouds drifting south. The sphere moved very slowly towards me in over the downtown Reno metropolitan area. It took up a position over McCarren Blvd. and remained motionless for approx. 5 mins. It then moved closer to my position on a straight course but ever so slowly. At first I thought it was a balloon but it maintained its course on a straight trajectory. It stopped over the northern Sparks area and held position. It seemed to emminate its own white luminious light source. It appeared under intelligent control. Suddenly off to my left appeared a diamond [mother-of-pearl] shaped craft. It seemed to have dimensional structure to its outer shape. I glissened and gleamed various beautiful colors in the late afternoon sunlight.  One moment it seemed to look like a triangle then would alter its dimensional features appearing more diamond shaped. It moved with the same slow movemnt as the first sphere which was also visible at the same time the diamond was overhead. The diamond moved forward ever so slowly then took up position over the University of Reno. It remained stationary for 6-7 mins then began a very slow path floating back and forth slightly. It then began it final course 90 degs to it previous path heading west. It was the same altitude as the clouds [chemtrail clouds] which were blowing east in the wind. But the diamond was moving AGAINST the wind as it advance head-on past the clouds. I watched it till it was out of sight. This all took approx 25-30 mins.  The first sphere also was now undetectable by vision. It was also gone.",

I was waiting for management to arrive at a new building where I was installing software. While I was in the rental vehicle listening to a college football game I noticed fish were jumping out of the lake. I live in Las Vegas and I very rarely get to see any wildlife 'in action'.  So I sat there and watched this for a few minutes when my eyes caught sight of what I thought were three birds. It was dark and I figured that lights in the distance had illuminated the birds. The birds were headed north but then banked to their right and completed a 270 degree turn. Now they were headed west, right in my direction. The area is very close to the airport and after I figured out the lights were not birds, I braced myself for a plane crash because the 270 degree turn was very fast, low, and heading lower. But once it straightened out, the lights started moving in my direction. I watched this object silently move across the sky (Had to be only 300 FT off the ground and I'd say roughly 1000 FT in front of me and I cannot judge the speed though I'd guess 200 MPH) and it went behind a tree line. I looked to the other side of the tree line expecting to see the object but nothing appeared. When I glanced up before the lights passed the tree line I could not make out any object but there were certainly three points that if you connected the dots you could make out a triangle. The rental car was idling but there was very little engine noise and I did not hear any noise from the object. There were no blinking lights and what made this even more interesting was about 20 seconds after the object went behind the tree line a plane landed. It was a small plane and I was thinking they had to have seen something!  I was in a complete sober state of mind. I called the Reno PD to see if anyone had reported the same thing and they said no.",

I and one of my brothers were visiting our brother in Reno, Nevada over Christmas.  His house is in the Cold Springs Valley area!  I stepped outside his garage to have a cigarette, on the side of his home.  It was still dark outside, but with a faint glow of the sun just barely starting to lighten the sky.  Not knowing exactly which direction his house faces, I will only suggest that I was on the east side of it at this time!  Being a believer of this type of thing, I always watch the skies in the hope that I will see something, and this time I did!  I was looking upwards, and I had high thin clouds to my right, but the skies were mostly clear.  I looked to my left more, and caught a fain object shoot past my field of vision at a very high rate of speed!  And I mean fast!  As I said, maybe only 2 seconds of viewing time!  What ever it was, it was not at an altitude to be lit by any sunlight because there was only a hint of lightening of the sky at this early hour!  And I saw it for such a short time span, than I can't even tell you what shape it was, either!  It was there, and then gone!  It's size I would approximate as being about the size of a pencil eraser, held about 8-10 feet away, looking straight on.  I went inside and told my brothers about this and one suggested that it might have been a bird!  But this was way too fast to be a bird!  And the other, which I tend to partially agree with suggested that it might have been a meteor!  The one problem I have with this is that I don't know a great deal about celestial bodies, but this seemed an awful lot closer to the ground than a meteor!  I would say no farther than 7-9,000ft above me!  I tried to follow it's path, to see if it would reflect any light from somewhere, but, nothing! It was pretty faint, and was gone really too quickly!",

It was a disk-like shape with many yellow-white lights moving in a circular motion around the craft.  The object also had one small red light near the top center of the craft.  I pointed the object out to my boyfriend and within about a minute, the object had moved all the way across the valley of Reno, NV, and could barely be seen anymore. We noticed that a helicopter came relatively close to the object several times, but the object seemed unaffected by its presence. We decided to attempt to follow the craft to investigate further.  As we drove across the city, the craft moved closer and farther away, sometimes hovering in one spot for several moments.  At one point, we got near enough to the craft that we could see with the unaided eye its true shape.  It was still disk shaped, but it had become apparent to us that there were two rows of lights instead of one, spin! ning around the craft in a circular motion.  At our closest, the object was a few hundred feet in the air away from us.  At this point, the object turned onto its side, much like a Frisbee rolling on the ground, then turned back to its flat side, and began again to move away from where we parked. We continued to drive throughout the city to get closer, but the object eventually disappeared from sight altogether.  In the dark it was very difficult to see the full shape of the object, but I and my boyfriend are certain that this was no helicopter, plane, or child's toy.  We attempted to both photograph and videotape the object, but neither method was successful in picking up the image.  To clarify, neither of us have ever seen anything like this.  We are both young college students with no history of mental illness.  We have seen TV shows regarding these kinds of incidents, and have always found them to be exaggerated and quite unrealistic.  After today, we are unsure what to believe and are searching for some sort of logical explanation.",

He was sitting on this front porch stoop (facing West) and noticed a silver sparkling object   appearing  to travel  up the side of Peavine mountain.  At first he thought it was a helicopter but ruled this out due to the rapid ascent and abrupt changes in directions without regard to being on a road or paths that were visible on the side of the mountain.  He indicated he observed this object for about 30 seconds then decided to get his binoculars and camera. He then observed this object going above the top of Peavine in a westerly or north-westerly direction.  He used is Canon digital camera with the 40 power  lens  and took three pictures, only two frames captured the object which  was just a small dot in the totally blue sky background.  He was so excited that he yelled at me to come and see the object which was shimmering in the sky at some distance, I used his binoculars then got my binoculars to observe the shinny and our US Postman also observed the object. While using my binoculars and observing the object, it sped different directions and reversed course very rapidly, unlike any normal flying craft.   Finally it was no longer visible to me and the other observers. After the sighting, the neighbor downloaded the captured images approximately 400X and it was a very distinct object with the magnification used by the computer.  He will forward the original digital image without magnification and other photos indication the approximate angle of sighted object in the sky from out vantage point on San Simeon Ct.

When traveling back we took a stop in Reno, Nevada.  From there we spent the night at a motel, Motel 8, and then, in the morning, upon departure, we saw, what we thought to be, a UFO. There was a bright light, it then turned into a turquoise color and seemed to disappear.  We then heard heavy winds, from inside the car, and then we saw lots of dust and a dim light. I believe we saw some kind of creature approaching us.   My friends and I, were shocked when we saw it and panicked on whether we should go back to Elko or continue into California.  We continued our trip until we arrived in Sacramento, which is where we \u201cstole\u201d Internet, from the hotel we were outside of, to search up about UFO\u2019s.   We then found this website\u2019s number and called it, when we were off of the plane and traveling back to where we reside.",

I don't remember how long we stood there, but I remember looking at the other people and at this ball, and then all of a sudden jet fighters took off from right behind the MGM Hotel/Casino and the ball shot off at a extremely high speed and was just gone and then the 2 jets took off the same direction.

It was bright and very bold looking in the sky, as nothing could compare to its size or speed.  Best way for me to explain its size is if a star is pin size the object would be pea size.  I can\u2019t imagine it saw it for more than 5 seconds.  It disappeared behind the clouds and I saw it again through the opening of clouds for maybe another second then it went be clouds again.

This is fairly hilly/mountainous terrain, and it was dark, so I assumed it was a light on a hilltop, or perhaps on a tower.  As I got close it became obvious the light was moving slowly from east to west.  I initially dismissed this as an optical illusion since there was no background other than dark night sky, but the road is pretty straight and the light clearly moved from the left to the right side of the road and got brighter. I alerted the rest of my family in the car, who also witnessed the object.  As we got closer we noticed that there was a blue light on one side and a green light on the other.  As we approached I saw what appeared to be a semi-circle of light with blue on the left and green on the right (from my perspective).  I could never make out any detail other than the lights.  I would estimate the object was less than 1000\u2019 AGL.  I am a pilot with over 20 years of experience in military fighters.  The light configuration was unusual and did not conform to normal aircraft position lights (green/red on wingtips and white tail).",

About the same time I looked up it changed color from white to red and seemed to change direction because the shape went from Round to Oblong.  After watching it change color and shape for about five minutes we noticed a low flying plane coming quick from the opposite side of the craft.  As the plane got closer to the craft it was as if someone turned a light switch off because the light from the craft was gone except for a real strange glow emitting from the craft. My wife and I thought it just disappeared and thought the strange sighting was over.  As the plane descended and disappeared over Reno the light came back as if a switch was hit again and was closer and brighter than before.  My wife and I continued to watch from the road for a total of about 40 mins and we could see the light pulsing and move from one spot to another with speed faster than any aircraft we have ever seen. This craft seemed to descend and ascend repeatedly and go from North to South. As we watched the craft it seemed to change color many times and continued into the sky north until it was completely out of sight.",

My field of view is mostly overhead to east south east, and south, with tree blockage to the west of me.  Most of the city light is blocked out in my back yard, but with typical diffuse light to the eye. I think I am pretty good at identifying that, which is an airplane in the air, or other having grown up around aviators, and people in the space industry. What I saw tonight was moving not as fast as say a meteorite would, like a streak, nor was it the slow steady pace of an airliner over head.   I am pretty familiar with the flight patterns and speeds of various craft overhead, helicopters or what have you, and with Reno airport nearby, it is easy to tell airplanes around. This \u201cufo\u201d was orange in color, very high in the sky.  There were lower lying clouds tonight overhead, so I could tell it was above that cover.  It was moving from west to easterly direction, and man, this was not any airplane I have ever seen.   Very fast moving, but with purpose.  It was saucer to egg, to oval shaped, leaving no trail behind it.  There was no noise, though from my location sometimes you can hear very high up aircraft in later evenings. This was pretty weird to me, enough to want to report it, but was also wondering if anyone else in the Reno area saw something they questioned tonight.  Were there any low flying satellites tonight in that trajectory and time, that is possible what I saw?   I honestly don\u2019t think it was THAT high, not space high; definitely in airspace air.

When I looked up I saw what appeared to be a rectangular like object about the size of a small plane with a triangular like top to it that came to a point. This craft looked like it was inspecting this one cloud. There were no wings and no noise. It had blue, green and pinkish streeks coming from the back that looked kind of like what a rocket has behind it when it takes off yet it was not thick nor looked like it was exhaust of anykind. The object was a light metalic silver. It moved around this cloud in such a way and in such speed unlike anything any of our normal average citizens know about that exist in ! our world. Then it just went POOF! Dissappeared just like that, right in front of our eyes. I do know we have nothing that can just dissapear in the blink of an eye, a flash of a second right in front of you. If I could draw a picture it would be imagined like this. The cloud was pretty small and the object went up, stopped, went down behind the cloud, back up through the cloud, then around it and back up then stopped, hovered by this cloud touching the edge of it with its nose and then back behind it, then it went back out and hovered for a second then POOF, it dissappeared. The movements were not of this world. It did not make turns. It just went up then down then through and around and out, its hard to explain it perfectly how it moved. It just did not move like any jets, planes, rockets we have and IT WAS NOT A DAMN WEATHER BALLOON either. There is no EXPLAINING this one away for me.

I noticed it as I walked out in my backyard to have a smoke. The light appeared to be above the mountains in the SSW of the valley, which lead to Lake Tahoe, not sure how high. At first, I thought maybe it was Jupiter or another large planet, but my stargazer app showed Jupiter in the northeast sky and nothing significantly large or bright in the area where I was looking. After about a minute of admiring what I assumed was a strange bright star or planet, it began to move northward. It moved at a slow pace much slower than what I am use to seeing the average plain in the night sky move, also there were no flashing lights, and I could hear no noise, simply a brilliant light blue light floating across the sky. After it ! left my view from the back yard, which was obstructed by the roof of my house, I decided to go out front to see if it was still there and it was. The light appeared to still be traveling at the same rate of speed, but a few seconds after spotting the light in the front yard it stopped, this time hovering in the northeast sky. Exited that it might actually be a UFO, I ran in to grab a small \u201cmoongazer\u201d telescope, set it up out front, and located the craft with a 20mm lens, but it still just looked like a light, so I tried a 12mm, 6mm, and 4mm lens in the telescope. Through the 4mm lens, I could see that it was emitting a bright blue glow, and had Blues, reds, oranges and other colors, which I could not quite make out, shimmering all around it, although it still looked like a ball of light. I am not too sure how long it stayed there because I went in to check on my daughter around 5:40 and when I came out to gather my telescope equipment the sun was rising. I could no longer ! tell if it was there.",

Yesterday,  I stepped out to get my mail and a glint in the sky (like a small glint of metal) caught my eye.  I looked at it and saw an unusual object moving from right to left, very high in altitude and moving unusually slowly.  All I can say is that it was long, very large and if I had to make a comparison, would say it was cylindrical in shape, but can't be sure of that due to its distance.   There was another plane at high altitude in the sky with it some distance to the southwest (not in pursuit, probably a commercial aircraft) and it was clearly leaving a contrail but whatever this was, was not.   I leaned down to get my mail out of the mailbox, which took all of 3 seconds, looked back up fully expecting it to be there and it had completely vanished.  I'm a little frustrated at myself for taking my eyes off of it, I would have liked to have seen how it just apparently blinked out.",

      "story": "consumed the surrounding light like a vampire.   distant benevolence?...... none. At approx 03:00am on May 04 2013 while walking around the backside of our property (top of Wedekind rd. & McCarran blvd in Reno, Nevada), a slight (yet rather noticeable) motion within my periphery had grabbed my attention.  I turned to look up toward the south end of town. At about 20*deg above average horizon there was an object moving upward at a slight arc from the east.  The object traveled at a speed of approx 2+*deg per/second across the sky towards the west/s.west direction.  This is quite a bit faster than any satellite I would usually see at this hour. The size of the object if compared to a satellite (without assuming any equal distance in orbit, but merely by observable perspective) would be like comparing the sharpened tip of a pencil (satellite) with the eraser of a pencil (object) held at arms length.  The shape was of an oval, but lacked a solidly defined edge entirely. The object could have been dismissed entirely as a massive satellite ( perhaps the I.S.S. on re-entry?) or even a commercial airliner below 20,000ft.  Instead of completing an arc across the sky, it abruptly changed it's course \u00be the way and dropped downward, as if it just suddenly fell from the sky (in a very fast & controlled manner). The whole time this was being witnessed I had this very strange feeling that this object had become very aware that it was being watched, I felt this most intensely just before it fell towards the earth, as if offended by my staring at it.  However, the disturbing part had to be the way it was illuminated (or lack of illumination).  It was a VERY dark orange/pink color. It seemed as if it absorbed it's light from its surroundings, almost like some kind of parasitic negative image, or maybe like a black-hole. It glowed.... yet, it didn't.  It's surface was like a soft dark rubberized orange/pink haze... it glowed like it it was lit by some distant black-light tube.  But I swear it consumed the surrounding light like a vampire. This is not my first time seeing this phenomena in our town.  This solo one just confirmed the strange cluster formation that left myself and a friend shocked and questioning our existence this last year.  I don't believe there visiting has any distant benevolence...... none.",

Then as I went about 8 more miles I realized I was getting closer and closer.  Once I reached a straight away I realized that the ufo was actually hovering right over the freeway.  Once I got closer I noticed it had three circular white lights in a triangular formation pointing east towards me.  I remember wondering if it was looking right at me.  To the northeast at the same time I saw one more set of lights same color and brightness about 10 or 15 miles  away.  Going back to the first one, I came up to it like I was looking at the mountains going 70 miles an hour.  It appeared to be fixed in one place just hovering the lights flickering as jet engines look when they\u2019re firing.  The light was so bright that as I drove directly under it, the light reflected off! my car, and it must have been 1000 feet up or more but the light was bright enough that I could see a faint grey outline of what looked like a boomerang, fat in the middle with triangle lights and then I lost sight of it behind my windshield.  When I looked again about two miles down the road I could no longer see either craft maybe because they were too high up to see in my rear view mirror.  At 19:49 I called the national ufo hotline.",

I would like to report a UFO sighting which my husband and I had this afternoon, February 28, 2013, approximately 3:30 p.m.  Big, puffy, white clouds and blue sky.  Bright sunshine. We were sitting outside at our picnic table, talking. I was drinking iced tea, he had beer, and we enjoying the warm, sunny weather, when I commented on the jet passing over our heads.  It seemed to be rather low, or very large.  As we were looking up, He said, \"There's an object!!\" and pointed.   I looked up, and didn't see anything unusual, \"Where?\"  \"There!!!  An object!!\"  I squinted and looked harder, and my eyes fell upon a tiny, silvery white spot in the blue sky, just on the edge of a cloud.  \"Wow!  What is it?\" \"I don't know!!\" So, I jumped up and ran in for the 2 binocular cameras we have for bird watching. When I came out, it was still there.  The cloud had moved, but the object was in the same spot.  We each took a camera and tried to focus on the shiny object.   We could see it better, but it was still only a shiny round sphere, hanging in the sky.  It was not bouncing or moving and appeared too large to be a mylar balloon.   When I tried to click a photo of it, my batteries were dead, same with the other camera!  That's when another commercial jet came from the north.   I jumped up to run into the house to grab my Canon Rebel with 300 zoom lens.   He yells, \"It's going!\",  as I ran into the house. When I came back out carrying the zoom camera, he said again, \"It's going!  It's moving like a bat outta hell!\" I tried to catch it with the zoom lens and focus, but it was moving too fast.  But, I clicked a picture in case it could get SOMETHING.  He exclaimed, \"It's going!\"   When that plane appeared, it took off like a bat outta hell!!  3 times faster than the plane!!\"   Suddenly, another one appeared right behind it, out of the clear blue sky!!  The first one did a \"swoosh\" upward and toward the southeast, and the second one also did a \"swoosh\" upward and to the southeast, exactly like the first!  They disappeared right before our eyes!  He commented, \"They were going 3 times faster than the jet!  Can you believe that?!!  We saw a UFO!!  What do you think of that?!!   All I could say was, \"Cool!!\"",

      "story": "12-15 Illuminated objects hovering and flying in formation then shooting upward and disappearing into the sky On September 25, 2014, at approximately 1940 hours, I was outside walking my dog, when I heard a teenag boy nearby shout \"Oh my god, look at that!\" as he pointed into the sky.  He was speaking to his friend who was standing next to him and when I looked over they were both looking up in the air pointing.   From where I was standing the trees were blocking by view so I quickly ran over and as soon as I could see the sky, I was blown away, as I initially saw a formation of aircraft moving through the sky; there were approximately 6-7.   I then looked further to the right and saw a second formation in the sky of 6-8 more.  They seemed to temporarily hover in the air and then continue to move sideways through the sky in formation.  They all looked just like a solid bright light and what caught everyone's attention is that they were all flying so close together, or at least closer than an normal aircraft would fly together.   Also, they appeared to be far higher in the air than I had ever seen any aircraft in my life, and that includes my time in the military and and as a civilian.  I have never seen even military aircraft moving in that type of formation.  They were extremely high in the air.  Higher than I believed normal aircraft could fly.   There were two aircraft that were not flying within the formations and were larger and brighter than the others in formations and it was amazing because they would be moving in one direction and then instantly change direction at like 45 degree angles unlike anything I had ever seen and s movement normal aircraft is not capable of doing.  It was not a turn it was an instantaneous pivot in the sky.  Those two appeared to be able to fly more freely but also seemed to be guiding the formations almost like how one man marches a formation of soldiers; he is not part of the formation but he is giving the orders on how they move.  And then there was one other aircraft that was flying out of both the formations, and was also brighter and bigger than the others. At this point I ran over to my house to inform my wife to get me the number for the local press and for the local police (who referred me to your call center).  While she did that I pulled out my ipod and began recording their movements through the sky and narrating the entire experience.  As I looked up I noticed three aircraft that were not in the formations could no longer be seen. I ran back to the two guys who were still there watching.  They explained that the three big and bright aircraft had all disappeared.  They said that two of them had shot up into the air making an X and then disappeared into the sky.  They said the third one simply moved upward quickly and then disappeared as well.   I again went back over to my house and by at this time I could no longer see any of the aircraft.  Then entire incident took what looked like directly over the Reno Airport.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I did did not know whether to be amazed or scared as I am not sure what they were doing there.   At this time I do not wish to include my video recording of the event due to the sensitivity of the content.",

We were watching a large lightning show that had gone on for over 1 hour.  It was very intense, but though there was enormous amounts of lightning; we heard no thunder. At about 1:30 am, our 1st floor room began to shake\u2026we both thought earthquake!  Then we heard a very loud noise like a giant vacuum going very slowly overhead!  We could feel a large amount of energy that made all ((deleted--2nd woman's)) hair stand on end and cause ((deleted--1st woman)) to be nauseous. We looked at each other with wide eyes, and both said simultaneously, \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d  Then a very bright white light appeared outside the window.  The light seemed very low\u2026barely clearing the top of the 2 story hotel.  It was angled down toward the ground.  We thought it was finished going over, but then a second round of the very loud bass sound began crossing the ceiling.  We determined that there were either 2 objects or on very large object with 2 engines.  There was no light accompanying the second sound. Things that were hanging in the room were swaying. ((female #2)) ran outside to see what it was but because of the trees and height of the surrounding hotels was unable to see anything but the light moving very slowly.  She heard what she could only describe as loud mechanical wailing. We waiting to see if we would hear anything else\u2026.like the freeway or maybe airplanes.  We did hear those things but it was NOTHING like the fly by experience.  We were freaked out by it. ((female #2)) began frantically texting her husband, who told her to call 911 if anything else happened.  No other strange happenings occurred, so she did not call. The sound was like nothing either had ever experienced before.  ((femal #2)) grew up next to an international airport and is very familiar with the sounds of helicopters, and even fighter jets.  This was neither of those things.  Both women were convinced that it was an aircraft unlike any they knew of. They were shocked.  ((female #1's))((deleted--teen relative) slept through the whole experience. We could find no reason why a helicopter or plane would fly that slow and low over hotels.  We considered that there is an Emergency Room at the Renown Hospital nearby, but this craft did not fit any of our understanding of a typical helicopter.  It was moving extremely slow, and had a constant bass humming sound...no chopper sound at all. There were dogs in this hotel and they were all barking. ((female #2's)) ears were ringing very loudly from the intense sound.  This lasted until she fell asleep several hours later. Neither of these two women have ever experienced anything like this before and both were trying hard to figure out what it could be...in the end, both agree it was either a secret military craft or a UFO",

The orange lights came different directions to the white light, circled around it and then sped rapidly away in many directions.  This occurred during my observation of all objects until I quit watching approximately 05:45 PST.  My spouse a! lso observed the objects. Location of objects:  The bright non-pulsing white light with the red light on the top or rear was located approximately 240 degrees in the Southwest direction from my property.  It appeared to be 15-20 degrees above the Sierra Nevada mountains (Carson Range) above Lake Tahoe.  I estimate the objects to be 10 to 15 miles distance from my property during the sighting.",

At approximately 0520 hours, myself and a coworker observed a white dot in the sky with a noticeable white ring encircling it.  This was in the north west sky in the north west part of Reno and the dot appeared to be the size of a star.  As we watched, the dot slowly travelled south across the sky.  As the object moved, the encircling white ring disappeared and we could see what appeared to be a cone shaped white light under the original dot.  The cone looked almost like a spotlight under the dot similar to a lampshade.  The object appeared to be extremely high in the sky, did not blink, and made no sound.  The dot seemed to travel just in front of the cone as though the cone part was trailing.  We looked at the object through binoculars as it continued south and eventually out of sight.  The noticeable cone did not change shape and seemed to be an illuminated solid structure. My coworker and I work nightshift patrol as police officers.",

Celestron Skymaster binoculars and my 10x50 Nikon binoculars.,chairs and multiple wireless devices. I usually allow 30 to 45 minutes for my eyes to adjust to the dark however this event took me bu surprise. As I settled into my seat and started scanning the evening skies out of the dark 3 brilliant glowing white lights suddenly appeared. No slow build in intensity they just appeared. The 3 lights were in the shape of a perfect triangle. One on the top and two forming the bottom line of the triangle. My first thought was how interesting it is that 3 satellites suddenly appeared. I picked up my Nikon binoculars and focused on all 3. As I watched all 3 moved in a uniform pattern and never moved from the triangle shape they appeared in. My best guess is they appeared approximately 25 degrees above the skyline and close to 38 degrees north north east. As the triangle moved to the east the light intensity was consistent and brilliant. I continued to observe the 3 uniform lights for approximately 10 more seconds. By this time the lights rapidly faded to black at around 58 degrees north east. And as quickly as they appeared it's like someone hit the light switch. All 3 disappeared. Mr. Davenport, I perform this ritual nightly and have done so for at least 15 years. I know what satellites look like...I understand the way they move through the night skies and slowly faded out of view as the sun reflection passes. I'm not saying this was a UFO but I am saying I've never seen 3 satellites fly in formation and disappear all at once. Very bizarre event over the Northern skies of Reno NV. Take care sir!",

We estimate the size of the object to have been similar to a \u201ctic tac\u201d held at arm\u2019s length.  The weather conditions were clear, although very windy.  The wind was blowing west to east at approximately 40 mph.  We were facing due south and object could be seen at an approximately 70 degree angle above our position.  It did not produce any sound. When we first noticed the object, the sun had not yet set, and the object was very large and very bright.  We initially thought it could have been helicopter or drone hovering over the nearby I-580 freeway.  However, this explanation was disproved when an airliner, flying at cruise altitude with the corresponding contrail, flew underneath the object.  We continued to observe the object for approximately 40-60 minutes.   As the sun set the light appeared to increase in altitude, dimming while doing so, and moving towards the east opposite the normal rotation of the earth and the rising moon/ stars.  By the time the sun had completely set the light appeared to be a normal star in size and brightness.  However, when I used the SkyView app on my phone the object did not correspond to any star, constellation, or satellite in the app\u2019s database.

October 18th 5:10 AM Pyramid Lake, Reno, Nevada  While walking the dog, I saw a flash of light out of the corner of my eye and assumed it was a shooting star.  I expected to see it burn up upon entry into atmosphere.  Instead there were two bright vertical lights in the distance over the lake.  They appeared to hang there for several minutes.  As the lights approached I could see there were actually three large landing type lights in a vertical row.  As the \u2018thing\u2019 turned I could now see several red flashing lights and a couple of green pulsing lights behind them.  What was odd was that they were all vertical and nothing horizontal.  There was not a sound coming from that direction.  As a commercial airline  pilot for 36 years I could not imagine what kind of aircraft could have this light formation and move so quietly.  It traveled horizontally across the lake from south to northwest over the Sierras at a fairly rapid rate.  As it was totally dark out, I could not discern any shape behind the lights.

      "story": "Four glowing cirlces low in the sky in south Reno. I had just arrived home from work around midnight, from May 4 going into May 5.  Low in the sky, over my neighborhood in South Reno, I saw a bright red light in the sky toward the west and a little north.  The light seemed more to radiate, like heat or energy. It wasn\u2019t a steady solid \u201clightbulb\u201d type of light.  It moved, sometimes hoovering, from north to south, before moving up at a 45-degree angle and dimming out high in the sky.  This lasted about a minute.  A second or two after this first light disappeared, three more (identical) appeared, in the same general section of sky as the first.  Two of these lights traveled as a pair, a little higher in the sky than the first one, and the third lagged a little lower than the others.  However, they moved across the same section of sky from north to south, hoovering a little and moving slowly before taking the same angular rise and dimming out.  This lasted about 2 to 3 minutes.  There was no noise, no humming or engi! ne sound.  The light was steady, though it moved like it was \u201cradiating\u201d.

      "story": "Silent lights spiraling above Reno NV in clear night sky I was sitting on my back porch listening to the radio and night sky watching when I observed what at first appeared to be a shooting star.  The light traveled from my left to my right about 5 degrees above the hilly horizon which site North East to East of my home.  The speed was much slower than a shooting star.  The light wasn't sharp or bright brilliant it was as if it was below the surface of the water or behind dairy glass.  It was only a white light as there were no green or red lights which you would see on an aircraft.  No engine noise at all, completely silent.  As the light moved left to right it passed behind a large tree.  Expecting it to come out from behind the tree, I looked to the right side of the tree.  It didn't come back into view.   I then observed the same blurred light flying back to the left and spiraling in a clockwise motion and climbing.  Then the light moved back in a right direction which is south.  Again I see it spiral back to the left and upward.  Now I'm thinking this is not a normal event and I glance down at my table and look for my phone.  I wanted to capture a few pictures if possible.  This is where I lost track of the light.  I didn't see it again.  This entire event lasted maybe 5 to 10 seconds.  I was unable to see a shape only the muted white glow. Thinking about this it was similar to watching a large spotlight on clouds.  However the night skies were absolutely clear..no fog, clouds...no haze or smoke present.  An absolutely beautiful night sky where the Milky Way was so clearly observed.  I'm at a complete loss trying to make logical sense of this sighting.",

I also saw in the north an airline aircraft going west to east.  I calculated the airliner was going in the area of 475-500 m.p.h.

All of the \"stars\" were equally spaced between each other and traveling at a constant speed.

The weather conditions were clear and no sounds were heard.  I am a retired military officer (23 years).  Based upon my extensive military experience, I am 100% confident that this was NOT a military aviation formation, as the speed of the \"stars\" and number of craft observed do not support a military aircraft scenario",
