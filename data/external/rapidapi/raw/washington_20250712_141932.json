      "story": "July 1964, 15:00, Washington, MO, rectangular, 20 min, from north to south, posted 9-28-06. When I was about 13 years, a student of astronomy, interested in aircraft, and the NASA \u201cspace program\u201d, I saw a UFO.  I was at that age a model rocket, math, and science enthusiast.  As an adult I graduated with an engineering degree.  On this special day, it was clear and sunny.  It was in the month of July.  The sky was blue with few clouds and maybe 90 F.  The winds were clam.  I first noticed it coming from the North floating towards the South or South Southeast.  Its speed seemed slow but did travel in a straight line of flight.  The object shape was clearly a rectangle.  Note, it was only a two dimensional object - no thickness.  You could not see through it.  Its color appeared as if it were a solid black - no color changes.  It floated along as if it were a plastic sheet one would hold by hand along the short side in front of a strong fan watching the greater length of plastic flutter very very slowly yet perpendicular to the fan face.  It remained level and with no sound, always keeping the same altitude, same speed, and same direction.  I followed it for nearly 20 minutes and was finally unable to continue.  It just continued southward, in the same direction, same altitude, same speed, unabated.  To ascertain a speed relative to ground, I estimate a segment distance of travel of 500 feet.  During that distance it traveled that distance in about 1 minute.  To estimate the size of the UFO, I would compare it to holding in my out stretched something 1.5\"x3.0\" in size in my hand.  As far as I know I was the only one to see it.  Comment: Over the years I often wondered if it were nothing more than a plastic sheet floating along.  But anyone experienced in kite flying would know that any flat plastic sheet would not stay aloft parallel to the earth indefinitely as this object.  I felt when watching it as if it were a hole in the sky.  Almost as if I and the homes were being observed.  I was never frightened.

My last sighting was two years ago in 2004 in New Jersey.   This sighting occured in Washington, D.C. in April of 2006.  I was at a friend's house and the three of us decided to go outside on the apartment balcony and smoke a cigarette.   While we were out there I saw small flying aircrafts that were flashing red lights.  It reminded me of my sighting two years ago and brought back memories.  I realized it was the same objects.  I recognized the speed of the red flashing objects.   Again, my friends being very skeptical just assumed they were airplanes but not me.  No way, this is the second time that these objects came around.  This time in Washington, D.C.  They moved the same way in all types of directions.   The flying objects disappared after a short time, maybe 10 minutes.  Then after that I saw other aircrafts which looked like helicopters with spot lights just like my first sighting flying around the area.   We didn't stick around to see the helicopters fly around but they were gone after 30 minutes.  Again I  assume it is a UFO or something government related.  Especially since it happened in Washington, D.C.   You never really know with the government.   I don't know if they were any other outside witnesses but I have done some research online and have seen some forums with other witnesses of the same event.  I just decided to report this stuff since it was my second sighting of the same thing but in different states. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It would be best described as silver, cylindrical, shaped like a cigar tube.  No Windows, Wings, Identifyable Marks or Propulsion source.   It was half way between our plane and the ground.  Taking into account the speed our plane was travelling, the object was either hovering or moving very slow in a South West direction along a parallel flight path with the ground.  No erratic movement noted.  I was on a Continental Airline flight. The plane departed at 7AM from West Palm Beach, FL, en route to Newark, NJ.  We landed in Newark at about 9:30 AM.  I have never witnessed an unusual object such as this before. The sighting lasted approximately 30 seconds.  There was not time enough to get the attention of anyone else on the plane.  The object appeared to be slightly less than half distance between our plane and the ground.  I understand commercial aircraft generally travel at 35,000 feet, if this is the case, it would be my estimate that the object was located at about 17,000 feet.   Visability was perfectly clear. There were no clouds anywhere.  I cannot provide a comparison of the object to the sun, since my line of view was from above the object looking downward. I struggle to comprehend the actual size of the witnessed object.  It was large enough that it was clear and distinct but otherwise small from my point of view.  In comparison to objects on the ground, it was bigger than the size of a large house on the ground.

However, the camera is pointed generally to the east, and no airliners are in that part of the sky near the Capitol.

A fireball streaking high overhead from south to north, it was a DAYTIME SIGHTING, the persistent long tail was bright color of electric- arc blue mixed with violet- the color and brightness appearing like lightning from this witness' perspective, the head of the object grew larger as it moved from my right to left high in the sky, directly over the U.S. Capitol and behind the speaker's stage- I was located in the Mall between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, facing east, standing almost directly in front of the speakers stage about 100 feet back when I saw this object streak overhead  about half- way through the scheduled speakers presentations. I was awed and blown away for quite a while, and I wondered whether anybody else in the crowd witnessed this !  I was initially frightened by the streak or dart of light I saw in the sky over Capitol Hill- I thought at first a big firework, then I saw how high up it was- thousands of feet, or several miles- and then I thought missile, and the fireball got somewhat larger as it traveled, -and I actually expected an explosion with sound- but only silence happened, and the tail faded without leaving any smoke or cloud whatsoever. The tail of a normal meteor would have left a thin remnant smoke or cloud trail like a contrail- but I repeatedly sought for a wisp of smoke to try to understand what I was seeing- and saw only CLEAR BLUE SKY AND SUN- BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER ! AND my early impression is this was LIKE AN ARROW ! Why ? Because the tail was very long and persisted way too long to be a normal meteor. You see, a normal meteor is colored incandescent white or bright sun- yellow, with a short tail because the tail tracks closely to the head of the meteor ( look at videos of the unfortunate shuttle reentry loss ). But THIS object- the tail continued for at least 20 degrees of sky, the entire display faded all at once, and the color of the tail was electric- arc blue- like an arc welder, but deeper blue- fringed with violet- FULL LENGTH- and I think the head of the object, as it progressed and grew bigger, was more violet than blue. Moving south to north, from the direction of the sun towards north.  I turned and looked at the faces of the crowd together with the media risers close behind me- NO REACTION AT ALL ! That really bothered me, too !",

      "story": "Two fighter airplanes, assigned to inspect a white-dot cluster, suddenly disappear off radar, and then the cluster also disappears. Unusual UFO recording at Project Blue Book  In 1955, as part of a publishing team from Bantam Books who had published a book on UFO's, I was invited to the \"inner sanctuary\" of Project Blue Book. We were shown many interesting photos, but the most stunning experience came from a radar recording.  A radar record showed a number of white dots moving in formation high in the sky over Washington, D.C. Then two fighter airplanes were ordered up to investigate. We watched as they approached closer and closer to the cluster of about 5 or 6 white lights.  Suddenly, the radar dots of the planes disappeared. Then, in just a few seconds, the white-lights cluster suddenly moved upward at great speed, and quickly disappeared off of radar altogether.  We sat there in stunned silence--and then the questions and unhappy answers.  No, the planes and the pilots were never found. No wreckage. Only conclusion possible: they had been captured by the UFO's, pilots and planes, in toto.  No, the relatives were not told the truth. They had been told that the fighers had disappeared way out in the Atlantic Ocean.  And No--you cannot tell the truth, either.  You have been sworn to silence, and you must stick to that. Otherwise, you might stir up a hellish wave of panic.  That's it. Have never mentioned the event for the 53 years between then and 2008, when I thought it was finally time to reveal the event to Peter Davenport at the National UFO Reporting Center, in Seattle, Washington.

      "story": "elongated ad flattened 6 inch dome, with 1 bright light, hovers and darts like dragonfly, D.C. Mall, 7-4-97 I've decided that I should finally share something that I and my then-girlfriend saw over 10 years ago.  This seems to be the best place to do it.  I do not expect it to be taken tremendously seriously, as there are some details I've frankly just forgotten, and it is far from what you hear most UFO reports sounding like, but perhaps it's something to add to your database which could be correlated to other incidents.  I've only recently become deeply interested in this event again, sparked by a discussion with a friend, but I know that it has, in a way, always been in the back of my mind, for over 10 years now. Brought to the fore every time there was some report or show on TV, or a tabloid headline having to do with UFO's.  I do not expect a response to this, though it would be interesting to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like what I describe. First of all, about me:  My name is, let's say \"Mike\".  (I have no trouble giving my true details privately.)  I'm 37 years old, educated, and most would say intelligent. I practiced law for 4 years, now write flight simulation software, and will next year begin teaching high-school mathematics.  My hobbies have included things such as aviation, reading classic literature and about physics, plus even a bit of dabbling in astronomy.  (Just enough to appreciate the TREMENDOUS distances to even the nearest stars... which in my mind would make interstellar travel nearly impossible, at least under physics as we know it.  This is one of the reasons I'm so skeptical and have had real internal conflict over what I saw.)  By the way, I do not have a pilot's license, but do know quite a bit about aviation, theory of flight and such.  With a background such as this, and a mind-set skewed towards logic and science and technology, it's probably no surprise that I'm generally a very skeptical, evidence-oriented person. I frankly view a large part of the UFO \"movement\" or whatever it's called as comprised of people who just WANT to believe something -- followers, in a sense, of their own religion, in that many seem as eager to bypass reason and rationality as do the fundamentalists of the traditional religions. I add this only to point out that there really isn't a large part of me that is *eager* to believe this... to believe what I probably must believe if I accept the reality of what she (my girlfriend \"Lori\") and I saw. I think I now am starting to... hence this e-mail, 12 years later. My \"sighting\":  First, I'm actually not certain that this happened in 1997.  Lori and I are no longer together but still talk about this, and we're only 80 percent sure it was '97.  It may have been '96.  Regardless, it was the night of July 4th, and we had been to the National Mall in Washington D.C. to view the fireworks.  We each lived in the northwest suburbs of D.C., so had taken the metro (rail) from Gaithersburg directly down to the mall. (Red line to Orange line.)  We were there all day, watched the fireworks, and in general had a great time. We did not consume any alcohol, as we rarely drank, nor did we take any drugs.  The fireworks had ended.  We were tired and ready to go home. It was around 11 o'clock, I believe.  The crowd there was huge, obviously, so she and I had waited a bit for it to thin out instead of trying to sardine ourselves onto one of the metro train cars. So we started walking (I remember it as we were walking west, on the north side of the mall), and were heading towards the Nat'l Mall entrance to the Smithsonian Metro station.  We were not far at all from this entrance, certainly within 100 feet.  Then, from nowhere, this... \"thing\".. appeared. Carmel and I have always referred to it as the \"dragonfly UFO.\" It was on our left, slightly above eye-level -- no more than 10 feet high -- and I'm certain it was within 15 feet of us the whole time, at several moments probably less than half that. This thing was the size of a large dragonfly, I would say around 6 inches, and it flew and hovered the way a dragonfly might... just with MUCH more quick and abrupt movements. Like gravity and inertia didn't mater to it. It would be hovering, and then a handful of seconds later, in what seemed like an instant, it would zip over and be hovering several feet away in a new spot. We were walking while this was all happening, mouths agape I'm sure and staring, but afraid to stop I guess because of the main light's striking brightness. It did seem like it was paying attention to us (I can't believe I'm saying this, but like it was \"scanning\" us), so, during the probably 30 second period this all lasted, we saw this zipping around movement I described several times. It was so astounding. How that made us feel is complicated. In fact, I can only speak for myself. I just know that as this was happening, a few times I glanced quickly around to see if others were seeing this too. There were people around, so I suppose I felt a little bit of the whole \"safety in numbers\" thing. On the other hand, it did seem to stay near us, and we saw its light from the brightest aspect angles, I assume, so it did seem like we were being evaluated somehow. Combine that with the fact that this thing does NOT, truly, seem to be anything that would come from this Earth, and yes, there's a level of fear that mixes in. So all in all, I personally was a little scared, VERY amazed by what it could do, and frankly felt somewhat entertained by it (to the point that I was laughing... as if I knew then I'd never see such a spectacular show again.)  Sound.... This thing made no sound whatsoever. (Even considering the background noise, which is actually not as much as you'd might imagine that time of night on the Nat'l Mall, I feel confident that, given this thing's proximity to us at times, we should have heard something.) \"Lori\" agreed with this: if there were anything to hear, we would've. This \"dragonfly\" SEEMED to be slightly illuminated, but perhaps was just so shiny that it was reflecting the background light. I'm honestly not sure. It was hard to see past its \"main\" light. This was a very bright yellowish light, facing forward, from the \"head\"... though it struck me that calling that direction \"forward\" was somewhat arbitrary... and I really only could call it the head because that's where the light was. But this main light didn't show up as a beam, despite its intensity.  Again, maybe because there was a fair amount of background light in the area. What I did make out past of the object past that bright light could be best described as a very elongated computer mouse -- a flatter bottom, more rounded top, and length that was probably 3 - 4 times its width. Height was maybe half its width. All edges were rounded... nothing sharp. By FAR the most interesting feature of this miracle dragonfly was that there seemed to be two small spherical \"wings\" to it. But it wasn't like the blurry whirlwind you'd see when a humming bird or dragonfly are moving their wings very rapidly. It was more like a slightly yellow luminescent haze. Kind of like when you can see the heat rising from the asphalt on a hot summer day, but this was more intense than that. Somehow more turbulent or \"wigglier.\" These circles, where dragonfly wings would've been, were not large. Maybe a couple of inches, probably slightly less (because they were less than 1/3 its length). But certainly they were not large enough, had it actually been the blur of wings, to support even the lightest weight imaginable for a \"body\" of that size... i.e., even though we refer to it as the dragonfly UFO, its \"yellow haze ball\" wings were not nearly as large, proportionately, as a dragonfly's. One thing striking to both \"Lori\" and I is that only one other person seemed to see what we were seeing, though there were probably a dozen people within a 30 - 40 foot diameter. It was a girl between 5 to 10 feet behind us, and who herself was several feet away from who I assume was her boyfriend. She and I just quickly glanced at each other, puzzled, amazed, after this thing flew away. Those parts I remember clearly. I think I may have said something like \"what the HELL was that,\" but I can't be sure that I wasn't just thinking it. I know she said nothing to me, but looked shocked and far too white for July in D.C.. As I said, this thing seemed to come out of nowhere. When it left, about 30 seconds later, it receded to our left (which I believe was south at that point, towards the Potomac), very rapidly, in a flat trajectory. No more than +5 degrees flight path. It was as if this thing had instantly decided to go monitor someone else a mile away. The speed at which it left I'd say was 80 to 100 miles per hour. But I could not keep it in sight for long, and don't know if it sped up after that, or where it went. And it reached that 80 - 100 mph speed very, very quickly... as I look at the second hand of my computer clock and replay this in my mind, I'd say just a bit over a second. 1.25 +/- . But you have to understand that this thing was not so easy to see unless the main light was visible to you, and near the end it was not visible to us. You could track it if you HAD seen the main light, and then it turned and maneuvered, but with the way it blended with everything else, pulling in and reflecting, almost duplicating the visual surroundings, I doubt that someone who wasn't in the path of the main light would have noticed it at all. I remember this very clearly: this object did not have to yaw or turn so that it was facing the direction it wanted to fly, nor did it have to pitch its nose up as a typical helicopter would if it wanted to fly backwards. This stuck with me. Standard fixed or rotor wing flight principles are out of the question here. Jet and rocket engines make noise, of which this had none. Even the ion engine things I've seen are not equipped to power something in the way that we saw. Nuclear... sure, whatever. But these are power sources, not propulsion sources, and there is no physics text book in the land that could describe how something could move this way. You almost have to have seen it to believe it... those yellow luminescent \"wing\" spheres... the INSTANTANEOUS stopping and starting. No way. Skeptics may dismiss things like these as obvious hoaxes, but I'm telling you, neither I, nor my ex-girlfriend are idiots. I've tried for 12 years to find ways to convince myself it was some super secret CIA craft, but I just can't believe that. The principles behind this \"dragonfly\" just simply strike me as things which are thousands of years ahead of our technology. I have never heard of UFO sightings such as this, with a small craft doing dragonfly-like darting maneuvers. But I can tell you that \"Lori\" and I discussed this incident many times, and there was always an element of disbelief in those conversations. I'm not sure either of us ever said this explicitly (maybe because of fear of ridicule by the other... because we're intelligent, rational people, right?), but I'm pretty sure there was an unspoken understanding between us that this \"thing\" was not built by man. Yet it was definitely intelligently controlled. The conclusion is one I've avoided, but which is obvious.... I've attached a very rudimentary bitmap. I'm not much with any of those paint programs, but it gives you a pretty close idea. However, as I look at what I \"drew,\" it seems to me that the length should be still longer. Still 6 inches, but the other sides adjusted proportionally down, so that the whole thing would appear longer and thinner, a super fat cigar, almost. By the way, I should tell you, I admire the work your organization is doing, and believe, given what I've seen, and given what it seems others have seen, that your hard work will be validated and highly appreciated within the next 50 years.

But even though this was 13 years ago, I remember it vividly.  It has never left me, just for some reason started to think more and more about it lately. There was a small group of us over at a friend\u2019s house, planning to spend the night.  As the evening was winding down, a few of us stepped outside for some fresh air.  After a bit of time the other individuals with me decided to go inside, but for some reason I thought I\u2019d just stay out there a little longer. I remember looking straight up at the sky, and marveling at the fact that it was so clear.  There were tons of stars out.  As I was looking up at the stars, something caught my eye.  At first it had blended in with the rest of the stars, but I soon realized that there were a set of white lights moving with each other, slightly rotating.  (Since the object was high up in the sky and it was dark out, the lights were the only thing I really saw).  At this point, the lights appeared as if they were in a triangle formation, equi-distant from each other.   The object remained in the same point of the sky, but started to \u2018revolve\u2019 around it\u2019s vertical axis.   This is when I started to realize that it was a 3D object.    As the triangle shaped set of lights began to rotate at a moderate speed, the triangular plane created by those lights became slanted until I was looking at the very edge of the triangle (for a split second I just saw a line of lights).  As it continued to rotate, the! triangular plane appeared again as if viewing it from the other side.   All this was happening on/near it\u2019s vertical axis, but the entire object start to revolve around the horizontal axis as well.   As it continued to revolve it began moving slowly across the sky.   After moving at that speed for  a bit, it sped up considerably until it was out of sight in a matter of seconds.  It traveled a long distance in a very short amount of time. As I was watching this, I remember feeling that this object was way up in the sky, and very large.  My setting was almost void of any sound, and this craft did not add to it at all, there was no sound (but it took me a bit to realize this, since it was so odd).  I also thought the lights must have been very bright considering the fact they were competing with stars from my original vantage point.   I couldn\u2019t believe what I had seen, and was/am sure it was from another world. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

It appeared to be cylindrical in shape and dark, gray maybe or a dull metallic color; it was relatively well offset by the colors of the evening sky so it was plainly visible to the naked eye.  It seemed to be fairly large and distant; it stayed completely stationary for some time.  After I first noticed it I didn\u2019t point it out until I realized that it had not moved at all for close to 30 sec.  I pointed it out to my 4 friends who all saw I but we could not decided what it was, the general consensus seemed to be that it might be a kite of some sort but to me it seemed too high in the sky and large, also the area of the sky it was in did not see like a place where anyone would fly a kite of any sort.  I pulled out my cell phone to take a picture the clouds behind the object could be seen on the screen the but object did not appear despite that fact that as I mentioned before it was plainly visible to the naked eye, a fact that I pointed out to my friends, and all of my group saw it.  If I recall I also heard someone in another group we passed mention noticing it.  The object remained stationary for several minutes thereafter until it moved slightly down and to the right and from view. \tThe object was perhaps 30 to 40 degrees in the sky to the WNW, generally in the area of the sky between the Washington monument and the White House but probably more distant.  It particularly struck me as odd because this is not a residential area, and as far as I know restricted air space, also this is the area of the sky were aircraft approach Regan National airport.",

      "story": "Small spinning circular shaped object passes between houses but doesn't come down. My friend and I, ages approximately 9 and 10 years old, were playing catch with a baseball in his back yard on a bright sunny warm morning in June, approximately 1966, when what I perceived to be a boomarang came between his house and the neighbors house.  It was about 2 feet in diameter and between 15 and 20 feet off the ground traveling south when I saw it coming from behind my friend. I immediately yelled,\"look a boomarang, lets catch it.\"  He looked up and saw it and we both waited for it to come down but it continued traveling on a straight steady course and did not come down as we expected it to. We ran and grabbed our sling shots and ran after it.  We ran into a large open field behind his house and watched it as it traveled over a tree, which was in the yard of a house about 1 block away.  We knew that a large woods was immediaately behind that house and so we ran across the open field to the woods and then ran about 1 mile through the woods to find out if we could still see the object.  We peered out over what was then a city trash dump but could no longer see the object.  It was traveling at about 10 miles per hour when it came between the houses and made no noise what so ever.  The object guided itself to pass immediately over the tree of the house which was one block away.  The object looked to me like a boomarang spinning so fast as to appear as a solid disc, but it may have actually been solid, I don't know.  I chose to classify it as circular instead of disc because I don't believe it was very thick at all.  My friend still remembers this event today, which is at least 42 years later.   This may have occured in either 1965, 1966 or 1967. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

      "story": "Daytime sighting of bright light changing to stationary white/blue gray annulus and then moved very fast. Weather: Temperature (est) upper 80s/low 90s), humidity (dew point 60s), wind light, clear sky with patch of high level cirrus to north east.  Air craft contrails moderate to short with definite gaps in trail. Narrative: I was sitting on a lounge chair located in the patio shade attempting to read a novel as I played with my granddaughter and a neighbor\u2019s child.  They were interested in how the chair could change positions as I relaxed so they were tilting me to and fro.  My grandson was off exploring around the corner of the house. I observed a contrail passing from North to South as an aircraft flew along the usual flight path to the west of Washington.  This contrail was short to moderate in length as it evaporated into the dry upper-level air.  The next aircraft observed along that path did not pass until after 1700 hours.  Length of contrails depends upon humidity level of the surrounding air and there were definite long gaps in these contrails. As I looked at the contrail and the aircraft started to disappear behind a nearby tree, my attention was drawn to a bright light very slightly above the contrail.  I assumed this light to be caused by the sun reflecting from another aircraft.  As I looked at the light source, its position in the sky relative to the contrail did not change.  Thus it could not have been caused by reflection from another aircraft. Nor could it have been caused by reflection from a satellite.  Both sources would have moved relative to the contrail. Shortly the apparent position relative to the still existing contrail changed from above to below the contrail.  Time for this change from the initial was estimated in the neighborhood of 30 to 60 seconds.  I noted that the light was now an object that appeared to be similar to a high flying balloon such as those used for upper air studies.  So my next guess at the cause of the bright light that I first noticed was a reflection from the instrument package.  Thus I arose from my lounge chair to call my grandchildren so that I could show them the balloon. The object now appeared against the blue sky background as a white/blue-gray annulus with a darker blue-gray center. It was much larger than the original light source.  Relative size can be compared to that of a pea (3-5 mm) held at arms\u2019 length.  From my viewing angle I assumed that it was a round object with a flat bottom since it appeared elliptical.  Color and shading was consistent with light shining through, not reflecting from, a high flying polyethylene balloon.  Brightness was similar to that of the moon which was in the eastern sky on that day.  The moon in the southern sky was hidden from my view by the roof of the home. I continued to view the object as it moved quite quickly for a short (relative) distance and stopped.  Upon this movement, I started to think that perhaps the object was much closer to me and that it could be some type of air borne seed (such as cottonwood) or debris moved about by low level winds swirling around the house.  Second thoughts occurred as I changed my position relative to nearby houses and trees.  This object had moved too fast for wind born insects, seeds or debris. As I continued to observe the object, it very suddenly accelerated and sped off eastward passing across my field of view from west to east behind the nearby rooftop in well under one second.  Total subtended angle of movement before moving out of my sight was in the 20 degree range.  No contrail or other evidence of its passing remained except the image in my minds eye. Altitude of this object cannot be estimated from this single observation since the size of this object is unknown.  Estimated angle above the horizon at first sighting is around 40 degrees.  The apparent standing still with respect to the contrail can be explained by the initial movement of the object directly toward me.  The object would have moved closer to me and toward the north as it descended below my reference contrail and become a recognizable shape.  From my viewing angle, the object was probably circular giving it somewhat of an elliptical \"cigar\" shape popularized by other UFO reports.  It moved too fast across my field of view to describe it better.  Total viewing time was 1.5 to 3 minutes.   This is estimated from my first sighting to my subsequent moving about to locate my grandchildren.  I certainly did not look at my watch during this event.

      "story": "I saw a silver metallic ball fly over my house in Wash., D.C. in broad daylight! On the morning of July 28, 2010 at 10:00am I was sitting in my back yard contemplating a conversation my son and I had then night before. It was a crystal clear, beautiful morning with very few clouds.  I looked up and saw approaching from the west in an easterly direction, a silver metallic ball slowly approaching.  It was as low in the sky as any commercial airplane is allowed in and over Washington D.C. Amazed, my first thought was to call my family, however, they were still asleep and I feared it would be gone by the time I got back.  I considered grabbing my camera but decided against it for the same reason.  As I sat gazing at this clearly visible metallic ball, I realized I had my cell phone on me. Unfortunately, my cell phone camera only works when I don\u2019t want it to and as I attempted to photograph the object,  I couldn\u2019t get it to work, to my frustration. It was probably due to nervousness.  The object was visible for at least 30 seconds and then when it was directly above my head,  it disappeared.  It didn\u2019t zoom off or fly away, it disappeared!  The only reason I know it was 10:00 exactly is because after it disappeared my phone clock said 10:01am.  This is real!  It was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen, perfectly round, reflecting the sun on the side that was nearest the sunlight.  I know what I saw. It was real.  If I\u2019m lying I pray my children drop dead now.  Something is going on in the nation\u2019s capitol!",

      "story": "Large white craft seen on 1-70W during morning traffic On Saturday, August 21, 2010, I was driving to Wheeling, WV to attend a wedding.  At around 10:45AM, while approaching Washington, PA on I-70W, a large object in the northern sky caught my attention.  Since there was a bit of traffic and I was driving relatively slowly, I was able to observe the object for approximately 45 seconds. The first instant I saw it, I thought it must have been a very large, low flying jet of some sort, but further observation ruled that out.  The object was long, thin, tapered at each end, with a somewhat thicker section in the middle of the craft. It was a solid white in color and was flying at about 8 inches (visually) above the treeline.  It was at least five inches long at arm's length from end to end, and maybe about an inch maximum from top to bottom at the thickest part. Again, it appeared to be very large.  I could see that it was definitely gliding toward my general direction at a steady speed.  I could not distinguish the exact! shape of the craft as I was looking at an approaching object dead-on. In my opinion, it was probably a large disk or chevron-shaped craft.  There was no sound and I saw no contrail. It was very startling due to the size and nature of the object.  It was unlike anything I am familiar with seeing in the sky.  I was unable to see where it went after I drove past it. I know for a fact that several other people had the chance to see this object, as there were many vehicles on the road at the time, the object was quite noticeable, and traffic was moving relatively slowly.  I'm extremely curious to see if another witness might read this report and come forward with their own account.  Perhaps someone at a different vantage point was able to get a better view of the shape of the object.",

We reside in a high rise building and lost sight of the object after about 2 minutes as it travelled over our building.   I was able to go onto the patio of our residence and could not hear any sound coming from the object.  It was moving at a pace consistent with air traffic , but was outside of the normal areas where we have previously seen air traffic and had no flashing lights that one would expect to see on a traditional aircraft.   The object was at an altitude that I would estimate at between 2,000 to 3,000 feet and appeared to be travelling parallel to the ground, not increasing or decreasing in altitude.  The object appeared similar to a rocket, although all that I was able to make out was the flame.  The flame was distinctly red and lacked the white or yellow colorations that I have seen when observing several shuttle launches! .   The object was heading towards the Potomac Maryland area.  The object was flying in a straight path. I am a financial services executive and have never previously reporting anything of this nature.  Given the security parameters in place in the Washington DC area, I would hope that someone would have information on this object.   I am reporting it in hopes that someone can provide me with an explanation of what this very unusual object was.  It was flying low enough that it should have emitted some type of sound and I was amazed that I could hear no noise at all.   Also the red coloration was very unusual.

It probably only took me 30 or 40 seconds to take the first 5 or 6 photos because the rocks were hurting my feet and I wanted to get down to the pool deck where I took about two more.  I showed my wife and she thought I might have had something on the lens. If I did it came off quick because the last four photos do not show the object.  I zoomed in on ! the photos to see if I could detect a shape. Two looked oval and the other two appeared to have a saucer shape.

      "story": "elongated and flattened 6\"dome,\" with 1 bright light, hovers and darts like dragonfly, D.C. Mall, July 4th 1997 I've decided that I should finally share something that I and my friend and at least one other person saw over 10 years ago. It's something to add to your database so that it could perhaps be correlated to other incidents.  Please note that I'm actually not certain that this happened on Independence Day 1997; it may have been Independence Day of 1996.  But my friend and I have talked about this event many times since then, and we're 80 percent sure it was 1997. I'm a D.C. metro area educated professional, in my mid 30's. I've long been interested in both aviation and astronomy, and know quite a bit about each.   I'm generally a very skeptical, practical and evidence-oriented person, and until the moment of this sighting, I would not have given the UFO topic the time of day.  But there were multiple witnesses to this event, so I can't simply dismiss it, and yet I also can't explain it in any conventional way. My friend and I had been to the National Mall in Washington D.C. to view the 4th of July fireworks. We had taken the Metro rail into the city, were there at The Mall all day, watched the fireworks, and they had recently ended.  We had not consumed any alcohol. The crowd there had been huge, obviously, so we waited a bit for the masses of people to thin out instead of trying to sardine ourselves onto a Metro car.  This incident therefore must've occurred around 11p.m. We were walking on the Mall on the eastern side of Washington Monument, headed west, toward the northern-most entrance to the Smithsonian Metro station.  We were not far at all from the entrance, certainly within 100 feet, when we first saw this small object.  We have always referred to it as the \"dragonfly UFO\"  (Googling that phrase now, I see it has its own meaning in UFO circles.  But what we saw looked nothing like that infamous hoax.)   This object was to our left, slightly above eye-level, and I'm certain it was within 15 feet of us for this 30-second duration, and at several moments probably less than half that distance.  It was about 6 inches at its longest, and it darted and hovered the way a dragonfly or hummingbird might, with extremely quick and abrupt stops and starts. Like gravity and inertia were barely an inconvenience.  It would be hovering for a handful of seconds, and then in almost an instant it would zip over and be hovering several feet away.  We saw this particular movement probably 5 or 6 times.  The object was definitely intelligently controlled, as it seemed interested in the people in the area. It made no sound whatsoever, and given this thing's proximity to us we should have heard something. (Even considering the background noise.) It was just astounding to see. The object consisted of two main parts: a very bright main light up above, and underneath that a handful of inches was a slightly illuminated, metallic-looking dome.  Like a slightly flattened and elongated top half of a softball.  But I'm less certain of that aspect, since it was hard to see past the object's upper main light.  That light was a very bright, with a yellowish and brilliant glow, facing forward from what I perceived to be the object's front. The most interesting feature of this object, to me -- what I could see since it was slightly lower than the 'body' (itself below the main light) -- was that there seemed to be two small, slightly yellow and luminescent areas of \"haze\" underneath the central area, the area where wings should've been. This haze reminded me of the heat that rises a few inches from black asphalt on a hot summer day, but it was more intense and turbulent -- finer, in a sense.  These hazy areas were basically spherical and not very large -- maybe 2 or 3 inches -- sitting just below the body. When the object left, about 30 seconds after we first saw it, it flew towards our front left (south to southwest) very rapidly, and in a basically flat trajectory.  This would be towards what is now the Whitten Building.  It left at a speed of probably 80-100 mph, but it reached this speed very quickly, in only a second or maybe slightly more.  And one thing I specifically remember extremely clearly is that this object, when hovering and darting, did not have to yaw or turn in any way to accommodate the direction in which it was about to fly.  Knowing aviation as I do, this struck me as particularly odd. So, standard fixed- or rotor-wing flight principles were not at work here.  They just weren't.   This object clearly was not flying aerodynamically, or based on standard lift, and yet I'm confident it was intelligently controlled.  Its near instantaneous stopping and starting, the lack of sound, the unique brilliance of the top light... it was amazing.  As strange as it sounds and as! hard as it has been for me to come to terms with, I simply cannot imagine that this object was manufactured by humans. I know that many people had to have seen this object that night. I'm amazed that I've not been able to find any similar reports.

If I had thought to check this site then, I would have reported sooner. UFO's aren't my thing but this was darned odd. I am a technology professional. I don't have time for UFO's and little green men.  About 45 minutes before fireworks were due to begin, my wife, my two kids and I were out in the front yard playing and waiting for darkness to fall so we could watch the fireworks our town puts on every year. Our yard has a spacious view of the skies to the north and west. As my infant son played in the bed of my pickup truck, I was intrigued when I noticed a single, bright ball of light moving very slowly southward from the distance in the northern sky. It took several minutes for the light to reach our position but slightly west of us. As it came closer, it almost seemed as if it was made of fire, like a campfire moving through sky?! Since there were no clouds, I was unable to determine any kind of altitude. As I watched it continue to move southward, it seemed to slowly fade out and disappear completely. I could see the lights and vapor trails of airplanes higher up but not this object.  As fascinating as that object was, I was completely astounded when I witnessed five more objects, traveling nearly the same trajectory, one by one in succession, cross the evening sky in the same general direction, that is, north to south. The last object traveled out of the north, moving directly south and ended up to the east of our position. They all took approximately 5 to 7 minutes to traverse the sky.  My first thought was that these were some kind of rocket tests as we are near Crane Naval Weapons Station. But I never found any news articles stating that there would be tests. I eliminated the possibility of chinese lanterns simply because of their trajectory. I didn't have a video capture device at the time so I was unable to get footage.  One idea I had was to look back and see what the wind patterns were on that night, but I am unable to find any data on this.  I hope this information is helpful to someone.",

I was passing a school located at Rhode Island Ave. & Q St. NW.  Coming from behind the school, I saw a bright light high up in the sky moving south to north.  At first it looked like an airplane because it was moving in a slow, slight line.  But the more I looked at it the less it looked like an airplane.  The light had an orange color to it and was getting brighter and then dimmer over and over again.  As it passed overhead, it started to dim and then finally disappeared altogether. Right before the light disappeared, another light came from behind the same school.  This second light was completely identical to the first in its flight path, speed and quality of the color.  It also dimmed and then disappeared at the same place in the sky as the first one did.  It\u2019s difficult to estimate how far each one traveled as I watched them.  But they were far up in the sky so they easily could have covered 1,000 feet of distance. Neither of these objects made any noise.  For a second I thought they might have been helicopters because I heard a helicopter motor just as the second one was disappearing.  But then I realized that they weren\u2019t because the helicopter noise was coming from behind the school (the south \u2013 where the object had just come from).  In fact I briefly saw the lights of the helicopter come from behind the school to confirm what I was thinking.  It didn\u2019t follow the flight path of the lights as far as I could tell. I continued to walk and got to my street within about 10 minutes.  As I was walking down my street, I looked back in the general area in the sky where I had seen the two lights.  To my surprise I saw a third object that was completely different than the first two.  While the first two objects were high up like an airplane, this object was lower, about the height of a low flying helicopter.  It was moving in a straight line from south to north.  It\u2019s difficult to describe its appearance because it had no discernible features.  If you can imagine a large plastic grocery bag (about the size of an SUV) flying through the air and changing shape in the wind, that\u2019s how it looked.  Unlike the first two objects, it didn\u2019t have any kind of light to it.  It was a white object that was visible due to the ambient light of the city.  It made no noise even though it was not too far over the rooftops.  I watched it travel for about 500 feet until the trees of my neighborhood obscured my vi! ew.",

I was sitting on the deck with my friend and about 60 yards away in the distance we saw glowing objects flying right above a 2 story house in front of the chimney.  From what I could tell, they were round, or spherical objects that could change their size.  At the very least they would appear to be the size of a firefly but much brighter, and at times the objects would appear to grow to the size of a navel orange, but then shrink and disappear.  I watched these objects fly around for about 15 minutes. I walked away for 10 minutes then returned and the objects were still there.  On Friday August 10, 2012 at approximately 3 AM I witnessed the objects again, they were flying around in the same place as before.  This time I had binoculars and with getting a closer look!  I was able to detect that they were not fireflies.  They seemed to maneuver like moths, in a rather erratic fashion.  But they did not have wings.  One of the objects which was about the size of a ping pong ball flew in a corkscrew maneuver within what seemed like an area of 2 feet or so.   All of the objects flew within an area of about 3 feet, I did not witness the objects flying away from the area in front of the chimney.

Its altitude appeared to be that of small private aircraft.  It could not have been as high as commercial jets because had it been, its speed would have been so great that we would have experienced a sonic boom.  It was moving moderately quickly, I estimate at 200 mph.  What was most interesting is that there was no sound! from it!  We both are adults, an engineer and a teacher.  We\u2019ve seen many things in the night sky:  aircraft, spacecraft (ISS, Iridium Flares, etc).  Never anything like this.",

I also made a report last night, about 30 minutes after seeing this, to a site called UFOSNM. Today is Monday Jan 30th 2012. Description: I live in Washington DC. Moving almost exactly from east to west (I have checked the direction on google earth) at about 7:20 pm today (01/29/12) I saw a large group of round white lights, maybe 10 or 12 of them, seemingly apart from each other, in a group, moving far too quickly to be plane/jet/etc.  Although the lights moved around each other at a very fast rate, the group traveled in a straight line  It looked like each white light was moving around each other in a pattern.  Somewhat like bees do around a hive.  I have no idea what this was but what I do know is it was not like anything that I have ever seen before.  I should add that this could NOT be any aircraft known. This close group of revolving/moving lights moved across the entire sky in approximately 10 seconds.  Fantastic, whatever it was.  I might also add that I have never made any such report before.*other than note above. The sky was clear at this time.  No way to determine altitude.  I watched this \u2018group of lights\u2019 until they reached the horizon and faded out. The reason for me making this report is that,  1/ Being the nation\u2019s capitol, I think that this should be looked into. 2/ I would like to find out if there was any other report of what I saw, seeing that we have so many aircraft in this area.

      "story": "Glowing Orb/ Fireball This past 4th of July, 2013, my family and I had gone to go watch the community fireworks show at the local middle school.  We arrived at the field around 8:30pm.  It was still light out and there were already hundreds of people gathered in the field.  We were there for maybe about 15-20 minutes watching the kids run around catching fireflies and I was setting up my camera getting ready for the show.  I have a Cannon Rebel T3i with a 55mm-250mm telephoto lens and was playing with the settings to get the best fireworks shots I could. My youngest son who is 5 years old saw something in the sky and told us all to turn and look at it.  He thought it was a balloon.  When I turned to look at it I knew right away that it was no balloon.  It appeared to be some sort of glowing orb.  It was so bright at the center that it appeared bright white and had an orange glow around that.  As an avid photographer I had taken many photographs of balloons and knew right away this was different.  It was traveling horizontally across the sky about the speed of a commercial passenger plane. It moved very smoothly and silently.  It was probably flying around 15000 to 20000 feet based off where most planes fly.  It maintained its speed and altitude as it crossed the sky.   Soon after my son pointed it out to us I began to hear others around the field taking notice and asking what it was as well.  Everyone was looking and pointing at the object as it hovered across the sky.  It traveled about three quarter of the way across the sky before it! disappeared. In that time I managed to take two photos of the object.  I was so interested in watching it that I didn\u2019t take any more.  Shortly after the object disappeared from the sky a plane fly overhead seeming to follow the exact path the object took minutes before.  It moved at a very similar speed only there was apparent noise generated by the planes engines.   The plane also seemed to fly further across the sky than the object did getting smaller until it was no longer visible.  One of the photos I took had apparent distortion to the object from shaking the camera. The other was very clear.  Once I got home I was able to crop the photo and get a better look at the object. It appeared to have some sort of structure inside the \u201cglow\u201d.  As far as what it was I couldn\u2019t make that out.  No one in the field that night seemed to talk about it after it disappeared.  I kept a close eye on the news papers and news websites following the event to see if anyone else reported it or if there was any mention of what it was.  There were hundreds of witnesses that night but I have yet to hear anything from anybody as far as what they thought it was.",

He thought it was a hot air balloon.   When we turned to look at it there was no balloon or basket.  What we saw was a glowing orb. It was bright white at the center, yellow around the center and orange on the outside.  It was traveling from southwest to northeast.  It wasn't falling thru the sky, it appeared to be gaining in altitude.  It made no noise.   There were at least a couple hundred people there waiting for the fireworks to begin.  You could hear other people saying \"look at that\"  So I know we weren't the only ones who seen it.   As an avid photographer I had my camera ready to photograph the fireworks and was able to get 2 pictures of the object. I have a Canon T3i rebel camera with a 55mm-250mm zoom lens and was able to get a fairly clear photo of the object.   My girlfriend had been frightened by what we saw when we were observing it.  It traveled in a fairly straight path across the sky appearing to slighty gain altitude as it crossed overhead.  It traveled about three quarters across the sky above before it just disappeared.  About 15-20 minutes later a comercial plane passed over the field seemingly in the exact same path and at the same speed as the glowing object.  The plane had the traditional noise associated with a plane and flew until it was so small you couldn't see it anymore, farther than the object that passed before it but it was visably much less bright.   Once I was home and examined the photos I took, one had obvious shaking distortion to the object.   The other was clear and you could make out a longer cylindrical solid object in the center of the glow. Clearly nothing like any othe flying craft I had witnessed or anyone I've shown the photo to.   I'm positive that others there that night witnessed the same object.",

Noticing an orange glowing light in the night sky, we guessed at possibilities such as a helicopter with a searchlight, or a flare.  She briefly thought she heard a muffled helicopter type sound, but we were standing near an outside AC unit which also produces a hum.  We then took notice that outside of the orange light, we could make out no other lights on the object, which moved with what seemed like a controlled \"floating\" similar to that of a helicopter.  The brightness of the color varied but was always orange as it moved basically parallel and a few hundred feet above the tree line, until eventually disappearing.   Ruling out the flare theory, and assuming we had seen a helicopter equipped with searchlight, the darkness, or our angle of viewing causing the odd appearance, my employer leaves.  Three more fellow employees walk outside and as I'm filling them in, one points to what appears to be two, new, similar objects.  We watched for what I'd guess was around 15 minutes as they took a like path as that of the first object, but at various points seemed touch each other, fly in loose formation and be linked or connected(think one towing the other).  Again the constant orange color with varying stages of brightness.",

We live in Greenville, NC.  We were coming into Washington, NC when right above the tree-tops there was a flying object.  It was maybe 100-200ft up in the sky.  It was around 9:25PM and we watched it for a minute or less. It was flying from right to left.  It was something unbelievable.  At first we thought it was a plane but they have never and wouldn\u2019t fly that low over the Washington area.  We live by an airport and could learly tell it wasn\u2019t a plane.  It was cloudy tonight so if it was an airplane, we shouldn\u2019t have been able to see it. It appeared to be silver in color and was more oval or the typical \u201cUFO\u201d shape.  It was flying incredible fast, faster than any airplane I have ever seen.  It had lights that could have been underneath of it but they looked more along the sides and on the middle of the craft.  The lights were different colors of white, yellow, and red.  They didn't have a synchronized pattern in their flashes either and they all flashed at different times.  It seemed to have a reddish/orange vapor trail following. When it got toward the 1 minute mark it just seemed to vaporize and it was gone.  We can only believe that it was a UFO and it was amazing.",

During this last week of October we had Osprey aircraft performing exercises one of those day during the afternoon perhaps 4-5 pm.  The sound we heard from within our house while watching TV was not US military. The sound startled us because of the low persistent humming.  We spent a good 5 to 10 minutes in the street trying to locate the origin of this hum/vibration.  I can not remember if it ended or we just went back inside. Sorry it is not too terribly exciting.

Just as it was beginning to get dark I noticed some pulsing lights coming up from the direction south beyond Hawkins Creek within tree top level-(est. 600-700ft. away) from my slightly elevated position. I was already walking westerly and a short moment later it appeared that the formation of blinking lights, UFO's(12-15) were going to be slightly west of my location.  The HPS lights on the towers had just illuminated moments before and I'd only walked about 200 ft from the office building while passing under a light tower to get a better unobstructed view. They were in a loose single file formation, some slightly higher, lower, or farther and closer. They seemed very close to me without any sounds being noticed or heard.  Perspective wise they were maybe the size of a finger or thumbnail held out at arm's length. The illumintated craft were each pulsing unsynchronized, first two beats warm red colored light near the center bottom surface of the craft, then two beats of a rose color somewhat wider spread out further, then lastly two beats of a ruby red color illuminating the furthest across the bottom surface.  The light pattern would repeaton each craft again and again evenly about every 5-7 seconds to complete.  It wasn't entirely dark yet and I couldn't see anything on the topside.  It seemed that the larger ruby colored flashing beats best revealed the overall oval shape of the UFO. The UFO's were more visible to see farther away when approaching, because when I thought to start counting them, they were less visible and fading out fast at the front of the formation traveling away from me towards the northwest.  I thought maybe the event had ended when I turned around shortly before spotting 2-3 more of the same craft following the same flight path, spaced much farther apart, moving about the same speed, within about 20-30 seconds behind the main group.  The craft were not moving very fast and seemed very low and slow, maybe about 50-80 MPH, about 60 degrees above my horizon and less than a quarter of a mile away.  My location was about 500ft. above sea level.",

Lone orb 5 min later Myself and 6 other people were on a 9th floor rooftop in Washington D.C.'s Dupont Circle neighborhood at roughly 10:30 PM.  Something directly above me caught my eye.  I looked up to see 8 orbs of light flying silently in formation about 2000 yards up.  The orbs looked to resemble what we know as a plane.  Four orbs in a straight line with two orbs going out to each side and angled toward the back of the formation at the midway point of the 4 in-line orbs.  It was immediately evident that this was not a plane however as the clouds that were in the back ground (much higher in the sky) were clearly visible in the space between the orbs.  The orbs of light traveled in this formation for roughly 15 seconds going south to north.  At the 15 second mark the formation went through a synchronized \u201cdeformation scramble\u201d into an amorphous unidentifiable jumble (still retaining their individual properties just no longer in a geometric formation of any kind).  The mass of unorga! nized orbs accelerated not over the horizon but directly following our horizontal site line.  The lights then vanished completely at a height I can only describe as three fingers above the horizon (holding my hand out a foot in front of my face) and roughly 5 miles away. Five minutes later someone facing the south (I was facing north) said, \u201cLook another one.\u201d  I again looked immediately up to see a single orb of light, flying at the same altitude and in the same direction as the previous 8 orbs.  This one had a more defined haze of light surrounding it and was lighter/whiter in color.  At around the same distance as the deformation described in the previous paragraph, the single orb began to move laterally; from my view point no more than a 10-15 degree divergence from its northern flight path on either side.  Essentially it began to wiggle back and forth for 5 seconds as it continued its northern progression in the same direction as the previous 8.  The orb then disappeared in roughly the same spot as the ones prior.",

I live on the top of a big hill in DC that overlooks the Potomac river.  I was looking out my window towards the South East and over Virginia or the river, I saw a slow moving formation of lights.  Not unlike what I've seen of the \"Phoenix Lights.\"  I watched them for a little while 15-30 mins.  I took some photographs, which I will submit.   This view also encompasses the takeoff/landing path for Reagan National airport in Alexandria, VA, but I have been watching the planes come and go for a couple of years, and have never ever seen something like this.   The lights in the formation moved in inconsistent ways.  Some moving up and down some left (south) some right (north).  I went out to the street and could see them there as well.  I went in to get something to eat and when I returned they were gone.   Also to note, the lights were orange, not yellow or white.  I did see aircraft take off from the airport while the event was occurring and it appears the the lights were further off than the aircraft.",

Immediately upon pulling out of our store's parking lot, my attention was drawn to a bright orange light moving across the sky.  It was somewhat close to the Moon at first.  My eyes were glued to its position, because this was no plane or helicopter.  I could tell by its movement which was obviously free of any particular direction.   Then, after a few seconds, the light turned off as it swooped down at an incalculable speed. It flew directly over my car and I saw a grey, squared shaped craft with a dark circle on the bottom.  However, it was flying in the opposite direction from where I was driving, so I lost sight afterwords.

      "story": "5 \"Fire like\" lights seen slowly traveling northbound in the northern sky in a rectangular shape, but changed shape. To whom it may concern,   On Thursday evening, at about 10:10 pm, on April 10, 2014, I was a witness to an Unidentified Flying Object.  I was in the front yard of my house and saw movement in the sky toward the north of my house.  I observed 5 glowing yellow lights (almost like a flame, but not flickering) in a rectangular like formation. I immediately ran into my house and told my wife and 2 daughters that were home to come outside to look at the lights.  We all went out our back door of the house and I pointed to the area of the lights.  They all saw the same thing I saw, but it looked as if the lights began traveling northbound slowly.  One of the 5 lights looked as if it merger into one of the other lights. There were no sounds coming from the lights or anywhere else-other than the sound of neighbors talking (the sound travels in my backyard at night). At one point, I saw what looked like flashing lights of a small aircraft (green and red flashing light) was traveling from the east to west in a path going toward the lights.  As the flashing lights reached the far right side of the lights, the flashing lights disappeared.  The flashing red & green aircraft lights didn't change direction, didn't turn- they just disappeared. My wife ran back into the house to grab a camera to see if it would show up in a picture, so she thought to quickly grab her iPad mini.  She took several pictures, of which a couple clearly showed the lights of the object. After about 4-5 minutes, the lights appeared to continue traveling in a northern direction, then disappeared.  They object didn't make any sounds, but the lights just disappeared within a few seconds. We've not contacted anyone,or,organization about what we saw, other than a few friends at church who thought we were crazy.  I even sent an email to a doctor friend of mine who is a novice astronomer. I am a retired police officer, former Air Force Sergeant, who has never before seen anything like what we saw than night.  While I do believe in UFO's, I've never before seen anything that I would consider \"Unidentified\".  No one in my family consumes alcohol or recreational drugs. Please let me know if you would like any additional information or have any questions. Sincerely,  XXXXX",

THE OTHER SMALLER CRAFT WERE TOGETHER IN TWOS AND HOVERED IN THE SOUTH SKY BEFORE MOVING OUT INTO DEEP SPACE.",

      "story": "'Unidentified Ground Object' Spotted in Northwest, Washington, DC I was walking in my backyard towards my driveway when my cat, who was also in the backyard, suddenly froze staring at the base of a tree.  It then took a few steps backwards, turned around, and ran full speed to the door on the other side of the house (to be let back inside).  I looked around the tree to see what had frightened the cat, but there was nothing there, so I turned and took a few steps away, but decided to quickly look back one last time.  That's when I saw this object running from the tree to behind the trash barrels located near the end of the driveway.  It was about 12-15 ft. from me and in my direct line of sight on a bright, sunny day.  I was very startled, and decided to first let the cat back into the house.  A few minutes later I walked over to the trash barrels, but there was nothing there. The object appeared to 2 dimensional (like a geometrically shaped cardboard cutout), and it seemed able to camouflage itself (like a cuttlefish, or something I'd expect to be created in a DARPA lab).   The object\u2019s legs appeared to be moving rapidly, but it\u2019s movement was comparatively slow as if it wasn\u2019t getting good traction.  The object was approximately 18 inches tall.  It was shaped like a small black sphere with a pie shaped cutout (similar to the outline of an astronaut\u2019s helmet) over a black triangular shaped mid section, and a barely visible pair of legs below the mid section. I don't expect others to believe me, as I wouldn't believe such a story if it was told to me. Never-the-less, I\u2019ve reported what I had seen, because I couldn't attribute it to being a shadow, glare, or another rational explanation, and perhaps others also spotted it.

The small circular object first appeared to me as if it was a fixed object in the sky but upon further observation it was moving from right to left slowly at a far off distance.   My first impression was that it looked like a small moon--it was the same color as the moon in daylight.  But then I saw it glinted silver from the sun.   Again, it clearly pretty far away, so no other detail from the object could be seen (other than it appeared circular and was silver).   Although it was moving across the sky like a plane, it did not have a plane shape.  I obviously have seen many planes in the sky and this didn't look anything like that.   Also, there was no white trail or anything from the object to indicate it was a plane. It was bizarre.  I saw it for the entire time I was driving that direction on the road.   Once I made a turn, I couldn't look that way anymore.",

Each of the craft looked independent of the others but moved at pace as if connected. They looked like birds that were well lit from below, but didn't move like birds and being dark; not enough light to light them up. They were a light reddish color and moved in a general north to south direction. They disappeared over my neighbors roof and I lost sight. I walked over to look south and didn't see them anymore. They may have banked east, or disappeared, at that point. At first, I thought it could be a meteor shower, but nothing looked aflame and it came in flat, not at a downward angle. They also surprised me being silent and appearing out of nowhere.",
