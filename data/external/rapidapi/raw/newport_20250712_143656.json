He saw it as it slowly moved right to left at the speed of the old satellites. It sudenly stopped. There was no noise as  helicopter would make. Everything was very quiet. There were no city lights. Then it fell straight down. We were both very quiet and there still was no noise.  Then it started zigging and zagging left and right back and forth up and down. It was still a pinpoint of light--far above english mountain. It stopped again and hovered for about half a minute. Still there was no noise. And then it -zip- went out of sight toward the right in the direction it had come from. My husband and I both asked each other if we had seen what we thought we had seen and did we see the same thing. It was not a flood light or a flashlight--just a bright pinpoint. We have night fished for thirty years and have never seen anything like that since...but my husband has died and I wanted someone the remember what we saw.I can tell you it was stange--We were not afraid of it--But it was eerie-- ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

While laying on the couch I received some kind of message to get up, grab the binoculars and lay under my skylight and look for movement. I remember seeing a couple flashes of light in the star field and being frustrated.  I said to myself \"come on now lets not play hide and seek\" just then I spotted what looked like two saucer shaped craft at about thirty thousand feet. They were huge I could make out lights emanating out from the edges, while coming to grip with the fact that I am looking at real UFOS suddenly through my field of view at about five hundred feet flew a totally silent black triangle. I only saw it for a moment because I was looking through the binoculars and it was so close. At this point I put down the binoculars and went down to my mothers apartment to tell her whats over the roof I think she was concerned that I was going crazy. Sitting in amazement over what I had just seen I started to feel frightened, cotton mouth, heart racing, the works it felt like I was being probed while sitting in that chair. My mother calmed me down and I gained my composure back, I said to myself no more star gazing tonight!. The following night I called my sister to talk about the event, she is a spiritual healer (healingthehologram.com) I told her that I felt like the aliens probed me. She told me to ask what the alien called itself the name Ether came to my mind weird!. We talked for hours till 9pm and I felt much better. As I hung up the phone I looked up and out the skylight and this time gliding at about 200 feet and 20mph rotating slowly was another huge silent triangle with orange plasma round lights on each corner, there is no doubt that they knew I was looking at them, it flew directly over head then turned 90 degrees and flew off WOW up close and personal!

      "story": "A bright orange light. Moved awkwardly up and down as it traveled across the sky...Like a fireball at one point then suddenly moves At first there was just one bright light that closly resembled a planet that was really close though and more of an orangy color than a white color. Suddenly after being still for a few minutes the object moved backwards quickly, did a circle, moved to the left and started to become more distant. The object moved away awkwardly. It was moving up and down. Really weird. Later, we saw 5 of them they were further away then the one seen before. They were all on the same side of the sky, as well. THey resembled stars even more. They were still for a bit then one by one or two at a time they started moving away to the right, all in the same direction. As they moved they did not travel straight they moved up and down slightly as the one before did as well. These objects were definitely not planes, because there were planes in the sky and they moved and looked very different. Plus, planes do not move up and down and do weird loop-d-loop things, nor do they stand still for a few minutes then move rapidly away. I swear this is true I am not even one to totally believe in UFO's. It was so weird. Oh and at one point it was like a fireball, and was stationary, then suddenly would start moving away and didn't look like a fireball anymore but more like a plane, but obviously different.

      "story": "Silver saucer with white flashing lights flew overhead I was 13 years old, in seventh grade, and I was at lunch with a fellow student and my teacher.  (My teacher took us out to lunch at a local restaurant for good behavior over the course of the school year.)  We sat in a booth, and I faced the window with my fellow classmate.  During the conversation I kept seeing a bright light in the distant sky outside.  I assumed it was the metal from an airplane reflecting the sunlight.  I kept looking out the window because the light drew closer.  I soon noticed the light was flashing, and I thought that it could be sunlight glinting off of a helicopter instead.  My curiousity remained, so I continued to watch it as the flashing light came closer and closer.  Soon enough it actually flew over the restaurant, and I was dumbfounded and in disbelief at what I saw.  It was a rather large, silvery metal saucer, and the flashing [white] lights were on the outer rim of the saucer.  They seemed to be flashing because the lights would turn on and off in a line, going round and round the rim.  Looking back, I suppose the lights could have seemed to be going round and round if the saucer were spinning, but at the time that did not seem to be the case.  Either way, I could not believe what I had seen.  I asked my friend sitting next to me if she had seen it, and she said she had not seen it.  I think they both thought I was crazy, but even to this day I cannot shake the image from my brain.  I know what I saw and I believe in my experience 100%.

      "story": "A montage of events, you figure out what this was, I really am not sure. While leaving a friends house in rural Monroe County, three of us stepped out onto the front porch.  I commented on a greenish glow in the horizon, but the other two friends thought I was being funny.   I didn't say anything more about it, but after about 1 minute, I noticed that the horizon had become substantially greener.  The neon green glow stretched from one end of the horizon, to the other.  This was a very large phenomenon.  I told the two I was with to look again, and they were very surprised by what we were now looking at.  Very soon after the horizon had taken on what was now a very green glow, objects began to materialize then dematerialize, and move in an \"S\" shape for about half an hour.  This is a description of the objects that materialized:  First, let me tell you that the night was perfectly clear.  The initial object appeared and had a cloud like texture, which literally materialized right before our eyes, but then began to expand outward in the a diamond shape, with the center being empty, yet it was aligned with the outer diamond shape.  After reaching a certain size of expansion, the object would dissipate, or dematerialize.  Then, more of the same object began to occur, and began occurring simultaneously in different areas of the horizon.  Very soon after, another object appeared, but this one was circular and would move in an \"S\" shape downward toward the earth, leaving an \"S\" trail, and then dissipating as well.  This also had a cloud like texture to it.  Several of both kinds of objects kept appearing and either expanding as a diamond shape until dissipating, or growing into a circular shape and moving in an \"S\" pattern, downward toward earth.  The sky remained a very strong glow of green, and then in what seemed to be the climax of the entire event, two objects, both about the shape and size of a full moon, seemed to materialize out of nothing, a single object in between them appeared and shot down toward earth, and then shot right back up again.  After this, the entire phenomenon began to slowly go away.  It took another 15 minutes for it all to stop, each of the objects I described, except for the final moon like objects, began to appear less and less, and the sky slowly turned back to normal, and then it was all gone.  Let me note, this phenomenon made no sounds.  Also, I ran in the house and called the Sheriff\u2019s department to ask if anyone had reported any strange phenomenon in the Northern part of the sky.  They said no, so I did not want to talk any further as they would have thought I was crazy.   I also called my sister who lived about 25 miles north of where I was and she said she saw nothing in the sky either.  So, I just ran back outside to continue watching.   My friends and I were in shock at what we just witnessed.   Then, I decided to go home, but I did notice every here and there, people were pulled over onto the side of the road watching the sky.  I have to think that they saw the same thing I did.   The following day, my friend who was with me, and attended the University of Michigan, asked a science professor if the northern lights were visible from where we were and he said they were not.  Besides, the northern lights don't do all that! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

While a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a friend, we were driving on a country road in a wooded area after dark.  We first saw a stationary orange rectangle on a ridge line about a quarter mile away.  As we drove along the base of the ridge about 20 seconds later we noticed an orange reflection in the windshield, and at that point I rolled down the window and stuck my head out the door to look straight up.  What  I saw at that point was a pair of rectangular orange panels moving in sync directly above our vehicle, just above the treetops, mirroring our path along the winding road.  This conitnued for about two miles.  The objects made no noise, and there was no wash of air hitting us from above.  I believe the panels were part of one object, located at the rear of it.  I kept my eyes fixed on it the entire time and when we came to a stop sign I jumped out of the vehicle and it shot straight away from us, slightly gaining altitude, but made no noise.  It did not disappear over a horizon line, but disappeared from view in the distance in less than two seconds.  I estimate each orange rectangle to have been about 15 by 20 feet and about 20 feet apart, with the outer edges angled slightly forward.

      "story": "Strange U.F.O. space craft spotted over Newport Maine. Tuesday January 27th 2009 at 11:30 pm, In Newport Maine, I happened to look out my kitchen window and see a very large distinct U.F.O. space craft up in the sky. It appeared to be hovering above somewhere over the town of Hermon Maine. It was initially slowly making it's way left towards Bangor then it stopped in mid air and hovered for about 30 seconds, it then moved back towards the right and stopped and hovered again, it hovered for about 2 minutes and then slowly started hovering straight down until it dissapeared out of sight due to the tree line. It had distinct white and red flashing lights that didn't match up to any plane or helicopter that I've seen at night before. It also didn't have any audible sound in the sky like a plane would. It also seemed quite low in the sky as well as moved any direction it pleased. My grandfather also witnessed it right along side of me. A gentlemen who works with my grandfather said his wife (and her female passenger in her car) saw the same U.F.O. earlier that night at around 9:30 pm on her way home from the bangor/hermon area. She said that she stopped on a hill heading home to watch the U.F.O. and she said that it looked pretty nearby to her. She said it just hovered for a while and then dissapeared out of sight. I could clearly tell from my observations that night, that this was some type of unexplainable U.F.O. space craft.",

      "story": "Bright lime green orb that appeared, hovered, and then quickly shot downward leaving green trail. It was on Saturday, December 11 2010 around 3:30 a.m. I was out behind my house in my garage working. I had to move a car from the back and park out front. After I parked the car I started to walk back to my shop. The walk is approximately 60 feet. It was a cool clear night, the stars were out with almost no clouds. As I walked back I saw how calm and clear it was. So I decided to stop and just admire how nice it was. There I stood for a good minute looking upward at the southern sky. Nothing obstructed my view, and I was looking in the same general direction the whole time. My eyes were about at a 45 degree angle with the horizon. As I said I was looking at the sky for a good minute and I am sure nothing but stars were there. Then suddenly in the calm and clear sky it appeared. Yes it just appeared, as if someone had flicked a light switch.  It was a very, very bright round sphere. It had a distinct edge to it.  It was a lime green color with a green lighted haze or fog pulsating and radiating all around it.  In relation to where I was standing I would have to say it was 400 feet forward.  The height was at least 250 to 350 feet up now judging from its position above the house below it.  To where I was the size was like a basket ball. Next to the stars it was much larger. It stayed there for at least 7 to 10 seconds, not moving an inch from where it appeared. Not getting any dimmer, or changing in any way.  When without any warning or change it quickly darted directly downward, leaving a straight bright lighted green haze trail behind it.  Within 10 seconds the lighted trail diminished completely, and nothing was there.  The whole incident happened quickly and only lasted at the most 20 seconds from start to finish.",

      "story": "Two separate sightings over a few hours of multiple red orbs over the eastern carolina coast. Two friends and I were using a small boat to cross the sound between Emerald Island and the mainland to camp on a small island over night. We set out right near sunset, and arrived on the island right as it was getting dark. We were located on the unnamed island just north east of Lovett Island on the southernmost shore. We started to set up camp in a hurry, as it was getting dark fast. As we were setting up the tent, my two friends started to look up at the sky and told me to do so. Over the main land, what seemed to be quite some distance away, was a glowing red orb slowly moving through the sky. It looked as if it was passing the auxiliary landing field for the local military base from the North, heading northeast. It looked as if it may have been traveling at the same speed as a helicopter, but we could hear no noise. It continued moving down the inland shore until we could no longer see it in the distance. We discussed what it may have been, but could not come to a conclusion. We haven\u2019t seen anything like it before. A few hours later is when an even more astounding sighting occurred after we set up camp and settled in. About two hours after settling in we ingested 25i-nbome, a legal hallucinogen. I know this might diminish the credibility of my witness for the following sighting, but I wish to report it either way. Might I also add that I could tell a difference between what was real and what was a hallucination. We were now sitting on a blanket looking at the stars facing south, southeast. One of my friends was in the tent having an argument on the phone. My friend again, with a surprised voice told me to look up. We both saw the same thing. There were three glowing red orbs, just like the one from earlier, heading in the same direction, this time over Emerald Island. Again, they were heading northeast towards Morehead city. From our perspective they were in the shape of a triangle with one UFO in front and the other two following. They kept this formation for around 40 seconds before the lead UFO broke off ahead of the others. Its glow began to dim before finally disappearing.  The other two were still bright and slowly moving down the coast. One orb seemed to drop three smaller colored orbs out of its bottom which fell quickly to the ground. This detail, however, I am unsure of because of its similarity to a hallucination. The three UFOs were very clear however.Suddenly a fourth red orb appeared coming from the ground (or ocean on the other side of the island). It rose in an arc shape before reaching the altitude of the other two. They moved in small increments with the trailing craft mimicking the same movement from behind as if it were being tugged by the leading two craft.  They moved down the coast like this as well before fading out of sight. Again the only detail that I believe may have been a hallucination was the orbs falling from one of the UFOs to the ground. Our third friend did not witness! this sighting because he refused to leave the tent. After this, the night was relatively calm with no more activity.",

My friends and I were on my boat, moored at the marina, watching the fireworks display over Yaquina Bay. The display ended around 10:30 pm.  I noticed a bright, solitary red light in the sky to the north.  It was traveling north to south, directly towards us, and I believed it to be an airplane; except the light was not flashing, and was much larger than lights on a plane.  I watched the light for about a minute, waiting to see flashing or other colors with it.  But there were no other lights or colors. I pointed it out to one of my friends who had remained after the fireworks display.  He and I watched this bright red light coming in our direction for about two minutes, trying to determine what it might be.  We considered it was probably a light from a Coast Guard helicopter.  That wasn\u2019t the case. Within about four minutes of first noticing the light, it was finally directly overhead, at an altitude of about 1,000 feet.  We then knew it was not an airplane, or a helicopter.  It made no sound whatsoever. It appeared to be traveling faster than any plane that would have been flying overhead.  Almost immediately after it passed us, the light became smaller and dimmer, appearing to be less than half the original size. It seemed to be traveling more than twice as fast once it was south of us, than when it was coming towards us. Within about 20 seconds after passing over us, the light seemed to shrink until it was completely gone. We have no idea what was generating that bright red light thatwe were watching for almost five minutes.",

During observation of stars at a local beach, where the land is low for miles and a majority of the sky is unobstructed, we noticed a slow moving white light with a rotating red sphere around it. We could not tell if the red was a solid or a light but it appeared to be rotating in a vertical position tightly around the white light.  Flying height was similar to small aircraft, appearing to be about 1 mile horizontally and 1 mile vertically from our viewpoint.  No flashing lights or strobes were seen.  No other colored lights were seen except for the white and red.  Object was moving from East to West horizontally.  It never appeared to be floating or moving upwards or downwards.  No noise was heard from the object.  One or two small aircraft were also flying in the sky at the time and this object did not compare to the small aircraft lighting. Once noticed, we watched the object for about 30-60 seconds and then the lights completely shut off or object disappeared in thin air.  From our viewpoint object was about 45 degrees above horizon, well above any distant landscape.  We could not find it after that even though the sky was clear and unobstructed. Both observers are college educated and one is an amateur astronomer.",

At first we saw just one of them as it came into view over the top of neighborhood buildings.  We thought it was a helicopter floodlight or maybe searchlight since we live right on the coast.  But it didn't look like the same color as the normal U.S. Coast Guard helicopter searchlights that we see from time to time here.  My girlfriend and I stood up at the same time to walk out to get a better look, and we could see that there were five of these \"lights\" floating by in formation.  They looked like \"fireballs\" and they were flying not directly over us, but close enough to get a good long look.  They were flying at about the same altitude as helicopters or other aircraft might fly at, and flew faster than something just drifting by, like a balloon or something.  They did not make any sudden changes in flight pattern, they just went silently past us and headed southwest out over the Pacific Ocean.  We just stood there in amazement and wondered what we were seeing, while trying to capture with our cell phone camera.  We did manage to get around 10 seconds of these strange lights pretty good.  On the recording, it looks part fireball and part weird lights.  Very unusual!",

      "story": "Object in night sky lands/communicates with Vega. On 5/11/14 at approximately 23:45, I was soaking in my hot tub facing South.  The Moon was 2 days shy of being full yet there was still plenty of stars to see on that clear night. I noticed a couple quick flashes directly under the Moon and quickly came to the conclusion it was a satellite.  Then, I saw the object heading East and knew right away it was moving too fast to be a satellite.  After about 3 seconds, the object shot 90 degrees and suddenly stopped.  I thought to myself, \"way too fast to be anything man made yet too slow to be a shooting star or other space garbage.\"  Not to mention, it didn't 'burn out'. At that moment, I knew it was not of this world.  The object moved up and down and then headed to a bright star.  I later learned from my phone app, Google Sky Map, the star was Vega located in the constellation Lyra.  I could barely see the object as it seemed to closely orbit Vega.  About three minutes later, the object headed North and I lost sight of it. The whole sighting was as if I was looking at a dim star/satellite that was moving at different speeds.  All I can think of is how fast that object must have been going to travel the distance it did in such a short period of time.   Also, if it was a craft of some kind, how could I see it with the naked eye?  My only conclusion is it travelled through some worm hole?  Maybe it wasn't a craft but a form of energy?  I am reporting this in hope that someone else saw it too.  Very interested in if anyone has any thoughts on what I saw also.",

I mentioned that it stopped, then it started again.  Then it seriously was like we jumped it. It seemed as if it had picked us up on rader and it was busted. It then went to my right and sort of toward two o'clock.  Then it swooped back toward it's starting point.  As it did, it seemed to spin around and this intense white white white light shines, right into my eyes, and W2's.  But, it doesn't light up around us or the surrounding sky, like a lighthouse would.  As quick as it shined it kept spinning to it's previous pulsating light. It came in circular form in the object.  Like on a belt; from it's left rear, around the front of it, so bright, then to the right and behind.  But only once.  It was like, for the moment the light was right on, it was the only focus. W2 said, \"It was like a photographer, five feet in front of you.  And that's about how long it was there, just a flash.\"  It then kept going to the left at a stable speed, keeping a line, until it was gone.  So W2 and I finally come back to the house and are talking about it outside when W3 comes down.  We start telling him about it, and this light starts coming back across the sky, left to right. W2 and W3 saw it turn and head toward the two o'clock direction where it was going to go when we first came upon it. I saw it disaper into the trees. It wasn't too far off.  A jet plane flew over around the same time and it seemed further away than this thing. It's movements, no sign of jet fuel, no sound.  Intense bright light with no rays...  My heart is a pounding.

My husband and I were sitting on the balcony of our fourth story hotel room, enjoying each other and the ocean.  I saw what appeared to be a shooting star appear from the side of our hotel and said, \"Look!  A shooting star,\" so my husband saw it also.   After a second, I realized it was white and disc shaped.  It appeared to be smaller and a whole lot closer, maybe about the elevation a drone would have been at.   It was angled downward and slightly towards the ocean as it slowly fell.  We kept watching as it as it changed angles and speed, darting directly parallel to the ocean.   As it continued to travel, it slowed again making a boomerang type movement, then darted up to the shore.  It was nearly directly in front of my hotel room and approximately 3 feet above the ocean, it moved slowly back and forth over a few feet of length directly parallel to the shoreline.  It appeared to fade in and out of vision a few times, then reappear a short distance ahead of where it was.  It was as if it kept travelling the same speed and distance, but was fading in and out.   Directly underneath, it appeared 3 beings with white faces that appeared to glow.  They were very visible, even in the dark. After about a minute, the disc disappeared, but the beings remained, and they were directly aligned. From the fourth floor I could not judge size exactly.  These beings had dark bodies, it was easy to see their movements.  They would bend down to the sand, or sit down, then get back up, all at the same time.  They stayed in formation, most times a line, and pretty soon they multiplied.  Nothing flew in or out, they just appeared. 3 became 6, 6 became 8 and at final count there were about ten.   My husband had decided to go out and see up close what was there.  I watched as he made his way down to the ocean.  The beings appeared to become smaller, my husband said he saw that as well.  He said there was a strange energy as he got closer to them.  What he saw were about 10 large birds that were not sea birds.  He was able to walk up closely to them, but they did not startle.  He then shooed them, and they flew off.  When he did that, from the fourth floor, I was able to see that as soon as they moved they were flying.  That means if anything would have flown into view, I would have seen it clearly. I am not looking for scrutiny or publicity, so I would really appreciate if this post could be kept confidential.  This event lasted about 40 minutes in total, but i did not want to take my eyes off of them to go and get a camera.  I figured they could have vanished any minute and I wanted to see as much as I could.  I have additional details that I did not put in this report.  Please contact my husband or me with further questions. Much Respect, ((names deleted))",

I was located roughly 3 miles south of the local municipal airport and was outside stargazing before going to sleep, when I noticed a light and what appeared to be the underside of a vehicle lit from below traveling overhead. My first instinct was to get excited, thinking I was viewing the ISS traveling past. I knew that at those altitudes, they are usually still lit by the sun while other areas are in pitch black.  I then realized that this object in no way resembled the ISS and would have been far smaller if it were. Being near the municipal airport, I then tried to guess if it was a plane or helicopter, but the object consisted of a single light (approximately as bright as Sirius) and a main body that split into a \u201cT\u201d shape that appeared lighted from below.  It seemed to be traveling low, but there was no sound at all \u2013 we normally have helicopters flying overhead and can hear them very clearly, especially when all other daily traffic is gone.  The \u201cT\u201d shaped section was moving approximately 30-45 degrees off axis, so I knew it could not be a plane. Located along the coastal highway, I watched as this object moved into the tree line.  I was unable to grab a picture with my camera phone, so I jumped in the car to a lookout point along the ocean about .5miles away.  By the time I pulled in and got out (about 2 minutes max) it had already disappeared, having flown off over the water in a west-southwest direction. I\u2019m a scientist for Oregon State University, and have seen many type of aircraft, but this was nothing I know about.

Jan 25, 2017 at 0300,  Spouse and I went riding around starting at 0120 after going to bed early.  The stars were extremely bright out, and we had seen more than twenty deer, with multiple raccoons, hogs, the normal country back road animals.  We have been doing this on and off the past two weeks and nothing seemed out of ordinary.   We decided before going home to go to a hidden place we found early on that was secluded off of hwy 1125 and Speights Road.  Car turned off, husband had the night vision and was sitting out of the window, my window down occ.  Flashing my light.   I had seen a bright star but initially didn\u2019t think anything of it.  I layed my head on the car door and stared at the stars for a second then would turn and turn my flashlight on again.  This time the brightest largest bright white light/star but it was moving slightly just enough to notice from like being in a box and bouncing off the sides.   I called out to my husband two or three times quietly, then knocked him in the leg.  He climbed back into the seat.  I pointed at it and said, \u201cIs that what I think it is?\u201d  He was quiet and just looking then said, \u201cLook at these coming in.\u201d   Four circular, hazy, orange, orbs came up to the left of the bright \u201cstar.\u201d  The orbs went from a straight line to a chevron form two or three times before noticing there was more orange orbs coming from behind us.   The bright star moved closer but stayed just below the tree line, looked like when the star blinked the orbs changed formation.  When number 8-9 orbs showed up I was too nervous to stay any longer, but never got the feeling of being threatened.  We were able to see them until very close to 287 and just before town there was a very large plane/shuttle that crossed from our right to our left at a fairly slow speed for a \u201cplane.\u201d  The back of it had red and green lights on the back of it.  Once we went over the overpass/287 we didn\u2019t see them anymore.",

My mother and I were traveling in a car towards Newport at 4:30 PM, when a moving light caught my notice.  My mother was only able to take a short look at the object as she was driving the car at the time.  I watched it for ten minutes, searching over possible explanations for the strange object.  It lacked the consistent blinking and red and green light color common to planes.   The altitude at which the object maneuvered, I would estimate, was like that of a plane (39,000 feet), possibly lower.  The object moved fairly quickly and was lit by white/yellow light which appeared to rotate.   I lost sight of the object when it moved behind a large cloud and apparently disappeared.",

It got slightly bigger as it seemed to get closer to the ground. It lit up the cloud and tunrded it bright white, where it then looked like a disk.   After it did that it seemed to have literally just dissapeared.  A few seconds of still watching the sky in shock, it appeared again and it got closer, had pushed thru the clouds, and appeared to have blinking lights of some kind.  Literally it shot off after about 3 minutes of it moving thru the sky",

The object is pretty much a cigar shaped thing and was metallic.  The object I assume is pretty high altitude judging by the original photo.  Sadly, I can't remember what the object was doing since it was a while a go. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
