It changed colors as it streaked across the horizon, going from south to north, parallel to the ground but seeimg to arc downward as it disappeared over the northern horizon.   I expected an implosion and braced myself but neither saw nor heard any evidence of ground impact.  There was no tail, no stream, and no noise as it moved across the sky. It wasn't far away and it wasn't high above.  And, it was large. Can't say how large. If it had been a meteor it would have made a tremendous expolsion.  Meteors do not, I believe, move parallel to the ground.  Later, at work, I fouind out that another person, a woman, an English as a Foreign Language instructor as myself, had also seen the fireball that same morning at the same time.  In fact, she and her teenage daughter had seen it as they drove to the girl's school. There were no reports of sightings either in the newspapers or TV news broadcasts.

      "story": "First 7 then up to a dozen lights at very high altitude darting around. My wife and I were on vacation visiting San Antonio, Texas staying at Holliday Inn on the \"River Walk\". We were on the roof of the building in the Hot Tub when another couple joined us who we did not know. We chatted a little with them and they were visiting from Witchita Kansas where the Male was employeed at Boeing (As an Engineer if my memory is correct). My wife asked \"What is that!\" and she was looking up and over at a 45+ degree angle (cannot remember direction E or W). The four of us looked up and saw 7 lights darting around eachother like fire flies in the sky. I did not have my glasses on at this point and I said it was probably sparkler fire works from one of the theme parks near by. The make of the other couple said \"No, that is not fireworks!\" and he, his wife and mine got out of the hot tub and watched the lights dance in the sky. I rushed over to the table and retreived my glasses and was shocked when I put them on. The number of lights had grown to about a dozen lights very very high in the sky. The lights looked as though they were forward pointing lights on individual craft and as they changed direction and the light pointed away the light would disappear to us and another would appear as it banked its turn and came back down. We watched in quiet awe for half an hour. We were interupted by a security guard that came out and told us the roof/pool/spa was now closed and we had to leave. I asked him \"What the hell is that?\" and he looked up and says he has no idea. We agreed that the lights were well above commercial flight altitude. The security guard was an older man who said he was retired military and he had never seen anything like it either. After a few minutes he made us leave the roof. My wife and I walked all around the building looking out windows trying to see the lights but the angle was wrong. We have talked for many years now about what we saw. I am curious if there are any other reports during that time frame in that location. ((name deleted)) Plano, Texas ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

I am very skeptical, myself, but I cannot identify what my girlfriend and I saw that night.  Right above tree line was a v-shaped craft. At first only three lights shined on each point of the triangle. The lights were similar to those new, almost blue, lights you see on some cars (neons?). The craft was moving too slow to be a regular plane. It couldn't have been a helicopter. A few moments later, more lights came on. I didn't count exactly but I'd estimate a total of 7 lights at this point. The object speeded up a little and eventually moved out of sight.  It sounded like...? Wind? Like a very quite plane, but no engine sound.  Wish I had known to count and notice direction. I was in shock at the time. Wasn't really thinking about anything else except to watch it...  I have to note that there IS a military base nearby, so perhaps the object I saw was some new test plane? I have no idea. It was the weirdest thing I have ever seen.

I could not see the triangle shape, but saw lights at each corner (three lights) that made up a form of a triangle. The lights were not blinking. I do not recall if there was a blinking light or not anywhere on the object. The aircraft appeared to be on it's side and appeared to be \"tumbling\" forward. It then leveled off and made a 90 degree turn. This aircraft was going very fast. This sighting took place about a mile from Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. I do not know what this aircraft was, but I do know three things: 1) I have never seen an aircraft tumble forward and then level off in this manner. 2) I have never seen an aircraft travel at the rate of speed it was traveling. 3) I know of no aircraft that can make a 90 degree turn at this rate of speed, although the B-2 Stealth Bomber comes close, but I know that it does not tumble on its side. I have been observing aircraft for a long time and have worked on different types of aircraft in my carrer. This was no regular aircraft!",

I have been searching for information regarding an event that occurred to me around this same time period in the same city, and I found a report that describes almost the same thing on your site as a \"Blue Energy Egg\" (Occurred : 3/17/2000 04:00 (Entered as : 3/17/00 4:00am) Reported:  10/23/2000 23:31 Posted:  2/25/2003  Location:  San Antonio, TX  Shape:  Triangle  Duration:  2 minutes).  It was around this same time period that I was living in Twin Lakes Mobile Home Park, and I remember waking up and seeing the bedroom of the mobile home filled with a blue light that seemed to be coming from the SW(?)side of the mobile home.  With the blinds drawn it appeared in the bedroom window that a bright blue light circular in shape was being cast onto the window but illuminated the entire inside of the mobile home.  So it had a point of origin but appeared to be equally brilliant in the room...if that makes sense.  At the time, I was a Police Officer at Ft. Sam Houston, I had no idea why this woke me, there was no noise and my ex-wife did not wake up, I immediately got up and secured my pistol as my first thought was pranksters or somebody trying to do ill to me or my family. as soon as I secured my weapon I began to attempt to look through the blinds to see where the light was coming from and as I did this POOF...the light was gone.  I checked the other windows before heading outside, armed, to investigate.  When I went out on the rear deck, I heard and saw nothing.  No animal noises, like dogs barking, etc. that would indicate anything was wrong.  Very still and quiet.  I chalked it up to craziness and went back to bed.  Odd thing is, last few days I have had dreams about this incident that spurred me to look, and I found this here.  WOW....

It was around 2 AM and as I slowly walked closer to it I noticed it looked like a huge hawk or eagle that was as big as a man. It was hovering w/ it's wings closed. I heard a low mechanicle sound coming from it. I also heard some tones like you would hear on a computer or telephone. I picked up a rock and threw it at the object. I saw the rock deflect off of it and when the rock hit it, it sounded like it was hitting metal. The object spreaded it's wings in mid air, I briefly saw tiny green and red lights flash on it, and then it made a sound like a hawk or eagle as it began to fly towards the south. I would guess this thing was 5 to 6 ft in height, and had a 15 to 20 ft wing spand.  Afterwards I read this one story online that a college kid from Colorado went to Mexico with a couple of his classmates that were from that country. They were hiking near the US-Mexico border outside of Texas in the late 1990s. They were resting between two hills behind some large trees near an isolated road. A military type vehicle drove up and stopped. The college hikers were out of it's view about 30 yards away. Four men got out of the vehicle, three of them appeared to be Chinese and one a Mexican National. The three men that appeared to be Chinese seemed to be speaking in an oriental language.  About two minutes later the college hikers saw this huge bird fly up and landed 20 yards from the four men. They went and got the huge bird and carried it and placed it in the back of their vehicle, then drove away.  I thought this story might have some connection to what I witnessed in July 2006.  My guess is that this bird type object could be some sort of spying flying object that an Asian country such as China is conducting on the U.S.  I've heard of several large bird sightings in the Southwestern USA for years.  I just find all this to be interesting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

      "story": "UFO sighting in San Antonio, Texas My grandparents and I were driving into San Antonio, Texas yesterday, just before noon, and I was taking pictures of the beautiful hill country from the car window, when I looked up in the sky towards the sun and saw this flat saucer-like object in the sky. I pointed it out to my grandmother, who was in the passenger seat at the time and she also saw it.  I managed to get one picture of it with my digital camera before it moved, it kept changing positions around the sun, it was first on the left, then above it, then underneath it. I took some more various photos but they are a bit blurry but still easy to see. About two minutes after I started taking photos of the object I spotted two round objects very close together in the sky, that were different colors. I also have a picture of them.  I also took one photo, and didn't see the object until I got home and enlarged the photo on my computer, it was a silver colored perfectly spherical object, in front of a cloud which was in front of the sun. I took about 10 photos total, and about 5 of them actually have the visible objects.  The whole sighting lasted only about 5 minutes total. It wasn't until I got home that I saw on the news that there was another sighting that evening in Texas, in Baytown. I thought that was eerie.  The pictures I have have not been altered, I have the exact originals on my computer and still on my camera as well, but I also have copies where I enlarged the objects and cropped them.",

You could see this light pass through the clouds, that\u2019s how powerful that light was. It was low in the horizon and just hovered in the sky. A couple minutes later a second bright yellow light appeared next to it about a football field length away. It wasn\u2019t as bright as the first and it too hovered in place. After about 5 minutes of staring at it, they began to alternate in brightness. One would get dim and the other brighter. I had never seen anything like this before. After about 5 minutes of that, one of the lights began to move away in a southwest direction. It was slow moving but as it passed overhead the light disappeared. While this was happening the other light remained hovering in place. After the 1st light dimmed out the second light followed in the same direction and passed closer to us where I could make out the shape of the object. It was diamond shaped and had bright yellow lights on each corner. It too dimmed out and vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

My friend and I were driving south on San Pedro Ave. around 8:00 pm, when we noticed three triangular dark (black) shaped objects, along with a circular (ball shaped) object flying at low altitude in the middle of the city, about 2.5 miles south of the San Antonio Airport.  We both noticed them at the same time and tried to figure out what they could be.  We named every possible flying object and discounted every single thing that it could have been. We were facing south, and they were to the west of us flying south. They were at a distance of about 150 to 200 yards away. They slowed down and then hovered in one area for a few seconds then turned and faced west and started to fly west.  But when they turned, the triangular shaped objects became \"sliver like\" thin, except the ball shaped object, and continued on.   About the time when they were almost out of our view, we were surprised to see another strange triangular shaped object with something hanging from it, just beneath it.  We thought it might have been an \"ultralight\" singleman plane with someone sitting in the seat below the wing, but quickly dismissed due to the fact that it was beginning to become dark outside, and the fact that small air crafts like \"ultralights\" are not allowed in the city.  And we had just had a light rain storm in some areas of the city with lightning reported in other areas with no rain. Near my house the sky was green with no rain or lightning. (My house was about the same area where the objects would have been flying over.)  They also made no sound, and flew very slow and uniform. My friend and I are still very perplexed over what we both witnessed and wondered if anyone else saw the objects too.",

The lights were circular and appeared to be on each ends of the chevron shape. Then in the middle i noticed a red light not as big as the other light I would say about half the size of the other light which appeared to be about the same size as the wing. For a minute i thought maybe it is a plane or maybe it's just a helicopter so i rolled the window down but no noise. Certainly if it was one the 2 aircrafts i would hear something. Then I noticed it was flying way too slow to be an airplane or helicopter. It almost seemed as it was hovering over but it was moving. I drove under it and lost sight then I looked in the mirror to see it because I was still coming to grasp with what I saw. But when I looked in the mirror I didn't see it. I thought maybe the angle I was at didn't allow me to see so I turned the car around, and to my suprise it was gone completely from the sky. I looked around to see maybe it just trailed off but i was gone.",

      "story": "Guitar Pick shaped UFO Flies Over Houses In San Antonio Subdivision My wife with brother and I were sitting outside on our patio deck when I noticed something I thought might have been a floating bag drifting over from the direction of our neighbors house toward us. I pointed it out to my wife and made a joking comment about it being a UFO as she is a serious skeptic on the subject. My brother and I started discussing how the object was at a high altitude for it being a plastic bag and discussed the physics behind the strength of the wind needed for it to stay aloft. As we  we discussing this, the object made a lazy L-shaped U-turn toward the house behind us. It was at this point that both my brother and my wife noticed that the object had a \"guitar-pick\" shape and was not a plastic bag. I also noticed that the object was rocking back and forth on its axis in a slow wobble. We stood motionless watching the object as it continued toward the street in front of the house behind ours. I would approximate its altitude at being between 50-100 feet from the ground. Its length was 3-5 feet and had almost no width that I could see, making it extremely flat. The objects color was very white with no lights or moving parts seen. It made no sound that we could hear. When it reached the next street behind our house it started to gain altitude steadily. We could not begin to guess the speed at which it rose but it must have been extremely fast because it reached a very high altitude in around 30 seconds. At some point before we lost sight of it in the sky, I noticed that there was a tiny white round object that had seemingly materialized from the sky and flew very close to the \"guitar-pick\". I mentioned this to my brother who then stated that I must have been staring too long at the sky and was seeing a reflection of the light. I stood close to him and pointed the object out. He grew excited as he saw another white orb streak by the \"guitar-pick\". My wife suddenly pointed out yet another one moving in the opposite direction the other 2 had taken. These white orbs were moving at speeds that were impossibly fast and seemed to orbit the \"guitar-pick\" in motion. The \"guitar-pick\" at this time was almost out of visual range but looked as if it was still gaining in altitude. There were no other aircraft in the sky that day. There are sometimes military aircraft in the vicinity but as it was a Sunday very few if any were flying. I served in a ADA (Air Defense Artillery)Army unit for 3 years and can readily identify many types of aircraft by sight and sound. I have never witnessed anything to the same likeness before and probably will never again.",

He quickly told me it was probably just a plane. It started rising higher and higher but not coming any closer so we started walking down our couldesac to go check it out. We walked closer and it seemed as if two human objects were glowing in the sky. The objects weren't lights, as they were just a very bright glow. As I am a christian and never believed in U.F.O.'s I thought the second coming of christ was happening and told my brother.\u00a0 We were drawn to the glowing objectst by curiousity. It hovered high for about ten minutes and the two glowing balls seemed to turn back into one glowing ball. It almost is as if it knew we were there. We ran back home scared and it's almost as if it followed us. We looked over head and it's almost as if it slowed down, not like any plane can do but rather fast. Then we both saw it overhead and it looked like some type of plane but with a triangular shaped \"torso\". It took off very fast and had basically no noise whatsoever. I heard what sounded like little girls singing, but I'm not sure if this was the sound of the plane or not.  I did some research and found out about the Aurora project and looked at videos on Youtube and Google articles, it looks similiar to those projects but still not entirely sure, it seemed to all happen so fast. I now am a firm believer that I U.F.O.'s exist, regardless if it was exrtra terrestials or a government project. My brother called the non emergency policy number and told the lady he was a college student that wasn't prank calling or doing drugs. They said they would have somebody check it out.

He and his girlfriend were outside along with two of there neighbors, witnessing lights in the sky. They said they were all moving very fast and changing directions. My husband and I did not see what they were talking about but as we were about to go back inside, we did see something. It looked just like a star in the sky, so it was in outer space. It was moving upwards in a vertical direction in the sky. It was moving so fast! Within seconds it had moved from right above the horizon line to the other side of the sky. I don't think it was a satellite because I don't think they travel that fast. It definitely wasn't a plane or a jet because it was like a star, so I know that it was in space. Maybe it was the space station? I thought it would be brighter though. Anyways, that's what we saw, but our friend says he saw much more that night.",

It was a clear and breezy night around 8:30pm when my daughters and I saw somthing weird in the sky when I brought it to my daughters attention. We were on our way to drop one of my daughter's off at grandmas house.  Whatever it was in the sky, the craft was like going crazy and zigzagging in the air as we were driving slowly trying not to loose it. We saw bright lights in the sky so we went to drop her off and on the way home to our apartment we saw it again but this time it kinda disappear what we thought it did so as I was coming into the complex I just turned over to the left thru some bushes there it was something hovering over these large trees and I told my daughter do you see that. She said yes it was round on the bottom of it was like a dome with a bright light and a circle of lights on the bottom of that. It was grayish-black and we still had the car running and all I could think of to get the camera inside the house.We were surprise and stunned. So we left to get the camera but if was gone. On Oct.19, 2006 we saw another sighting but this time around the same time again but it was above us. This craft was going slow throughout the air there was no sound but the craft was flying slowly and made a kinda of a u turn towards us I was yelling to my daughter to call her brother outside but I stood there looking in the air and the craft was coming towards and we got to see the structure of the craft underneath it.It was triangluar with 3 lights on the corners of it. It look huge above us we were also stunned couldnt believe we were seeing this underneath it.Then all of a sudden it turn around and disappear.",

It has a very nice view of all downtown and then some, and has a great view of the city.  It was very late for me and was about 3:30am.  My friend had taken off for awhile to go inside his apartment.  While he was gone, I was noticing the historic Emily Morgan Hotel and a hawk- like bird, which seemed to be huge flying around the top of the building that was lit.  I thought it was rather odd, so I keep on looking in that direction.  Before you know it, I was noticing an object that looked like a star that was very bright that just appeared from nowhere around the same area.  It was moving around the same general area and would disappear and reappear and was flying by really fast, I later found out that this was no star.  I thought this was really strange.  Then I was trying to follow it around with my eyes and I was really excited to be witnessing this.  Another light that looked like the same one appeared in another direction below that to the right and it looked like they would appear and reappear and fly away.  I was really excited to be seeing this and hoped that it would last as long as possible.  Later, I had seen a third object that had looked like the same of them appear in another direction (to the lower left), kind of like an off triangle formation.  By this time, my friend had come back and I was hoping that he saw the same thing that I was seeing just to reaffirm and because I just couldn\u2019t believe it.  He saw the same thing that I was seeing.  For about 20-30 minutes, these 3 light objects were appearing and disappearing, getting brighter and lighter, and seemed to be like dancing in the sky between one another.  It was the coolest and most bizarre thing that I have ever witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

Im telling this exactly as it happened because I think alot of people don't come forward like they should so I'm telling what I saw.  Unfortunatley, I never thought of reporting it til now, but this is how it went. It happned around mid september 2008 in San antonio Tx, on the Southeast side.  Me and my friends ((male name #1 deleted)) and ((male name #2 deleted)) were walking we were about a little past ((female name deleted)) coming down Schley going the west when Nathan told us to look in the sky,I didnt see it at first until my friend nathan pointed it out, but when I did I was like \"What the hell is that!!!\"   The thing seemed to be about a mile away and it didnt seem to do much but move real slow.  But let me tell you, I watch the History channel and seen about stealth but damn this was like nothing I've ever seen.  The thing would kinda glow on and off to where when it would glow, there were about 20, what I guess could be called bulbs, floating in a triangular formation that would turn white, but then it turned transparent. It continued to do this at about a rate of 1 pulse every 2 seconds, fading white then gone, white then gone, non stop. The thing moved real slow and kinda, came towards our way as we were walking. The whole time I was freaking out to seeing something like that. At one point I tried to take a picture but my camera phone wasnt able to zoom that far or even make it out at all. So we continued looking at it until it went behind some trees and we couldnt see it anymore. Just for the refrence,  This thing was not a plane, It was not birds, or a meteroite or any natural occurance for that matter. It was something beyond my undertanding. I've never seen a plane fly that slow either, it just cant be done... I've seen planes all my childhood when my dad worked on them. This was not a plane! And I've never seen a bird change colors before. We know what we saw and I will put it on everything to stand by it. But what could this possibly mean?  Are they here to observe us?  Or is it the government?     -Thank you ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It was a slower day and I was parking a vehicle behind the hotel in the parking lot.  As I was walking I was looking up across the top of the hotel for a hawk that usually picks off pigeons and stuff.  I then noticed an object, not directly above the hotel, but from my line of sight I can surmount that it was just a little bit further out over the city.  The first thing that popped in my mind was that it looked as if someone had placed a black gumdrop in the sky.  I am a college student and I know what things are, this was no helicopter or anything that could have been produced with our current technology.  It was clear as day right before my eyes, almost as if I could reach out and grab it.  I attempted to take a picture with my phone but could not get a distinguishable shot.  From what I could see there were no openings, lights, windows, or protrusions of any kind; just a solid be! ll/gumdrop shaped object.  There were cirrus clouds that day so I was able to gauge if it was moving, it wasn't.  I watched it for about 3-5 minutes then I ran inside, down to the maintenance room to see if the engineering guys had any binoculars.  There weren't any so I ran back up to the front to see if any guests had arrived, everything was clear so I immediately ran to the back again because the sun and trees obscured my vision in the front.  When I got back, I searched for it and was able to find it again, still there not moving.  Total time elapsed so far would of been about 8 minutes.  I watched it for another 2 or so minutes until I was interrupted by my radio that a guest needed assistance in the front.  When I was done with that I ran back again only to find nothing there that time.  I waited for a few minutes watching the sky around me but could not find it.  When this was over I went back to the front and about ten minutes later I noticed a very high altitude je! t going over, heading roughly north to south.  Then after that! one had passed, about 5 minutes later, another high altitude jet flew south to north.  I hadn't seen anything like that fly over all day, so if it was a coincidence then it was perfect timing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

It was almost 12:30 at night when I was walking back to my apartment complex. I was walking through the grass in the front of the apartments that had a gate where u could get back in.  Anyways I was just about to the gate when I saw a very bright blue light out of the cirbir of my eye. I looked up at the sky and there was this blue oval looking object.  The object was I would have to say less than a half mile in the sky. It was there and gone as soon as I looked up at it. It appeared to be moving downward into a field right across the street. I was very scared of the fact that it moved so quickly and seemed to vanish before getting to the ground. There was no noise at all from the object. I would have to say I was less than 300 yards away from it as well.  As soon as I saw it vanish I felt chills.  The area where the object was has a lot of dear that roam around at night. I didn't see any dear in sight. It's about an hour after I have witnessed the unidenitifief object.  I still don't see any deer, and they are always coming into the field around this time from across the street where I spores the object.  Anyways like I said I looked up saw a blue oval looking object and as fast as I saw it, the thing shot downwards and appeared to vanish all within about 2 seconds.  That's as much information as I'm available to give about what I've seen.  It's late and I'm shooken up about it.  I hope my information helps.",

      "story": "Three separate sightins which ocurred in rural south Texas between 01/01/03 and 03/01/09. I have lived in various towns South Texas since 1999.  Since 2004, I have worked outdoors most if this time, mostly at night with minimal light pollution from large cities.  I have three separate sightings to report with no specific dates, regrettably.  All I cab say is that the first sighting occurred after 01/01/06 before 2007.  The second sighting occurred between 01/03/09 and 02/20/09.  The third sighting occurred between 04/01/09 and 05/15/09.  The first two sightings occurred while I was working.  The last sighting occurred during my off time.  I will recount my experiences here. All three sightings occurred in the rural Texas landscape in between Del Rio, Texas to the west, San Antonio, Texas to the north, Corpus Christi, Texas to the east and Laredo, Texas to the south.  In between these four cities are smaller, rurally populated towns.  Outside of the towns are millions of acres of privately owned ranch land that is inaccessible to few consisting of ranch owners, their families, hunters and in areas closer to the Mexican border, the U.S. Border Patrol. I\u2019d like to emphasize that this area in between the aforementioned cities is sparsely populated and dominated by private land.  Also, after I had observed the objects in all three sightings, I believed the aircraft to be military.  The cities of Del Rio and San Antonio have Air Force installations.  The city of Corpus Christi has a Naval Air Station.  There is also a bombing range approximately 30 to 40 miles east of Cotulla, Texas on Farm to Market Road (FM) 624. I will report these observations as clearly and accurately as I can, devoid of any opinion or speculation.  I did mention earlier that I believed these objects to be military, but that\u2019s based on the fact that these events occurred within the triangle of those installations where there are several remote miles to operate in without many eyewitness accounts. FIRST SIGHTING: I was with a coworker traveling westbound on the FM Road 133 which connects Artesia Wells, Texas (LaSalle County) to Catarina, Texas (County).  Both towns are sparsely populated and are surrounded by dense brush for several miles.  Artesia Wells is a town of probably 20 that is approximately 50 miles north of Laredo, Texas, outside of it\u2019s city limits and maybe 90 miles outside of San Antonio, Texas.  Artesia Wells is on IH-35 in a heavily traveled stretch of highway that is relatively clo0se to the Mexican border. FM 133 is maybe 15 to 20 miles long and only runs from Artesia Wells to Catarina.  There are no tons in between Artesia Wells and Catarina.  Catarina has a population of maybe 50 or more, if not less. I am not certain as to the time of year, and do not want to speculate.  I do remember that I initially observed the object approximately 10 miles west of Catarina and thought that it was a low flying aircraft.  This was about 45 minutes before sunset.  Approximately 5 miles outside of Catarina, both my coworker and commented that the aircraft did not appear to be moving.  The object was several miles west of the FM 133 and Highway 83 intersection just south of Catarina. The object appeared to be black in color, triangular shaped with no lights or visible markings.  The object did not make any sounds that I could hear.  Also, the object appeared to be hovering.  The object\u2019s hover was not consistent with that of a helicopter in that a helicopter moves up and down and side to side as it hovers.  This object appeared to be perfectly still.  I did not notice and type of exhaust emitting from the vehicle. My coworker and I attempted to get as close as we could to the object via dirt roads.  The dirt roads we were on took us due south and not west.  The object appeared to be hovering over brush.  From my position, I couldn\u2019t identify any land monuments to pinpoint the object\u2019s location.  There were only trees and plants below the object.  I still would like to say that my coworker and I were still around about 10 miles or so from the object. We watched the object until the sun set.  The object remained stationary for the duration.  My coworker and I attempted to get the object\u2019s attention by pointing flashlights at it and using flashing lights while we were stationary. At sun set, the object became impossible to see with the naked eye.  I used night vision goggles to view the object.  With very little sub light being used as a light source, I could clearly see the object at the same location, still stationary.  My coworker observed the object through the night vision equipment as well. It was at this time that we left the area.  The object was not visible after sun set.  The object did not appear to have any lights. SECOND SIGHTING: I was working alone near the Artesia Wells area between the hours of 2200 and 0100 hours when I observed lights in the sky.  I was traveling westbound on a rural ranch road one mile south of Artesia Wells and approximately one mile from IH-35 when I first saw a bright light in the sky. On this night, the sky was clear and there did not appear to be any clouds in the sky.  I was I was traveling westbound, a bright light that I can best describe as resembling a headlight caught my eye.  The light was very bright and flashed on and off before disappearing.  There appeared to be lights north of this light\u2019s location; these lights seemed relatively close to the first light. I observed the very bright \u201cheadlight\u201d and the others for only a couple of seconds.  I continued traveling west until I reached IH-35.  I parked my vehicle, got out and attempted to signal the area where I observed the light with my flashlight. I was at the intersection of IH-35 and FM 133 when I attempted to signal this light.  At this point the light was not visible.  I scanned the sky and observed a high flying aircraft that could have been a plane.  This object was traveling southbound on the east side of IH-35 but crossed over IH-35 traveling westbound.  Shortly after crossing over, the object began to travel north.  It took the object between 8-12 minutes before it disappeared out of sight due to distance.  Another aircraft appeared to be several miles behind it. I turned my attention back to the west sky where I observed three high hovering objects.  These objects appeared to be in a triangular formation.  I could not make out any shapes or sizes.  The lights on these objects appeared to be consistent with conventional aircraft.  They omitted a white beacon every couple of seconds or so.  These objects did not appear to have the typical red port side light or green starboard side light that many aircraft and vessels have.  They remained stationary for several minutes, flashing. I attempted to signal these objects as well, to no avail. To characterize the initial object, I\u2019d say it was about the size of a military flare.  I did not emit smoke and a shadow like military flares and did not appear to be descending under a parachute like a military flare.  It is best described as a single vehicle headlight in the sky.  This object was not a radio or cell phone tower light and was not a vehicle.  It was too high in the sky to be mistaken for vehicle. This entire experience lasted about 30 minutes. THIRD SIGHTING: On this particular evening, I was traveling home from a shopping trip in Laredo, Texas with my family when my daughter, my wife and I observed an object in the sky.  I was at about the 27 mile marker of IH-35, two miles south of the Border Patrol checkpoint when I observed 4 to 5 bright lights, lined up within three to four times their width from each other.  These objects appeared to be in a much disciplined formation.  These objects appeared consistent with the object I saw in my second sighting.  The objects were very bright and appeared similar to headlights.  They flashed off sequentially, starting with the southern most light.  These lights were in the western sky. I immediately notified my wife and daughter and they too saw the lights.  I did not stop to investigate or signal to them.  I continued traveling northbound until arrival at the Border Patrol checkpoint. The 27 mile marker is approximately 27 miles form the Mexican border.  The lights appeared to be hovering over rural densely brushed and sparsely populated ranches.  There are no major towns or cities northwest of Laredo, Texas that would line up directly west of the 27 mile marker.  The nearest town would be Catarina which is several miles north of Laredo on Highway 83.  The next nearst town would be Encinal, which is 39 miles north on IH-35.

It kind of looked like fire work show or comet but is didn\u2019t have a long tail.  However I could see clearly that it was shooting in a downward direction in a way that I have never seen a firework do.  It also seemed to be too large to be any type of firework.

Hello, I am a witness to a flying saucer,  my buddy already filed a report but my buddy got a call from the lead investigator, who told my buddy for me to make my own report.  So, this is my report. As we were walking our dogs, my buddy decided to drop his dogs off and then go back to my house. As I was waiting outside I wanted to look for the big dipper because it was pretty clear outside.  Then directly overhead I noticed what I thought was a flock of geese in a V pattern.  To my amazement the Geese were not Geese, I was looking at a brilliant V shape set of lights.  I watched them directly and clearly right above me, moving very slow and silent. I could not believe what I was looking at.  It was what I\u2019ve come to know as a UFO.  As soon as I could I called for my friend, come here and look!  As he dashed outside I was pointing straight up at the craft.  He then saw it himself.  We watched, without blinking for about 25-30sec. until the craft traveled out of eyesight. What I saw was seven lights in a triangular formation traveling east at a very slow pace. As it moved away I caught a glimpse of what looked to be more than the V pattern itself, it was a dark circular shape around the lights.  It was HUGE!  At arms length the object was at least 3 inches wide.  It looked, to my perspective that it was at an altitude of one \u2013 two miles.  I could not understand what I was looking at, but I knew it was there (right above us).  Nothing will ever change my mind about what I saw, knowing that it will never be erased from my mind.

      "story": "Daytime sighting on busy freeway, UFO landed. Hello, I am a 27 year old truck driver and My wife is a Registered nurse, we had a sighting a couple sundays ago. This is the first time we have ever seen a ufo.  I was driving my wife to work on Loop 1604 West in San Antonio Texas, Sunday July 27, 2008 at about 13:10. I was driving and she was looking outside the passenger window.  The sky was blue, no clouds in the sky, very sunny. She said she had seen this object  flying to her right, about 200 feet up.  She said she watched it for about a minute before she realized she didn\u2019t know what it was and told me to look at it.  It was hard to see at first because it was sliver and was like a flat egg, it blended in so easily to the sky but I did finally see it and we watched it accelerate to a very fast pace and then slow down again, at this point it was in front of us, over the freeway.  Then it continued a steady pace to our left, and landed.  It went straight down to land, not like an airplane.   I wanted to exit and look for it but my wife did not want to. So we drove on.  It was not a helicopter and it was not an airplane.  We did not see any markings on it.  We did not take any pictures with our phones, when it was happening we were in such disbelief that we didn\u2019t even think of takings pictures of it.  This happened before the 281 highway exit on 1604, it landed behind a Shopping center.  We do not think it was a remote control toy because of the distance it was traveling, the height and the speed is unlike anything we have ever seen.  This location is not near any military base. Has anyone else reported seeing this?",

      "story": "Saw 4-5 bright lights in sky zigzagging up/down and side to side in an extremely fast manner in San Antonio, TX at approx 12:45 am A friend and I were meeting at a parking lot where I was to give her some items after she got off work.  The place we were meeting at was for me a former work place , but one that my friend still works at during the day; the parking lot of the Santiko Embassy theater located off of Bitters Rd near Hwy 281 in San Antonio TX (this location is about a half a mile or less from the San Antonio airport).  The movies had finished and I believe the only cars left were those of the employees still inside. We were standing at our cars just talking when I turned from facing south to the east, and as I looked at the sky I saw lights; as we are near the airport didn\u2019t think anything of it as I just assumed it was one of many planes that fly in and out all hours of the day.  But within what seemed less than a second the light zigzagged not only up and down, but sideways as well.  My first thought was \u201cwhat the heck\u201d, second thought \u201chelicopter\u201d, third thought, \u201chell no they don\u2019t move like that\u201d, then I saw that there was more than one light.  It was partially cloudy and the lights would disappear and appear depending on if they were behind a cloud or not.  Because they did not all disappear and appear around the clouds at the same time it was hard to say if there was more than 4 lights or not.  I was not able to judge the distance or height but it appeared to be higher than the landing or takeoff height of the planes around the area of the airport.  Trying to be logical about what I was seeing I then assumed they were doing something at the airport or at least in the vicinity of the airport, something like floodlights; but to the best of my ability during a cloudy sky flood lights appear to shine off the clouds and of course have a trail of light to lead you to their location, not disappear behind the clouds without once showing a trail of light.  Understand that this all took less than a minute while I was just staring at lights; meanwhile my girlfriend (who was facing north towards me) was still talking.  I then shouted out, \u201cdid you see that\u201d, and of course she said \u201cwhat\u201d.  I pointed up to the area where there was now nothing to see as they appeared to have gone behind the clouds; she again said what when suddenly one then 3 or more appeared and were zigzagging all over that one area.  I again asked if she \u201csaw that\u201d and she replied \u201cyes\u201d, and asked her what she thought they were planes or helicopters, she said no way, they don\u2019t move that way or that fast.  We just kept watching them zigzag extremely fas! t in and out of the clouds but always in the same area.  I thought maybe lights from the planes, but that didn\u2019t make sense as they don\u2019t move that fast or zigzag up and down.  We watched for several minutes and talking excitedly about we thought we might be watching and at this time I checked the time and it was 12:48; I believe I first saw the lights at 12:45 and then my friend said \u201cthis is just to weird I\u2019m leaving\u201d, by this time I myself was getting scared and said \u201cme too\u201d.  Neither of us had a camera; her cell phone had previously be damaged and the screen would only show black, I had a new phone and don\u2019t know how to use it yet but to be honest didn\u2019t even think about it. Since I only first noticed the lights at 12:45am and stopped watching at 12:55am I have no idea how long they might have actually been visible.  At approximately 12:54 I was driving off, went to hwy 281 and headed north towards hill country where I live 3-4 miles outside the city limits on a bluff overlooking the area both south towards Johnson City and north towards the airport and town.  As soon as I got home I went to the highest point near my home to look at the sky but saw nothing but sky, stars, clouds and the lights from the planes flying overhead.  By this time it was about 1:20 and as I tried to calm down and think of what I should do I went onto my computer and went to white pages where I looked up numbers for the airport and non-emergency Bexar County police.  I got in touch with the airport police and asked them if they were doing anything with lights at the airport which they responded no and asked them if anyone had reported seeing lights.  I explained what I saw and he said no one had called, took my name and we said good night.  At least he asked me my name and thanked me for calling, that he would check around, the Bexar county policewoman who took my call asked me nothing, just listened said no when I asked if anyone else had called then thanks for calling and we hung up.  I\u2019m still excited about what I saw and unless someone can tell me that there was some kind of light show going on at this time of the night on a Monday or anything in the least bit believable, I will always believe I saw UFO\u2019s; but they\u2019d have to be pretty convincing, since as I said there was no normal cloud effects with these lights, just extremely fast zigzagging in and out of them.  This morning I got up with the knowledge that I was going to call someone else and report what I saw so I went on line an entered \u201cUFO Sightings\u201d and got you, next I\u2019m going to enter FAA and see if there is a number I can call.  I\u2019m not crazy and in fact worked for 15 years with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority before retiring early and moving to San Antonio.  Please somebody tell me something.",

I was traveling south bound on Jones Malts burger Rd at the intersection of Nakoma near the Blossom Athletic Complex, when I noticed a strange object which I thought was a plane as it was directly over the San Antonio INTL Airport.  It was a cigar shaped craft about the size of a Cessna or leer jet.  It was following the same trajectory that a normal plane would make on approach to landing, however it was not descending.  The object traveled from my left (the west) to my right (the east).  It was a very slow moving object and I watched it for about 1 minute.  The object then turned 90 degrees away from me and traveled south.  When it turned it was like I was looking at the back end of it so it was now circular in shape and had no wings.  The object then seemed to vanish.  It did not speed off, it just kind of de-materialized.  It was almost as if it had gone behind a cloud however the sky was extremely clear and there was no haze present at all.  When I got to a high interchange I looked at downtown San Antonio just to see if there was any sort of haze and there was none.",

I thought it was a flock of birds but it never broke formation and was to perfect of a shape, and there is noway it was a plane because it had no lights or sound, plus a plane flew over, in a different direction, maybe 30 seconds after in which I could hear sound and see blinking lights on it, at a much higher altitude.  Two other people saw the ufo fly over also and none of us have ever seen anything like it before.  Just checking to see if any other reports have came in.

I thought to myself for a few seconds, and remembered that the medical helicopter is white and blue.  I remember thinking that the object didn't look like a helicopter, and that the object didn't appear to be moving toward me or away from me.  I passed a three bridge underpass, and when I looked for it, it was gone.  I looked in the direction of the Medical Center, and I didn't see a helicopter.  I traveled another 2 minutes on the interstate and looked in the direction of where I saw the object and I saw a jet flying through the area.  I thought maybe that's what I had seen, but I remeber that the object was hovering, which a jet can't do.  I was kind of puzzled because nothing like this had happened to me before.  I know that it wasn't a helicopter and I know that it wasn't a jet.  What I saw?  I don't know, but I figured someone else may have seen it also.

      "story": "The object came after me after I tried to take a picture and I think the camera flash caused it all. I was just a few miles outside of San Antonio putting gas in my car and after I left, while at the four way stop I noticed an object in the sky above a field. At first I thought it was a U.S. Border Patrol Helicopter tracking illegals. But then it moves rapidly across the sky. The only way to describe how fast it moved and ca,e to a complete stop, is just like the pointer on the computer when you slide the mouse across the screen.  This gained my interest so i tried to use my cell phone video but I couldn't get anything on the screen. So I just drove towards it and when I got close enough to see what it was, it climbed higher in to the sky where i couldn't make it out. I parked my car and went and got my camera out of the trunk. When I focused on the object I still could see exactly what it was but I could see it flashing it's lights. they went from red to green to blue to yellow then all the colors at the same time. I snapped the picture and as soon as the flash on my camera went off the object started coming closer to me.  At this point I thought the safer place to be was in my car. As the boject got closer it began flashing just like a camera flash. I drove away as fast as I could and then the object passed over my car and disappeared. It was only about a minute later that I saw the object slong side of my car. I only noticed it when it began to flash again. I text my friend and let her know what was going on. By the way, she is the one that gave me this number. Anyway, I took an exit an headed towards Cambleton. I figured I would try and drive to the only store there and just kinda let whatever it was go away. There was nothing open in Cambleton and then I saw the object again just over me and it flashed again. Then I figured the only thing safer to do was to get back on Interstate Highway 37. As I was driving down the road headed back to IH-37, the object was there. This time I saw it. It was at car level and just to my side. It is the strangest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. It looked like a helicopter and the texture of it was just like looking at the pavement on the road but it had a white glow all around it. The object passe me up on the drivers side of my car and went up about 100 yards in front of me. I stopped my car as fast as I could and the object came closer towards me .  I just sat there for a few seconds trying to think of what I was going to do next. I tried to call my friend to tell her what I was facing but my phone would not work at this point. I reversed but the object quickly gained distance between us. So I just put the car in park and said enough is enough. I am a police officer and I always carry my side arm with me so I grabbed it and got out of my car. As I raised my weapon and pointed towards the object, it let out multiple stobes of flash blinding me and I must say the heat was quite intense. So I lowered my weapon since I couldn't see then the flashing stopped. I yelled at the thing while gaining my vision back but all I could hear was my car and nothing else. After a few moments of nothing happening just looking at the thing in front of me not moving just floating idle . I raised my weapon again and the flashing began again and just the same stopped when I lowered it. After gaining my vision back I got back into my car and tried to reverse again. It came towards me and flew over my car then I put my car in drive and drove towards IH-37. The object was nowhere to be seen .  After making it back onto IH-37, I drove for a while and then here was the object again a few minutes later. I stayed with me for about thirty more minutes flashing at me and then going away momentarily back and forth. At this point I made the call to your office and left a message.  Then I came up to a thunder storm and the object just gained altitude and I never saw it again. So after getting home and not really sleeping to much when I did wake up in the morning I noticed I was sun burned. That's my weird story . This isn't in any way a hoax or a joke. In fact I wish it never would have happened. However I do want to get some sort of answer or expalnation as to what it could have been.  Please take this serious and if you can not get me some sort of answer then could you please put me in contact with someone who may have some answers for me.  Thank you.",

I was getting into van to pick-up daughter from dance classes.  I just entered vehicle and was getting ready to start van and observed a bright flash hit the window.  I thought, I had blow car battery or some electrical problem.  I leaned forward and saw an object threw van window. I observed object for a few seconds and exited van.  The object was dark or black and had a rectangular shape. I estimated from a lamppost nearby that the object was about 80 ft above me. It was sort of a large trunk like shape.  It had multicolored lights that were at the ends of what look like rods that projected out from the structure of ship, like needles in a pincushion.  It was about three medium- car lengths long and about two car lengths wide.  It did not emit any sound.  I walked to a parking lot next to my driveway and that object was motionless for about 5 seconds.  The object begin to move in a southeast direction slowly and then made a turn to the northeast and began to rise.  I moved to follow it and went to corner of street and major intersection.  I looked up and down street to see if anyone else was able to see object.  I did not see any persons or vehicles in the area it was very quiet. It then began to move and suddenly seemed to stretch out and then disap! peared from my view into what was northeast direction,  After incident, I went back to my van and attempted to start engine but it would not start and the following day or days I removed battery and took it to nearby car radio and video shop.  The shop guy stated that battery was blow and he noted that battery cables were fused when he returned with new battery to replace blown battery. This craft was beautiful and seemed to just float and move with little effort.  The effect of it stretching out was like observing in going into a tunnel and then it was gone.

We are located at the outer limits of approach aircraft. The object appeared as a bright reflective object, located N30E, approximately 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon.  I was located in our backyard swimming pool, the bright object and relatively stationary appearance caught my attention.   I have seen high flying aircraft, rising party balloon, birds during the daytime.  But this object did not fit those observations.  This object was somewhat stationary and seemed to rise like a balloon, but never this bright and never a shape which seemed to rotate, vary in brightness and shape. Object seemed to hover and slightly rise in the sky until it just vanished.  At one point when the object seemed to nearly disappear, observation what I thought was a much larger triangular object, just catching a straight edge about twenty diameters in length as compared to the bright object (no color, bright white starlike).  It disappeared shortly thereafter.   I looked for it but never saw it again.  The duration of this observation lasted about 15 min.",

The object was moving downwards in a diagonal direction to the right & was moving around in a circular motion while doing this. It was a relatively large object, I wouldn\u2019t say larger than the moon though, maybe half the size of the moon if you were looking at the two side by side in the sky.  It was moving really slow at first so I ran off the porch & snapped a couple of pictures of it on my iPhone.  It looked like it was pretty close to the surface, definitely not the height a plane would be traveling at. It started to pick up speed & soon it vanished behind the trees.  I tried running around the corner to see if I could look through the trees, but didn\u2019t catch any suspicious lights.

As I stared for a few seconds, in the path of my focus was a black rectangle which was moving straight West. The object maintained a steady rotation. It never changed direction or speed as I could not take my eyes off of it.  I have 20/20 vision and I eyeballed that object until it was so far West, it was no longer visible. As I composed myself to keep it together, I looked up at the sky again and WOW! Another exact duplicate black rotating rectangular object following the direct path and speed consistency as the first. As high up as the two objects were, I would estimate about a mile high, they were approximately 15-20 feet in length and thin. Solid black and awesome.  I have only been fascinated by my lucid dreams of flying or having fun in the dreamworld prior to the two objects I witnessed. I am amazed at the thin blue lines before sleep that evolve into symmetric patterns only to be introduced to a diamond grid which is made apparent by the unseen force behind it. A presence or Some &quot;thing&quot; is swooshing cursive-like gleaming, sparkling, glowing, shimmering communication. Hard to believe is not my concern, I simply do not understand exactly.  I also have had a black triangle become apparent in my presleep light show. I am used to the star cluster normal activity when the eyelids are closed. But just a few days ago, I was messing around with concentration and the ultra violet or purple clusters opened up in the center and formed a black triangle. THEN, a star or spark appeared in the exact center. Wow, then I see those two black rectangles in the sky?? I have NEVER messed with acid or mushrooms. Been weird forever it seems.",

      "story": "70 to 115 Red-Orange balls of light traveling in a line across the skies over San Antonio, TX Myself and 2 friends of mine were sitting in my friends front yard when he noticed something in the skies, I turned and looked and observed red-orange fireballs of light moving across the sky, when my friend noticed them, about 15 to 20 of these must have already passed, I stood and began counting these objects and asking for a camera, nobody had one, I  counted to 73 before I stopped counting and began simply observing them and trying to figure out what I was seeing. Another 50 or so must have gone by, one following another in a slanted but straight line, as if afixed to a wing, but I could see stars through them so they must not have been attached to anything. My friends and I had the eerie feeling that they were observing us observing them.  My friends neighbor, an elderly lady came home and she observed the lights as well, he then went in his house to call out his sister who also came out and observed the lights. The lights went across the sky from North to South, once the lights reached the end of the horizon they seemed to &quot;blink out&quot;.  Once one blinked out, another would appear on the north side horizon.  After about 20 minutes of this the last light appeared and followed the rest, from the rear of the last light it seemed as if a corner of a wing could be seen, yet, invisible.  Over the years I've seen UFO's before, but never anything on this scale, the sheer number of the objects was staggering. This was a major event, and yet, nobody repoted it.  Execpt me.  Hopefully others will come forward about this.  Thank you.",

During the mid to late 1970's between midnight to 0200 hours I was standing on our back patio on the Southside of San Antonio looking up at the night sky. It was a clear late summer / early fall evening.  Out of the North flying South was a bright flying object. It took me a couple of seconds to realize that if wasn't a jet or an airliner.  I was between 9 - 10 years old. I was and still am a huge science fiction fan. It wasn't the USS Enterprise or a Klingon Battlecruiser.  That would have been cool.  This was better!  The object was roundish to almost egg shaped. It had window's all around the sides. But only in the middle of the craft.  But they went all around the craft. The craft did spin but it also spun from end to end. If it had ends.  Hard to explain. There were no other craft in the sky. I was so enthralled it didn't occur to me to wake up my parents.  Looking back the object probably would've been gone by the time my folks would've gotten out of bed. Well! that's my story from my only UFO encounter of my life.  I'm now a former US Army MP and a 3 time OIF veteran.  I'm now a civilian police officer at Fort Sam Houston.  Also 80% disabled by the VA.

      "story": "Two UFOs photographed in full daylight, one punched a cookie-cutter shape in a cloud I am an attorney residing in the Northwestern US. I was vacation visiting a close friend at the time of this incident. I was taking a photo of the Chik-fil-A billboard at the intersection of Interstate Highway 10 and DeZavala Road in San Antonio and didn't realize until after I got home that I had photographed a UFO. Two UFOs, actually.  (The reason I was taking the photos was because I thought the billboard was somewhat humorous.)  I took a total of 10 photos starting at 4:56:12 pm, as I was departing the Taco Cabana drive through on Interstate Highway 10 and traveling toward DeZavala Road. The UFO doesn't appear in any photos until 4:57:57 pm, and was gone by 4:58:05 pm.  I have a total of three and possibly four photos that show one or both UFOs. The first photo shows two UFOs, one above the billboard and one in the bottom right quadrant, behind a tree. The second photo shows a UFO in the upper center and \"cookie cutter\" type hole the cloud, in the same size and shape of the UFO, and a second UFO now emerged from behind a tree in the bottom right quadrant of the photo. If you look at the photos closely, there are also some smaller, lighter grey dots that are hovering in an arc--possibly circular formation--around the UFO in the top center of the first two photos. This was not something on my windshield or camera.  If you enlarge the photos, in one image, you can see the overhead powerline in front of the UFO and the tree in front of the second UFO. Again, I didn't know I had photographed anything until hours later. I am willing to share additional photos, if you need them, taken before and after the photos that show the UFOs.  I am also willing to discuss the circumstances under which I took the photos and answer any questions that you might have.",

I noticed 6 objects to the left of me that looked bright fire red in the sky.  The objects were formed in a triangular shaped with one of the objects in the center, the other 2 objects were to the right of the triangular shape one atop of the other.  Not moving just at a stand still.  Couldn't been a plane or helicopter I told my girlfriend if she can see what I was seeing.  She then was just as curious as I was, she told me to exit Hwy 151, and I then proceeded onto Ingram Rd.  By then the objects began to move in a slow pace parting from each other. The skies were cloudy and a light mist, couldn't have been chinese lanterns,  we then parked our vehicle in a suburban area, which the objects the began to disappear one by one into the clouds traveling towards the west in a very slow speed.   We then researched after and there have been actual eyewitness of the same objects we spotted.   We do believe it was an actual UFO sighting without a doubt.   No blinking lights so this couldn't have been an aircraft.",

After focusing the object I see the shape is a teardrop yellow bright light in the center and the outer edges seem to emit red and green lights slightly changing the shape to little cylinders coming off the lower part of the teardrop.  I stared at it for some time trying to figure what the heck it was - it seem almost gaseous looking the greens and reds seemed to be changing the outer layer. Very odd.  So I went inside and called a friend then after a while went back outside again and the object had moved several houses down the street in distance...  Now on the other side of the street at rooftop level again in the distance was another light that emitted red, blue green and yellow at a rapid pace but much smaller size and circular but very colorful like a xmas tree.  Wow two ufo sightings in one night and its only March!  I see lots of different odd things in the sky and I see planes a lot too but these two objects did not make any noise.  I don't believe satellites look like this nor do they hover so low in the sky.  The constellations were way up in the atmosphere so I know they were not stars.

It was round with green lights one one side but it had red lights on the other side of it, it flashed in both colors, at first my sister claimed it was the news filming the event, but the people including myself said that not a helicopter, it maneuvered across than accented up and than down, it turned and began trailing back. This isn't the first time I recorded this red and green flashing light UFO.  Last year, on Fourth of July, I recorded a craft with this same descriptions at a fireworks display going off.

I was on my way to an afternoon appointment, and I stopped at my subdivision's entrance, which intersects a very busy street in the Stone Oak area.  It was a typical South Texas day, hot as hell, and clear blue, but for a couple dark clouds.  We're in big sky country and I just glanced up as a I waited for a break in traffic to merge and I saw plane flying from east to west. No, not a plane.  That's not a plane.  I'm used to seeing aircraft in San Antonio, with all the army bases.  I know what most large military craft look like and they also fly very low.  But this was different.  This was cigar shaped kind of like a sleek Zeppelin, silver, no lights, no visible insignia. I'm watching traffic I think.  There's no one behind me so I lose many opportunities to merge so I can continue to identify the flying object I've become so drawn to.  I wonder if anyone else can see it. It's not a plane.  It's not a military plane or drone.  It's flying low enough to see it's not a plane.  It's just cruising and I'm watching it and it flies right into the only dark cloud in the very bright blue sky and never comes out the other end. Not possible. I don't pull over.  I don't want to know.  No one is behind me still and I merge into traffic and begin to drive but keep my eyes on the cloud.  The cloud remains and the object never comes out the other end. I stop at a near light and the object still doesn't come out. I'm stopped next to McDonalds.  The object still doesn't come out. That's not a plane. It's not normal but I need to keep moving.  I know I do.  I keep my appointments, I tell my immediate family and it's just another unexplained sighting that they think is really cool but dismiss after dinner. When I was younger, I didn't know any better and would report these sightings to police.  Now I know to report some to UFO centers and keep moving.  I am surprised by this one though, that it didn't make the news, that no one saw it.  It was so huge in such a bright sky, the middle of the day.  I don't think anyone saw it.  I saw the world go on like normal. I don't think they all saw it.  I don't know how they couldn't have.  It flew into that dark cloud and that was it, its tomb, it never came out.",

It was flying at a normal airplane speed.. maybe a little slower and produced no sound.  About a minute later I see a second object flying from the same direction..  It to goes by then a third, a fourth..  I watch ten orange fireballs go by.  They were flying at different altitudes and distances, some are larger some smaller and have slightly different 'shape'.  The tops produced a slight halo of a lighter shade of orange.   I ran into the house and grabbed my iphone and came back outside in time to film the final one go by.  I think it was 11 total but it may have been 12.  It was like a ufo parade.  Very strange.  I'm certain others must have seen it as they flew across the whole of east and north San Antonio.

I have been around aircraft for over 28 years with the Air Force and my current position as an aircraft mechanic with Boeing Aerospace.

Several months after the 2/21/18 poster shared her sightings with me, I woke up at about 2 a.m.  I live directly below the original poster.  While laying on the couch, I could see out my blinds across the abandoned yet improved adjacent property.  I could see through the blinds three very bright lights . . . in close formation.  The lights appeared to change in colors and I do recall a red light and a very bright cold blue light.  I know I saw what I saw \u2013 I even got up off my couch and walked out onto my balcony.  The lights/device/thing was probably 100 yards away \u2013 to the North \u2013 and appeared to be about treetop height \u2013 approximately 60 feet in the air.  I kept staring at whatever it was.  With a few exceptions, it remained stationary.  My initial thought was \u201cdrone.\u201d  My second thought was \u201cdrone flown by some pervert trying to look into our apartment windows.\u201d  But it was all too weird. Look \u2013 I have a graduate degree.  I\u2019m 48 years old.  I love science.  I consider myself pretty sharp and definitely not hysterical.  I dig on the scientific method and I get that the simplest explanation is often the correct one.  But . . . based on operational logistics and the location of the observation, something was strange and inexplicable.  I saw what I saw \u2013 it got my chalupa eating hiney off the couch and onto the patio for a better view.  It was too large to be a drone.  Plus \u2013 why at 2 a.m.  . . . over a very abandoned but secure retirement community???  If someone were flying a drone, they would \u201cfly it\u201d . . . as in it should move . . . instead it hovered for like 15 minutes til it simply disappeared with no change in elevation. Very strange. I would be interested to know whether my location was the same as an earlier poster above from April 2019 who reported seeing an object while with her fianc\u00e9e.  I wonder if that occurred in the same area/location. I saw what I saw.  I was intrigued enough to go outside for a better look.  My upstairs neighbor has seen similar objects.  Weird.",

      "story": "Was driving home, heading south on Commercial Avenue, on the south side of San Antonio.  We noticed a large flash of light in the south eastern part of the sky.  Each flash was blue in color.  Flashes lasted only a few seconds, but continued for several minutes around the San Antonio River and Loop 410 area.  There was no accompanying sound, smoke or any reports of electrical power being lost.  The flashes light up the entire portion of the sky.  There was a gas main that caught fire, but it was reported at 0100 hrs a full 5 hours after these flashes were observed.",

      "story": "Aliens walking into the Bank , conducting bank transaction, and walking out. I am an experienced retail banker with over 12 years of experience in Mortgage Lending/Branch banking. I have my bachelors degree in business management, and I have clear vision and of sound mind.  My co-workers who are also close friends of mine are witnesses as well. There are about 5 of us who have this conversation annually so I wanted to report this information.  Once a month in 2014, a family- who we are convinced are aliens disguised as humans -would enter our bank branch and cash small checks. Prior to my encounter, When my co-workers would tell me about a family that would come into our branch and looked like aliens, I would laugh it off.  However, I encountered them twice and I changed my mind.  When we tell people our story, it sounds crazy to outsiders.  The family would captivate your attention the second they would walk into the bank. There were 5 people in the \"family\".... a \"dad\", \"mom\", and \"three daughters\". All three daughters appeared to be teenagers and the same exact height. Both parents were the same exact height. They were ash/grayish in color, and their heads were shaped like inverted triangles and their heads formed cone-ish towards the back. This was more prominent on the dad as he was completely bald. The women had short, blond-ish hair. Their garments were always drab. The Parents were an estimated 5 foot 3 inches. the kids, 5 foot 1 inch.  What was interesting about them was they would walk into the bank in a single file line. Their legs would walk together military-like and in unison, and their energy captured all of the attention of everyone in the bank, including our bank customers. People had a hard time keeping their eyes off of them.  The dad came directly to my teller line and was a foot in front of me. His eyes matched the rest of the family- dark, large pupils, and I felt like he was staring into my mind. I can't explain it. The family stood directly behind him and stared at me the entire transaction as well, without saying a word. The father had a muffled English voice. Once the transaction was over, the family turned and walk in a single file line out of the branch.  This happened an additional time that I can recall, but the dad did not come to my teller line. However, the family had everyones attention throughout the entire transaction once again.  This happened a few times, and all of my friends can recall up to 4 separate times they entered the branch.  None of us can remember their names, their accounts, or anything. We never thought to take a picture. The only reason I can give as to why we didn't document it, was because of the attention they grabbed from us, and how shocked we were after each encounter. It was strange and indescribable.  They all wore red garments.",
