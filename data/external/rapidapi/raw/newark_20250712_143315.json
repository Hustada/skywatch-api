      "story": "Two very bright lights seen in the sky before vanishing, one seen a second time in a different location several minutes later Last Saturday evening, the 15th of December, I was running some errands. I was on my way from my apartment to my place of work to pick up my paycheck (about a 5 minute drive.) I was alone in the car. There are two ways to get to my work, and if I had chosen the way that I usually prefer to take, I may not have seen what I saw that night. I thought that this other way would be quicker though, so I went that way. I almost made the light at the intersection of Wyoming Road (which I was on, facing east) and Marrow's Road, but it turned red just before I got there, so I was stopped for a few minutes waiting to make a left turn. To the south (my right side) of this intersection is a large suburban residential area. To the northwest (roughly behind me) is a shopping center. Directly east (in front of me) is a large warehouse of some kind, and slightly to the northeast of that building is a highly visible chemical factory building with large smokestacks (which I always jokingly call \"those pretty cloud machines.\") I don't think there was anyone else stopped at the intersection. The sky that night was completely overcast; not a single star could be seen anywhere. The sun had set, so it was fully nightttime, but because of the cloud cover bouncing back the light pollution it was relatively light outside. So I was sitting at the red light and just looking ahead of me, when I saw two very bright, circular or spherical white lights come out of nowhere in the eastern sky, above the warehouse. I thought they must be planes at first, and Delaware does have an airport somewhat nearby with occasionally low-flying planes, but these objects were hovering and not traveling in a straight trajectory. The lights on them were also much brighter than on a plane. It was difficult to tell exactly how far away from me they were, and I did not hear any noise. The two lights were close together at first. The one on the right remained stationary in the sky, and its light was stable. The one on the left was blinking on and off, and moved slowly to the left (north.) I got the feeling that the stationary one was in some way controlling the movements of the other one. As I watched this I realized they were not ordinary aircraft, and it seemed that the instant I thought this, the lights stopped moving for a second and then gradually retreated back behind the thick cloud cover. From my perspective, it looked like they faded out before disappearing. I had the distinct impression that they had been aware I was watching, and the whole thing spooked me out. The traffic light turned green and I continued on my way, trying to analyze what had happened and think of any other possible explanations. I was mad that I had forgotten to take out my camera, but I was so shocked by what I was seeing and it was over very quickly (the lights were visible for maybe 20-30 seconds or so total.)  After picking up my paycheck, I went to my mother's house, which is in a residential neighborhood off of Kirkwood Highway. As I pulled onto her street (again facing east) I saw just one of these same bright white lights. The light was not blinking, so I assumed it was the non-blinking one I had seen before (it looked exactly the same), but it could have been the blinking one from before or possibly a third craft. I pulled into my mom's driveway while continuing to watch the light, which was still just moving slowly around in the sky, hovering. I looked at the clock so at least I would know exactly what time it was on this second sighting...it was 6:41 pm. Now I thought of my camera and fished around in my purse for it, but was unable to locate it. (I had taken it out a couple nights before to take pictures of something else and never put it back.) I kept watching the light, and again it was like the craft knew I was watching and conspiring to take pictures of it. Suddenly, the bright light was shut off, but I could still see three very dim lights in a triangular pattern in its place. The lights were (I think) red/pink, blue/green, and yellow/orange. This triangular formation then moved to the left (north) and disappeared behind a house. That was the last I saw of it. When I got home that night, I drew pictures of what I had seen and jotted down the details. I looked up the locations where I saw these craft on Mapquest, and I was definitely looking almost directly east both times. I am a college student in my senior year, and I work part time in customer service. I was not under the influence of any intoxicants at the time. I believed in UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence before, but now I am even more sure that they exist. I am not sure that what I saw could not have been explained by man-made technology, but I can't shake the feeling that they knew I was watching and altered their movements because of it.",

I woke up one morning and looked out the bedroom window and saw a saucer like craft with a raised dome on top.  It had a white outline highliting it.  I watched it going towards the direction of Fort Worth Tx.  I noticed it would go thru some of the clouds so I knew it was real.  I turned to yell for my mom and rest of the family but by the time I looked back out the window, I saw it dissapear back into clouds and it was gone. I never thought much of it anymore until I saw a program on UFO's and they had talked about an event where they had tracked a UFO across areas of Texas during that time frame of my childhood  and when they showed the actual tracking on TV, I was amazed to see it had gone near Newark and was headed to and flown in thier airspace at Carswell AFB.  I know for a fact that what I saw as a kid in Newark Tx. was and is real. I couldn't believe I had proof in my mind of what I saw that early morning.

I was in my living room, sleeping near sliding doors and it was a very clear night.  I looked up a star chart just so I wouldn't make a mistake here.  Facing south/southeast, about 30-35 degrees above the horizon, a very bright white light was hovering over the tree line.  It almost looked like the northern star, but was 100 times more brilliant.  The object was far off in the distant, but after observing it for about 20-25 minutes, it made a very slow, controlled movement toward the south (left to right), not by much.  Very very small, slow movements.  The object continued to hover for about 50-60 minutes.  My wife came out of the bedroom, because she claimed she could not sleep either.  She observed it as well, and as a science teacher, she was curious also.  After about an hour, the object took a straight upward, controlled increase in elevation, starting out very slow and then increasing upward at a faster rate of speed, until object lost site into the stratosphere and further upward into what appeared to be outer space.  Object was looked for throughout the early morning hours and the next evening, but was not seen again.  I think it's safe to say this wasn't a weather balloon or meteor; military!  I also might note that there is a local airport with very little traffic nearby, however, this airport also houses military aircraft for soldier transports, usually to and from Iraq.  Furthermore, these aircraft are incapable of going straight upward and also do not have the ability to hover for hours at a time, for all you skeptics. Make your own opinion. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

It would flash a light every second for three seconds and at the third second count it would hold for a longer period of time become very bright and then dim away for a few seconds before starting again. It then seemed to turn and move up and to the left. It stayed in that place and continued blinking and then it would seem to go far away and then appear again. I ruled out any chance of it being a star or an aircraft and after doing this and moving quickly to different positions it stopped completely and went out of sight.

There was a large part with 2 smaller parts separated but close to it, these smaller parts seemed to move away from the large part, then return (I think that is the reason for the twinkle effect).  The orange looking \"array\" kept moving to the North but slowly, and always kept it's same configuration. These were visible from 4:30am to 5:15 am.  Video was taken at high zoom and some clear images were obtained for a few seconds. These objects seemed to be just moving North very slowly and made no sudden moves or speed changes.  I would estimate people from northern MD to NY could have seen this, but I have seen no reports on the news as of today (9/6/09). There were some clouds in the sky and a full moon was behind me as I traveled north.  I wish I had thought to get my camera out sooner as the orange object(s) were huge when first seen.  When I did manage to snap pics distance became a factor. I the orange array was the Goodyear Blimp, I'd say it was 2 miles in front of me when first seen, maybe 10 miles out when filmed. The white array, which I thought at first was Venus or a star, always \"seemed\" to be 20 miles or maybe thousands of miles away, and never seemed to get closer or farther away. With the naked eye, I would have to conclude the white thingy was a star, but after looking at the video I have to rule that out.  Naked eye on the orange \"array\" was never thought to be anything other than an array of dim, orange-ish lights grouped together.",

But in the distance i could see a set of lights near or on the top of another hill.....i once again assumed it was just a house with the lights on, but as we coasted down the hill i noticed that the position of the lights were moving vertically in comparison to us as we made our way down the hill.....at this point i had stoppd the car and rolled down the window to look more clearly .....what i saw at first was just what appeared to be a disk with a very low intensity orangish light emmiting from the entire craft....but just as soon as i focused in on it the object began to move diagonaly towards the feild below...as it moved the orange glow slowly faded to white and then the light seperated itself int seven seperate light orbs that pulsed..now from the angle i was at i could not see it all to well now.....so i went to drive the car around the corner but the car had turned itself off. the key was still in the ignition and i attempted to restart it but there was no resonse. even the electronics were unresponsive...now at this time i looked back up and saw that the object moved over towards my car......not over top of me but close enough....at this time i realized it was not a disk because even though the lights where in a disk shape formation, when it crossed paths with the moon you could see the moon in the center of all the lights....as the lights began to ascend upwards, the lights slowley turned orange once again........then out of no where my car started........when i looked back up at the object it was a brite violet and it took of.......my radio did not work for weeks after the inccident.............when i went home ! every cl ock had said it was 10:52........but both my car and cellphone clock read 22 minutes faster....",

The object appears to be a sphere with flickering multi color lights from the distance that i am viewing it from. I knw its not a plane or a star for the simple fact that an actual airplane would pass by and you could clearly tell the diffrence from it and you could tell the diffrence from a star for the simple fact its the only object flickering multi color lights and the stars around it are as normal as they should be. I tried video taping it but my camera would simply not reach the distance. The object would move at a steady but slow pace, and judging from the distance of my view it would ruffly move 5 inches south every 5-10 minutes. I see this object every nigh! t and it does worry me.

Although I do not believe the noise is related, I somehow felt the need to look out my window.  I pulled the blinds back and noticed a white hazy object, hovering above the treeline across the street from where I live.  The object was at a distance of anywhere between 5-7 miles away.  It was a particularly clear night and the stars were out.  It was a white light moving in a small circlular patter, very eratically.  I stared in disbelief and then walked outside to observe.  It was very quiet.  The object hovered for about 3 minutes off to the west and then suddenly shot directly to the north very rapidly, maintaining altitude and distance.  I continued to observe the light for about another minute, before it shot off at an amazing speed toward the north, northeast.",

      "story": "Multiple witnesses of 2 flying disks in Newark, DE on 08/29/10 While driving to the Christiana Mall in Newark today, I noticed two metallic disks flying rather close to one another. They were absolutely silent and moved slightly sporadically.  The disks were spinning, but not on a perfect axis.  They were not in sync, but they stayed relatively close to one another for the approximate two minutes in which I observed them. It seemed as though they were moving closer and they flew higher extremely fast.   From my perspective, it seemed as if they flew straight up into the sky. I was able to keep an eye on the objects the whole time until I had to travel below an overpass and I lost sight of the objects, which were very far away the last time I had my eye on them. I was a passenger in a car with two other people, who both observed the objects.  Traffic notably slowed down on the exit ramp, as I assume that other drivers noticed them as well. When the car I was in parked at the mall, I got out and saw an unmarked plane, and I am! not sure if it had any relation to the UFO sighting I had witnessed minutes before.   The sighting did not have any physical effects on me or on any of the other passengers in the car that I was traveling in.  As one who takes particular interest in UFOs I was absolutely speechless to observe the sighting, and it has left a traumatizing mental effect, as the images I saw have been in my head the whole day. I am very curious as to whether or not anybody else reported the sighting.",

      "story": "Single orange light moving very fast W to E My husband and I went onto our back deck to let the dogs out.  We noticed the sound of an airplane, the small kind that only one or two people can sit in.  We noticed a bright orange light moving very quickly over us in a straight line West to East.  At first we thought it was the plane we heard, but as it sped across the sky, we realized it wasn't.   This object had no blinking lights.  It was bright, like the size of Venus on an early spring morning, but orange in hue.  With a full moon tonight, the clouds were illuminated, and this object was flying beneath them.  It was out of sight within 15 seconds, miles and miles away, but we still heard that biplane somewhere, so we know that the object was something else entirely.   The object was never obscured by houses or trees at any point. It either disappeared, or was simply so fast it was hundreds of miles away in mere seconds.  I am a very logical thinker, and I cannot imagine what, in my index of known objects, this was.   Moments after, a commercial plane flew in from another direction. It was blinking and went behind the clouds. The UFO was, without a doubt, not an airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "Orange Triangle shaped craft My girlfriend and I were walking outside, around 11pm at night. Usually when she leaves my home she we\u2019re outside talking for a few minutes before she leaves. Normally, I always like to look into the sky check out stars I can see, planets, or constellations. On this night I noticed the craft moving at a very common speed in comparison to Earth aircraft. This craft was triangle in shape.  This object had absolutely no sound and was moving in one direction from North-west direction to a South-East direction. This object was at a height of a private passenger plane. It was so apparent in the sky in contrast to the background of the night that my girlfriend had no problem recognizing the craft immediately when I pointed out to her. The glow on the bottom side of the craft had what I would only describe as a \u201cdusk\u201d orange on the bottom side of the craft. The shape can best described as a stealth bomber.  The only recording device I had on me at the time was my iphone 3g and I snapped some pictures when it was already out of view. I am attaching the ones I believe are the photos from that night. I am more than experienced to realize that this is not Mars and was no known aircraft I've ever seen in the area. As regular commercial jets fly around our area often and can normally be heard. Whereas this particular object had absolutely no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Two silvery-white circular shaped craft appeared to use a cloaking technology to reappear and disappear. Hello. I am the same guy that reported the sighting on August the 2nd after leaving the Glasgow Park. This time I was on the deck of my backyard during the brewing of the late afternoon thunderstorms that were quickly covering Northern Delaware around 5-6 PM Eastern Time.  I was sitting on my deck watching the clouds swirl as there appeared to be one frontal system coming from a Southwestern direction that was bisected by another from a Southeastern direction.  As I stand on my deck watching the clouds move with grace and speed, I noticed in the distance at what appeared to be a great altitude, maybe that of what you would typically see inbound and outbound flights appear at, but just under the main cloud layer that was forming. They were a silvery white colored and my initial thought in trying to recognize what these 2 objects were is that it may have been 2 seagulls flashing their white underbelly as the sung shines a reflection from it to my direction. Howe! ver, what happened next lead me to believe these were not birds or traditionally inbound, outbound passenger airliners as they disappeared as if they were cloaking for 2 seconds and then they reappeared in the next breath to only disappear for good after a few more seconds (another 2 to 3).  They were flying in the general direction that the storm system was heading, a Northeastern direction (they were following the frontal system that was coming from the southwest).   Both of these objects were far from where I was standing, from what I could tell but they were tightly grouped together. They did not zig or zag, they merely were flying in what appeared from my parallax as a straight pattern toward a northeast direction. Maybe due to the sunlight's distortion or other exogenous factors, the crafts appeared to be silver at first but then they appeared to be more of a pure white color. I did not see any flashing lights, just merely the objects themselves. And as for the shape o! f the craft, they were a spherical or circular fit. I did not ! see any visible wings, but that does not mean there weren't any wings b/c from my vantage point, I was quite far. The reason I decided to report this is b/c of the peculiar cloaking and reappearing nature of these crafts. I have never seen any aircraft ever do this to my knowledge. As to the specifics of weather, it was not quite raining yet, it was cool outside due to the coming frontal system, daylight was still visible although it was quickly dimming due to the dark cloud systems forming, and this is my 2nd late evening sighting within 3 days. Also, the objects left no visible contrails and I did not hear any audible jet or engine noise.",

I waited for it to reappear out of the glare of the light, but it never did.

It was aprox. 9:50 pm and I had turned off a main road (busy with traffic on to a side street.  Out of the corner of my left eye I saw an orange sphere shaped object in the sky.  It had interested me because of the shear size of the sphere.  (if you were to hold a penny as far out with your left hand it appeared to he that size ).  As I'm driving I am still looking at this object when I notice another of the same objects appeared. Now 2 sphere shaped glowing orange Ufos were in my sight by hey began a theater totter motion as one went up the other went down.  At this time I pulled to a stop sight from the side street I was on which was still only about 250 ft from the main road.  The spheres dimmed in color as I pulled ou! t my iPhone to capture about 40 seconds of video. After recording this I had called a friend to explain what was still before my eyes and I began to drive towards the objects.  The opposite direction of my delivery.  As I came to another stop light the objects dissipated into the sky.",

But he distinctly saw 8 orange, dull colored lights in the distance and could not hear any noise, then they all started to disappear one by one.   This happened approximately at 9 PM Eastern Standard time during a dingy colored full moon on a clear night. Temperature is in the 80s at the time with about 95% humidity.  There were more mosquitoes than average out tonight and I recall some strange activity among animals in the area. This actually reminds me now of a sighting I saw myself about 2 or 3 months ago while driving towards Wilmington on 95 North, probably a few miles from exit 7. I remember driving and seeing a strange rotating craft appear on my right with 3 distinct lights, it was hard to see, but it appeared that one of the lights was changing colors from red to green and I had my windows down but I could not hear any distinct afterburner sounds.  I was driving most likely around 70-75 mph and I lost the craft as trees began to appear in the foreground.  I have also witnessed strange crafts/lights in the Florida area.",

      "story": "3 Black Triangular Objects flying silently overhead. On the night of November 15th 2014, there were low clouds and I estimate the ceiling to be approximately 400 ft.   I was sitting in my Spa in my back yard, when I noticed a redish yellow light flying low and slow.  It appeared to be pulsing or rotating.  It looked more like a flame than a navigation light.   Then I noticed two more that appeared to be flying in formation with the first. Because of the cloud cover, I could not make out the aircraft that were displaying the lights, but my first thought was that it was a formation of Helicopters.  As they approached, however, I was struck by the lack of any noise.   As the lights were directly overhead, they extinguished.  The lights had been flying SE to NW, but about 30 seconds after they went out, I saw a large, black, triangular object flying (or floating) very slowly moving in a Northerly direction.  It appeared to be about the size of a C-17 at about 400 ft in altitude, but was of a triangular shape.  It was in complete view below the clouds, and I could see the shape perfectly.   My first impression was that it was a Stealth Fighter, but after a couple of seconds, I realized that the trailing edge was perfectly smooth, unlike the jagged edge of a Stealth Aircraft.  Add the very slow movement and the complete silence, and I realized that this was like nothing that I have ever seen.    I watched the object as it flew over my house, and it appeared to be dropping something like a parachute.  At that time, I saw 2 more lights appear from the SE, and they extinguished at about the same point as the others had.   I then saw 2 more of the Black, Triangular objects on the same flight path as the first one.  I lost sight of them as they flew over my house.   From the time that I saw the first lights to the time that I saw the third object fly over my house, was about 4 to 5 minutes in duration.

      "story": "Trianular shaped, silent aircraft with pulsing white lights silently and quickly passed over top in Newark, DE. Pulling onto my street, around 9:30pm on April 15th, 2015, which is located in a very nice and quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of Newark, Delaware, by the border of Pennsylvania, I happened to look to the left in the west and up into the sky as I usually do, driving home.   I noticed some bright and what I thought were distant lights moving slowly towards my direction eastward.    My first thought was that it was a commercial airliner coming straight towards where is was on Bristol Lane in Cotswold Hills.  I don\u2019t usually see lights this bright or commercial airliners for that matter moving in this direction over top of my neighborhood which slightly sparked my interest. The  PHI Airport is a little over 35 miles NE from me and I do see lots of air traffic at night when skies are clear and this was a clear night.   The Dover Air Force Base is about 50 miles south of me. As I looked up and saw the aircraft, I thought is was far away and might have been low flying because it didn\u2019t appear to be high in the sky.  I was still driving and slowed to stop and watch the aircraft as I saw it approaching fairly quickly.  Within about 30 seconds of spotting it in the distance, it was now almost right on top of where I was.   I quickly rolled the windows down, shut the car off, and stuck my head out of the window to listen for any engine noises.  I heard nothing.  It was still silent outside.  Looking up I could now see that this craft had three large randomly pulsing white lights underneath of it with one red light in the center.  The white lights were not all pulsing at the same time.  They were pulsing independently of each other.  The red light was a solid and consistent brightness.  As the craft went directly over top of me I noticed it was still making no noise at all.  My neighborhood is very quiet and I can usually hear, jets, propeller p! lanes and helicopters.  There is a farm field behind my neighborhood and no bright shopping centers or main roads are very close to me to create noise or light pollution. Looking straight up I also noticed that the body of the craft is in the definite shape of a large dark triangle because it blocked out the sky in that area which was full of stars this night.  I also noticed now that it was moving very quickly because it was very far away at first but within seconds it was on top of me.  As it went overhead, I could see one more small red like in the very back center of the triangle.  It quickly, silently passed over top of me and over the house to my immediate right.  Still no noise at all.  I put my head back into the car and started it up again and then quickly pulled forward to track the object after it was blocked by the house.   When I saw the object again, which was only about 5 seconds later, it was very far away moving in the same eastern direction.  It might have been at least a mile away at that point and quickly and steadily moved away and out of sight in the next minute until I couldn\u2019t see it at all anymore.  That was the last I saw of it.",

On July 24, 2017, both my wife and I woke up around 2:30 am with loud thunders from lightning.  As we tried to sleep, we heard a few more thunders around the Drummond North area.   Then, suddenly, we heard a loud sound and the intensity of that sound was increasing and decreasing periodically with a time period of 2 or 3 seconds.  Our ears were able to detect that periodic nature of the sound.  Then a bright orange beam of light entered our room through a window.  The intensity of that orange light became brighter and darker in synchronization with ups and downs of the loudness of the sound.  As this event was unfolding, we both thought that lightning might have started fire at a power transformer somewhere.  So, I asked my wife to call 911, and I ran to the window. After removing the curtain of a window, I saw that a cylindrical structure hanging between our house and a neighbor\u2019s house at a height of about 40 to 50 feet above my window.  The approximate size of that cylindrical structure could be about 5 feet in height and 2 feet in diameter.  That structure was generating both the sound and the light beams, and their intensities were modulated synchronously.  The sound had the characteristics of running a huge blower whose speed was changing periodically in a very controlled manner.  The light was so intense that at its peak value that I was getting blinded by it.  Our backward was lighted up as if the sun\u2019s rays on a clear midday have become orange and pulsing. As I tried to look directly at that cylindrical surface, I could only see some window-like features on that structure when the light intensity was low.  The beam of light was practically coming from all over the structure.  Instead of calling 911, my wife was so puzzled by the event that she unknowingly ran to another window and witnessed that bewildering event. Suddenly, the whole thing stopped.  That cylindrical structure just disappeared in front of my eyes, and the world around us appeared to be the same as before.  Approximately, whole event took probably between 15 to 20 seconds to unfold. I realized later that while that event was progressing, not a single dog barked in our area. We do not have a dog, but all of our neighbors do, and their dogs will bark even if a moderately loud car enters our area at night. In the morning when I was looking up and tried to identify the area where I saw that cylindrical structure, I realized that there is no electrical or any other overhead line has gone through that area or close to that area.  The trees around that area have no burning sign, at all.   As if nothing has happened last night.",

As my daughter was driving us home from shopping last night through White Clay Creek State Park, we noticed some strange lights in the sky, but they were too far away to tell what was going on.  Once we got closer, we noticed they weren't really moving very fast.  As we neared the object we realized it was not a plane and it was directly overhead of us.  The object was HUGE!  It was diamond shaped and each point had a light on it. It hovered above the trees very slowly but was moving.  We could not believe what we were seeing!  It was making a strange wah wah sound.  As it was going in the opposite direction we were, we decided to turn around and follow it.  We turned around and could not locate it. It was gone!  We drove around for quite some time to try to locate it and as slow as it was going, we should have been able to easily find it, but we did not.",
