Object was very high in the sky and looked like 50 satellites combined into one large UFO.  This object was by far the largest I have seen in my life.  I am 50 years old. It was moving very fast and completely silent.  It wasn't skipping across our atmosphere and it didn't appear to be burning.  This UFO never changed in color.  The color was a bright soft white color.  There was no colored lights blinking indicating that it was an aircraft.  After about 45 seconds it vanished from full brightness to nothing.  My 18 year old son was with me.  I will never forget what I saw last night.  I tried to video with my phone and couldn't zoom in to get a good video.  I did try and saved what I have.",

      "story": "In the early morning hours of July 27th, 2019.  I witnessed between 3 and 6 lights that moved consistantly accross the sky as if they were Satellites.  These lights would appear moments after visually seeing what appeared to be a shooting star which each appeared to me to be leaving the orbit as opposed to entering it.  When following each of these lights from one side to the other, there would then be a shooting star at a 45 degree angle outward that would happen.  This same thing happened 3 clear times.  There were other high flying US planes to compare speed, trajectory etc. as well.  Locater in the PNW, I was facing westerly centering myself with a bright star I later determined to be Zenith.  The more complex part is that while trying to telepathically communicate with this star, when showing emotion the object were responding to my feeble attemps at communication.  I dont drink or use drugs.  I was sober.  I absolutely believe we all should be looking up.  Not just for a moment or two.  But spend and hour go sit under the stars.  Let your eyes adjust. You CAN communicate with it all if you let it happen.  This is also the first of any such article I have ever written on this or any similar subject.  I believed enough to find this page and offer my contribution.  I now believe.  I will be back out tonight and each night!

It had no noise, usually when planes are seen at that distance you can hear them.  Then a second light came out from the same NW place on the horizon (right of Division on the north side for Spokane people).  They were both following the same flight pattern and extremely close, heading diagonally to about a 45 degree angle then just disappearing.  They originated from the same spot and vanished from the same spot.  I continued to watch five more come out at the same spot and vanishing at the same spot during 5 minutes.   Then my fianc\u00e9 came out and saw two more do the same thing.  Then we saw two come, one right after the other, from the same spot on the horizon and then just hovered diagonally (about 2 inches apart, if I held my fingers up to measure).  Then one slowly disappeared followed shortly by the other. This happens once more an! d I am able to catch a little on video.

When suddenly to the south direction, I  noticed some very strange lights coming up over the trees heading west as we were going south.   This object was massive, I'd say it was a 1/2 mile away from our car, and from that distance, I would say that this thing was easily over 500 feet high and 3 to 400 feet wide.  It had two arms protruding out in front of it and it appeared to have a head and face in the middle.  It was making a very loud vibrating sound  and would occasionally rise up higher and was churning the ground up as it traveled and this object looked as if it had a large body or it was riding on a very large machine.   In the morning or when i woke up i had absolutely no memory of seeing this or did I even rememberthat i had filmed ir until 4 days ago when i was going through the video in my phone.  I didn't know what I was looking at when i watched t! he video until i played it a few times and some of that morning started to come back.  I want you to watch the video.

It was about a 7 foot wide beam of light and I was approximately 1000 feet relative to the event.  There's no way I could be the only person who saw this.   It didn't look like any light any person could have possibly owned.  This thing shot way up into the clouds and was intense.

The just out of the sky, we hear this enormously loud trumpet blast, three times! (He said it sounded more like a trombone because of its timbre.)   On my piano, I found the notes were within a four-key (such as C,E,E and F - a major key signature) and were slurred (no break in-between the four-note phrase).  Each blast lasted about a second.  So loud!  We both agreed we had never heard anything like this and have no idea what could've been its source except to say that it came from the sky!  We discussed all of the options we could think of and came up with nothing that we're aware of that could emit these blasts. We are both retired Federal employees.  I am a former Public Affairs Officer for the USFS. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Actually, we are located east of Reardon and west of Spokane (just west of the ATV park just west of the Spokane River) in a coulee.  I don't think I was very accurate in my description of where we were because I was still stirred up over that noise!  If you travel Highway 2 east of Reardon, Coulee Hite Road is a left hand turn off Highway 2.  We were sitting in our little pop up camper which we have set up on our ranch property right now; it's so nice to enjoy our coffee there because it's cool (in the morning and evening) with the breezes.  I will ask our neighbors if they have heard any noises. We heard another one last night, but just a single loud blast; however, it was different from the three blasts we heard the other evening.  In fact, my husband and I are still talking about it, racking our brains for trying to remember anything similar that we've heard but so far, no luck!  ((END ADDENDUM))",

At approximately 4:48 PM on January 24, 2007, Wednesday, a total of eight UFO's flew overhead from West to East in the clear sky of Spokane, Washington.  The first that went over was a large (about the size of my thumb nail) and extremely bright spherical light, then 7 elongated triangular flying objects flew over.  The triangles were as long as my thumb (held at arm's distance).  The edges were illuminated and showed depth. There were 6 amber colored lights under each one of the triangles.  There was no sound.  This occurred during the fireworks display for the opening ceremonies of the United States Figure Skating Championship.  The fireworks had just started, perhaps about a minute into the display when up above the arrow head shaped craft flew over following the sphere of extremely bright light.  The first triangle went over, then the second, then the third turned sharply to the left then the right, the fourth one went over, then the fifth, the sixth and when the seventh one went over itchanged shape.  The moment I said to the witness with me that these were not a flock of birds.they transformed to a flock of birds in front of our eyes.

At about 10:32 am at Riverfront Park a large oval shaped craft was spotted flying very slowly while I was relaxing under a shaded tree in a large grass field area of the Park.  It had a high glossy silver color, and reflected the sun rays exposing the highly reflective metal.  It was as large and oval like a blimp and just after about 13 seconds, it completely vanished, leaving a short chem-trail just before it disappeared.  The day this occured, the sky was completely void of clouds and the object did not decrease in size before vanishing like airplanes do, it was simply there one second, then gone the next.  I searched the sky for it after it left but couldn't find it.  Im convinced from this experience and others, that they are here, and they do exist..",

It made absolutely no sound.  I'm not sure just how large it was because I don't know how high it was flying but I could see it well enough to see detail on it. It was as big as a plane would be if it were flying quite low, as if it were going to land soon. I could tell it was metallic because it was reflecting the lights from the city. It was a perfect triangle with rounded corners. It had a circle on each corner as if they were lights, but as I said it was not lit up when I saw it. There was also a circle directly in the middle of the triangle. I froze when I saw it. I watched it fly from east to west until it was no longer in sight. It did not fly very fast, about the same as an airplane, but it was no airplane I've ever seen before. I guess it could have been a secret government craft, but I know it was not like the Stealth or anything like that. It was obvious that it didn't want to be seen. As soon as it was out of sight, I got up and wrote the exact time and date of what I saw in my diary, and I drew a picture of it. The next day I told my mother what I had seen, and she said she had seen the same object the night before, except when she saw it she said it had a green neon glow around it.

We weren\u2019t quite sure what to make of it and thought we would hear something about it somewhere but never did.

I live in Spokane Valley, WA and I had just gone out to the street to move my car in the driveway for the night when I noticed a light moving quickly across the southeastern sky, from right to left. The light was unusual, multicolored, and seemed to be flashing in a rotating motion. My immediate thought was a meteor (I've seen meteors before) when all of a sudden it made an abrupt change of direction from left to right. That's when I noticed the second object, which seemed to be wavering in one position, the light pattern was the same on this object. The first object came within close proximity of the second object and stopped, then the first object started to move at a rapid speed straight up, then stop and move down towards the horizon very rapidly, almost like a figure 4, again it raised up, at an angle, and stopped. The other object did not move. At this time I noticed a prop driven aircraft approaching from the north, I could hear the sound of the engine in the distance and recognized the red flashing safety lights (Felts Field Aviation is just 2 miles from where I live and this sighting took place so I see aircraft on a regular basis.) As the aircraft got closer to the objects the first object that had been moving across the sky suddenly dropped to the horizon and I lost sight of it, I have to say I lost track of the second object since all of my attention was affixed on the first one that was doing all the strange maneuvers. I quickly ran in the house to call my girlfriend and brother to come and look, my girlfriend came out and witnessed the last of the event. She saw the erratic movement up and down, across left to right, she saw the lights move and actually go out then back on, then witnessed the object drop all the way to the horizon. The aircraft seemed to pass directly through the objects location and continued on, by then both objects had vanished.",

We decided to drive all night because we have a disabled son that has a late schedule. Twenty miles out from Spokane on HWY 90 east around 4:30am we encountered several sparklers like things hovering over our car just off the right side of the windshield. I noticed that they were pacing our car as we drove. I felt like I was being hypnotized by the sparklers like objects. I noticed my wife and son staring at it and not saying a word about what was happening. I thought this was some kind of warning and felt very scared that something was going to happen to us. I was afraid to stop so I lowered my speed and shielded my eyes so I could not see them. By doing so I felt like I was not being affected by the attempt by them to hypnotized me. I was scared at this point and yelled out to my wife, \"Is it trying to hypnotiz! ed you, is it a warning of some kind.\" Cathy finally said something like \"I don't know what do they want?\" I kept looking down at the time and it didn't seem like it was changing even after a very long time and miles had past. I was thinking they wanted to hurt us or do something to the road ahead to hurt us. Each time I took my hand down from shielding my eyes I felt again they were trying to hypnotize me, like I was blacking out and not in control. I remember cars and trucks passing in the other direction and honking there horns at us as if they were seeing these things over our car. We begin praying and saying the lords prayer, it seem as if I could not think as if my mind went blank and I could not remember even what was happening to us and even what these things looked like. I had to put a memory into my head what they looked like or I think I wouldn't remember what they looked like. I remember saying to Cathy they look like giant sparklers at the same time she said it! . I thought they had gone away but they must have just moved a! way for a short time because I noticed they were back and I remember saying to Cathy no they are still here, don't look at them. She noticed my speed had dropped to 40 miles an hour in a 70 miles an hour zone and she told me to speed up or we were going to be hit from behind. Soon after that they left. I think that they tried to abduct us but were not able to because of the medication I take for depression. (Zoloft) I feel if I had not taken this medication that night we would of for sure been abducted by these strange devices that hovered over our car for such a long time that night.  500 Lights On Object0: Yes",

As I came out of the main terminal lobby about 12:40 am I was with another gentleman to have a smoke. We looked north and saw about a dozen moving objects that looked liked stars in size, but were a distance off toward the north over what we knew was a military base, but as we watched these objects simply did what no flying object we have could do. They would fly at great speeds; stop on a dime and at great speeds would make right angle turns that should smash any inhabitants like a bug from the inertia of such a turn.  The man I was with was some flight specialist and was able to determine speeds roughly and distance etc, because he was simply trained in such things - I thought maybe he was a pilot himself. But he told me quite frankly that the objects have to be traveling several thousand miles per hour in the \u201cbursts\u201d of speed. They would all suddenly fly into one place as to meet, then fly apart in different direction and stop on a dime - staying there for a short time. Some would fly then other directions and take those right turns without slowing or stopping. You just can\u2019t watch that kind of thing and think that we have any aircraft whatsoever that has that kind of ability. They did seem to glimmer from a bright whitish to other colors, but our distance from them it was hard to distinguish it and then - after near 10 - 12 minutes of watching this \u201cdance in the sky\u201d - they all flew off it different directions like a 4th of July exploding flare shot. And, no - it was no firework show either. Even if it were fireworks - even that is NOT allowed over the military base that we were watching this happen over. I had never known anyone to have ever reported this before now. The thing is - that the very next night on another grave yard shift at about closer to 2 am I saw the very same thing. This time about 5 people were standing outside watching it and I had told them I had seen it the night before as well - just didn\u2019t know what it was, but said - nothing can fly like those things that we have - so it\u2019s something else.  Having had a friend who used to work with NASA I had discussed with him my theory that these are not inter planetary, but rather inter-dimensional and the discussion turned into the color changing issue as they change and right when they disappear from site is at the ultra-violet or infra-red spectrum so the idea of inter-dimensional seemed to fit with that scenario and the idea of the speeds and right turns they could make without getting hurt would indicate this same idea - that, inter dimensionally they could pull this off. So, that\u2019s my story.",

I can see the lights of the lights Valley Mall about 7miles east of my apartment, which is about 190 feet above street level. Y W a friend of mine living on the 17th floor came up to my apt to listen to the Coast to Coast radio program, we usually listen to George Noory together most evenings from 10 to 11 PM. She brought with her a bag of micro-waved popcorm and she then sat next to the window looking east while I found a container to pour the hot bag of popcorn into. I then sat down beside her and after a few moments there appeared lights out side our window. Yvone ask, what are those. I answered they look like UFO\u2019s to me, and I opened the window wide so we could get a clearer view of a spectacle taking place in the sky. We saw 5 orbs each one looked exactly the same as all the others the were glowing the color of a soft pink similar to the color of the rising moon at night. The were all in a straight line of 5 round orbs or discs straight up into the sky. The were approximately 1, 500 feet away right over the Spokane Community College and were approximately 500 feet above the ground. Each one was moving in rotation around each other. This was a sight of beauty that reminded me later of looking down upon a group of square dancers. You know the doe, see, doe, and spin your partner type thing. The size of each of the 5 orbs or balls was the same, each was approximatly the size of a hot air baloon. There was no sound as they continued to circle around each other in the sky in front of our ring side seats. The speed of each rotation was a complete rotation took less than one second. After viewing this for about 5 seconds I decided to get a picture of this strange scene and rose up to find a camera. At the same time I ask Yvone to keep her eyes on the orbiting orbs. A few seconds later Yvone said they were no longer visible and described them all rising together at an angle to the right rather than straight up. She also said that the color faded out and the last she could see was the out line or a circle of each one without the each soft orange color.",

      "story": "My son and I were in our vehicle at the intersection of East Wellesley and North Crestline at about 6 PM on 10/31/08 in Spokane WA and we saw a strange object way up high in the early dusk sky due north and slightly west of us for about 5-6 minutes before it vanished behind some clouds.  Its behavior was strange because it did not move like a helicopter or plane and there were no lights of any color.  The object stood out like a blimp but it was not shaped or colored like one.  It was too high up for a kite and if it was a kite at that height it was too large in size.  The object was very dark black and it moved in a somewhat hovering manner almost like a large bird but at that height and distance from us it was too large in size for a bird.  The object shape was somewhat like a boomerang, normally after seeing such an object I would be writing it off as something natural but then after 10 minutes there was no sign of the object in any direction from where we first observed it. I thought that maybe if anyone else made a report to you that my information might help, I am sorry but I had no observing or recording equipment with me at the time.",

We could not stop talking about it that night and decided that we would go up into the foothills by our home the next day to search for it.  It seemed so low, like only a thousand feet above us.  I recently read a book called \"Search for the Skinwalker\" which made reference to a military base in Montana that had logged a glowing round UFO crossing their skies that same night back in 1975.  So I thought I would file a report here and see if any other Spokane-area people witnessed it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1975 may be approximate.  PD))",

I waited to hear the roar but as it approached overhead I still could not hear anything.  As it flew overhead it took a very quick and bizzare little jog.

I don;t know nor can I even guess if it was something form earth or not.  Why would an alien craft have strobe lights like that?  Did anyone else see it?

The light looked white, and was not moving. I watched it for about 5 minutes to make sure it was not moving. Then i went inside my house to get my girlfriend to come take a look at it also. It was very cold so we went back inside and I checked on it again about 15 minutes after I first seen it. It was still there but it was getting pretty cloudy and the light was getting dimmer, I am not sure if it was the clouds making it dimmer. But when i went to look if it was still there about 30 minutes after i first seen it, it was not there. But it was really cloudy by then, so i think maybe the clouds was hiding it. The reason i find this light to be so interesting is because this is not the first light I seen like this. Sorry my computer does not have Microsoft word any more. Around this time of year, last year I seen a light just like this one, only this one was close and i knew exactly where it was. I lived by a Mountain i use to run up all the time, it has those towers with red lights that blink at night. One night around 3 a.m. at night i went outside to have a smoke, and right above those towers there was a huge bight white light. I say its huge because it looked way closer then this last one I seen, but i did not think \"UFO\" at that time. But I knew that there is no reason a light like that should be there at that time of night. It took me about 10 minutes to finish my smoke, but i watched a little longer to see if it would move. By then I knew this was not normal and wanted to go grab my cell phone to get it on camera, so i could show my girlfriend and others. So I went inside my house to get it all the way down stairs, and went back out and it was still there. I was able to get it on video, I could of went on forever but i can only send 15 seconds of a clip to my girlfriend that lived in Minnesota at the time. I sent it to her, but the light was very smal! l on my cell phone cam and did not look like anything i was looking at. Now since I watch UFO Hunters I know these type of lights are while known, and would like to know what it is i am seeing. I wish I knew what I know now or i could of simply called 911 and drove over to that light and got really close to it. The one that i just now seen looked pretty far away and I did not want to drive in the ice we got out here. This one I don't really know what it could have been since it looked so far away, I am thinking maybe a planet may have been really close, but I don't know. The other light I seen was a \"UFO\" for sure. But I will keep watching maybe I will be lucky and see a light like my first one.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD))",

This jet was very high - it was a clear, sunny day, (today, April 8th, 2011) and the object appeared to be angled to the right side, higher than the jet but cruising along at the same speed, same path of flight. We watched until the jet left our view.   This happened over a period of about 3 minutes.  The jet was flying over Spokane. Again, this was a large jet at cruising altitude. It was travelling east.  The witnesses include two adults, one teenager, 3 children.   We each speculated what it could be and it was not, and could not, have been part of the plane as it was not attached.  Given the height of the jet, the object had to be relatively close to have been noticed but it! was definitely discernable as a separate object.  There was no jet stream from the object like there was from the plane, and it had no propellant system that was visible.  We definitely had a clear view of the plane and object.

On the warm evening in June of 1999, It was just getting dark, I lived above the Salteese flats, a drained lake bed, that is swampy till late summer.  My car window was down, I noticed on the far side of the lake bed, aprox: 1/4 to 1/2 mile away.  There was a set of very bright lights with smaller green lights behind moving back and forth on what I first thought was the road across the lake bed. I stopped to observe the erratic behavior.  After 20 seconds or so, I realized the object was below the road, and switching directions too quickly for it to be a car.  I wondered maybe a helicopter?, but there was no sound and I know that sound carries well across that marshy land.  I then realized that the object had turned 90 degrees and was then headed straight at my car, still no sound.  I know there is no path in that area for any vehicle to traverse without getting bogged down.  I also realized it was flying too high to be a car on the ground.  I put my car in gear and! decided to move down the road out of the way.  The object arrived on the road on my side of the road and again did a sharp 90 degree turn in my direction, I then became very alarmed so I accelerated my car to the point of unsafe speed.  Keeping my eyes on road and rear view mirror I saw the object was now following me at speeds 55 mph on winding  roads.  All I could see in the rear mirror was now two lights brighter than any halogen lights I've ever seen, blinding me in the mirror.  I was now terrified and kept thinking please god let me get home so I can tell my husband.  I hit the crest of the steep hill still doing 50 mph. At that point I was 90 seconds from my drive way.  But I do not remember pulling into the drive or entering the house, let alone telling my husband what had just occurred.  The next I recalled was getting up the next morning. I had been terrified but did not even recollect the event till over a week later.  No matter what has ever happened, I have always talked to my spouse.  All I wanted was to survive to tell my spouse, yet I did not remember.  Nor am I given to hysteria.  My mind is completely blank as to the end of that event, yet I recall every last detail leading up to it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It traveled at aprox. 120-200 knots, about what I would expect of a aircraft.  We are close to Felts Field but the tower was closed at this time and it was not in the pattern or even close and it was not on approach to Spokane Int or Fairchild AFB.   I had my cell phone camera and decided to take about 20 pictures. I forgot about them then the other day I looked at them and noticed a object above the bright light.  It seems to take several different forms and changes form.  I realized my phone was a video also and took a video and in the video, on frame by frame play only you can see the object! go behind the bright light then back which you could not see at normal speed.  Also you can hear the sound of what sounds like a jet aircraft but during this all I heard nothing.  I did have my truck running during most of the time which would have covered any sounds but when I turned it off I don't recall any sounds.  I have a extensive aviation background, could fly before I could drive, lived on a airport, father is a retired 747 pilot, I know aircraft and this was not any type known to myself.  I don't have any idea what it is and I find it very interesting, whatever it is?",

It was triangular in shape, and almost looked like you could see through the middle of it, like it was transparent, yet I could still see very defined edges of the shape.  There were no lights coming from it, and no sound, yet on the edges of the craft it looked as though there were shapes on it on the outer edge that were square and rectangular shapes that I could make out that didn't look to be in any particular pattern.

On the night of November 18th, 2010 at approximately 8:20 P.M, 2 good friends and myself  saw something  about  100 feet away (behind an unoccupied house)and 150-200 feet above the ground hovering.  I was driving home from the store about 1 block south of my home in Millwood.  I did not notice the object first of us three, my eyes were on the road.  I noticed my friend in the passenger seat was looking at something very intently.  He was gazing through the driver side window and practically leaned over me to stare at it, when my friend in the rear driver side seat blurted out \u201cdude what ((deleted)) is that in the sky?\u201d  My first reaction was to instinctively look at the object, but at first only glimpsed it for a brief moment before returning my eyes to the road. At first glance I certainly thought that someone in the area had inflated an advertisement blimp with lighting and let it float over their house attached to the ground via cable. After taking my eyes off of the object my observations had become clear to me, I had indeed seen something floating above the ground, unnaturally. I drove on about 50 feet and made a left hand turn onto my road and stopped after about another 20 feet to better observe the object as it was stationary when first sighted, and still on the left above the ground.  As soon as I stopped to observe it however, the object slowly turned 180 degrees and began moving in the direction that I had just came from slowly. I realized that the object had begun to move and shifted my car in reverse to pursuit. I reversed very quickly around the corner and started to chase the object with my car. As soon as I rounded the corner, however, the object was gone from sight passing behind trees in the neighborhood, and I sped ! down the street to see it again and reached 60 mph before I got the last glimpse of it (I was the only one to see it that last time) speeding across the road in a southwestern direction. I returned home and reviewed my observations with my friends. What I saw was almost blimp shaped- metallic grayish in color- with what appeared to be 3 street lights (or lights with similar color) on its underside.  Rounded like a blimp on the top of it and concaved on the underside.  There was no sound observed by us.  Although we had the music volume turned up, it was reasoned by us 3 that if it were a helicopter or anything man-made than we should have heard it, especially in considering that the object was very close to us.  When the object began to move I noticed that the lights on the bottom side got significantly bright for a brief moment than begun rotating around the object, and at my last glimpse of it I only saw a circular ring of light speeding across the road.

One object was perfectly still in the southern part of the sky while the other object moved slowly and silently from east to west then stopped and went straight up into the sky until it disappeared.  The object to the south remained stationary. Approximately 30 seconds later, another bright orange ball appeared out of the East at what appeared to be a very low altitude and appeared to be heading right towards us. There was absolutely no sound associated with it. People were pulled over in their car and a man came running over to me asking if I was seeing what he was seeing.

      "story": "Dozens of lights in the sky over Spokane Wa. Seen of 4 different occasions On the 31st of July 2011, my boyfriend and I were outside around 10:30 at night. I saw what, at first, I thought was a shooting star. I pointed it out to him and we both watched it move across the sky and get dimmer and brighter.  It seemed to be at a pretty high altitude, but hard to say with no size reference to compare it to.  We continued to watch it for about 30-45 seconds until it completely faded away.  Thought it was kinda odd.  But then another one popped up in the sky, in a completely different spot. It didn't move in a straight pattern this time. It moved up and down left and right at a pretty steady pace. Not fast, not slow. Almost like a cruising like matter you'd see an airplane travel at. Mind you there were NO flashing lights. Just ONE solid light that was white, like a star. Hence why I thought at first it was a shooting star. We watched it until it faded away as well. THEN AGAIN, a third one pops up in a completely different spot and does the s! ame thing. Gets really bright and moves around until it fades away to nothing. We definitely thought it was strange but didn't have any explanation. The next night August 1st 2011, around 10:30 again, I was outside and out of the corner of my eye I caught a light flash in the sky. It was exactly like what we had seen the night before. I watched it travel across the sky until it faded completely. I stayed outside to watch a little longer but didn't see any other lights. THE NEXT NIGHT August 2nd 2011, again around 10:30, I was again, outside when THIS TIME I was looking to the sky to see if I'd catch a glimpse of the lights. And to my \"not so much surprise\" I seen another light!! By this point my mind is blown and I'm really wishing my boyfriend was out there to witness the lights with me again. I had told a couple people about it and every night I would watch the sky to see if there were any more lights. But there was nothing. Last night (mind you this was at 10:00pm last night August 17th 2011) my best friend and neighbor calls me and asks if I can hear the helicopter outside flying around. Apparently they were looking for someone because they had their spot light on looking in all the back yards. (This is the NW Blvd/Maple-Ash neighborhood) When I came out I looked up and seen what I thought was the helicopter. I say to my friend that I don't see its spotlight. She then directs me to the south where the helicopter was when all along I was looking at the bright light \"flying\" around in the northern sky. I am then VERY excited and tell her to come look at the bright light, explaining to her that its just like what I had seen earlier in the month. We watched it fly around until it faded away completely. We sat outside and started talking about how strange the light was when ANOTHER one pops up out of nowhere in the northeastern sky.  Our older kids (10 and 12yrs) come outside wondering why we've bee! n gone so long.  So we start explaining to them whats up. When YET AGAIN another light pops up in the sky. My best friend goes inside to get her camera so we can try and capture some of this. Me and the boys see yet another one moving from west to east, the light got REALLY bright, stopped, then descended to what looks like, from our position, to be about the felts field/valley area. Hard to say from our viewpoint exactly. Anyways, while it descended, it started pulsating red and orange. We watched it until it slowly drop out of the sky until it was out of our view. By this point we're really tripping out! (We never heard any booms though, always silent) We sat out there and continued to watch the \"lights in the sky\" until about 11:00. There were too many to count. Had to be DOZENS of different lights. Some individual and some in groups. Some travel in the exact same flight pattern as the one before it, some are completely random. Some blink on and off. Some are just really ! dim like the light you'd see when a satellite moves across the! sky, an d some are extremely bright!  To me they're UFO's... now that does NOT mean its aliens but it sure as hell DOES mean they're unidentified!!! The best way I can describe them is, they look like stars at first, then they get REALLY BRIGHT, and travel across the sky in no particular pattern and fade away until you can't see them with your naked eye anymore. They do NOT fly in straight lines every time either. Some do, but others move from left to right then up and down then back to the left again. Very strange. Going out tonight to try and catch this on video.! Really hoping for clear skies tonight!!  There were many reports and A LOT of talk on our local news stations facebook pages last night, 8/17/2011 and today, 8/18/2011, about a bright light seen over the Spokane Valley that fell from the sky and a HUGE BOOM that shook people out of their homes to the streets to investigate. The light that we seen descending from the sky, pulsating orange and red is approximately the same time as the reports from the Valley. Coincidence? There is currently no explanation to what these witnesses in the valley experienced.",

We noticed a small star that would move rapidly in a straight line one direction not very far at all then stop abruptly and change its trajectory.  This went on for a few minutes and we decided to bail, quickly, and drove back to her parent\u2019s house. I cannot recall the conversation we had on the drive, I do recall driving fast down that dirt road though.

The sound increased as it appeared to fly over, but again, nothing appeared against the night sky\u2026although commercial airlines were easily spotted along with their exhaust and/or contrails. As It seemed to pass to the West, I stepped out of the hot tub onto an adjoining deck and noticed two red light, similar to the port wing light of an aircraft although these did not flash.  Now, what was amazing was the distance between these lights.  I called my wife to jump up and look, which she did and also saw the lights which by now were several miles away.  The distance between these lights at best estimate was 2000\u2019\u2014and no siloutte of an aircraft.  We watch the lights disappear through the horizon, but the noise, still a very low rumble continued for another 4 \u2013 5 minutes. Our home is situated within the apporach patterns of FAFB and have seen and heard aircraft from tankers to stealth fighter but have NEVER heard an engine noise of that low frequency or decibal level. That\u2019s it.",

The craft was flying ahead parallel to the car and once I saw the craft, it appeared to fall back and fly side by side, looked to be a one man triangle craft with dull blinking lights and was completely silent. No one else in the car saw it and appeared to be watching us for the duration of the drive on Dishman Mica Road (about 5 min). I looked away to tell my parents and looked back and saw the craft fly away slowly. It didn't look to be in a hurry, though I was able to make out a shape in the cockpit. I have never seen a craft fly so low and be so quiet. That is why my parents probably didn't notice it.  All this happened in the mid 80's while I was a kid, the whole family was in the car. The date above is very approximate. I'm sure it was Fall because of how early darkness was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

After I saw the eye color I went back in the house waiting for it to try to get in or peek in my windows so I laid on my couch looking and waiting and listening for and nothing happened  so I just tried to go to sleep and just get over it buy this time I was in denial and thought ok it was a deer. The next morning I thought about what I saw and walked out to the field where I saw it there was nothing but I remembered what it looked like and it was up right a light shade of blue witch could have been from the moon light it was really skinny and tall  with a tear drop shaped head that kind of  just formed in to the body no shoulders and long arms that looked like tentacles. But that\u2019s all I remember and know I can say it was flat out the most scariest moment I have ever been through I have seen ghosts and ufo\u2019s but nothing like that and it still scares me just thinking about it and its been almost a month another thing! just a week or two before my event there was reports of stra! nge ligh ts over one of my city\u2019s neighbor hoods that was on the news the next day or day after but I didn\u2019t think twice about this because I was in denial about what I saw until  like two weeks after it all happened than I started realizing that it could be possible that I actually saw an alien putting the two events together",

      "story": "I saw four lights in perfect formation at about 60 thousand feet. At approximately 7:40 am I was sitting in my hot tub facing south-west.  At first I saw one white light traveling way slower than an airplane and even slower than a satellite.  I thought maybe someone had let a balloon loose but it was so high I thought it was doubtful.  I am pretty sure the altitude was twice as high as an airplane flies, so maybe 60,000 feet?  I am a private pilot so I have a little bit of experience with judging altitude, but it is hard to say because of not really knowing what I was looking at. After about 10 seconds I noticed a second and then third light that formed a perfect triangle.  The front light was white and the side lights were red, not solid red, but reddish.  After a few more seconds I saw the fourth and final light.  It was white and trailed the front white light by 3 to 4 times the distance from the front light to either of the red lights.  So what I saw was a perfect triangle of white in front and red on both side and then the trailing light. Why I am intrigued with what I saw is because of the perfect geometry of the shape.  The lights were traveling from south west to north east.  As it turns out I had a perfect view from my hot tub.  The lights travelled directly above my head.  I think it took between 10 and 12 minutes from about 30 degrees from horizon to about 120 degrees of horizon.  I am not sure if that is how you describe it but I am thinking 180 degrees spectrum. I am not sure what I saw, but I have never seen anything like it in the past.",

      "story": "Dozens of free Flying Stars over Spokane on sunny afternoon, taking triangular formations.  White and Red Pulsing. I was waiting outside my girlfriends house off of sprague when I looked in the sky and saw dozens of flying objects that looked like stars in the blue clear skys around the afternoon sun.   After ten minutes or so they began to move around slowly at first, and I noticed that some of them were red and blinking while the others looked white and sparkly.   They would take triangular formations and the red stars would take a position in the middle of the triangles.   They would move back and forth, and fly toward the horizon, and accelerate at extremely high speed until disappearing.  Then they would be replaced by others that would return, while often the red pulsing ones would stay still or move slowly.  My girlfriend came outside and I pointed out the stars asking &quot;why are there stars over spokane in the middle of the day?&quot;  She got binoculars, and when we observed them the white sparkly stars were only what looked three red, blue, and green lights, ! together looking white with the naked eye.  They almost looked like the pixel of an old T.V. closeup.  The red ones were just red, and clear blue sky in between pulses as if nothing was there.  Eventually, they all either shot over the horizon with seemingly parabolic acceleration, or strangly flew into the sun until unobservable.  It almost seemed like it new I saw them, since they were not hardly visible or moving at all at first, and as soon as I had binoculars they all slowly dispersed.  Whatever they were, they were definitely coordinating they're movements and seemed to like the triangle formation, although it was not a constant theme as they silently moved where ever they liked.  Also, the red blinking ones seemed to be more stationary as the white ones formed triangles around them.  I reported to the police and the airport, both said call the airforce or one of the others.",

I was out there for less than a minute when I thought I saw a shooting star in my peripheral vision almost directly above me.  Upon focusing on it I saw two white circles, not like bright directional shining lights normally seen on a plane but just white circles.  I initially thought it could be one object total but it could be two separate in the same path of travel as the white circles were separated.  The white circles were about the same size around as a #2 pencil held out at arms length and they were spaced out to fit about two of those #2 pencil diameters in between them.  It was moving very fast from East to West.  I saw it from about 90 degrees to about 25 degrees above the horizon.  I could tell it was pretty high up because the sky was clear straight up and all the way to the east but to the west there was some very thin cloud cover that I was able to sti! ll see bright stars through and I could see the white circles slightly dim as it went behind one narrow cloud then get brighter after it passed over it into the clear for a bit and then went behind more cloud cover and got smaller the further away it was and dimmed and then it was gone. This all happened very fast. I estimate the total time from it first catching my eye till it went out of sight was 4 seconds. I know for a fact it was not a plane or a satellite. Way too incredibly fast to be either. The object made no noise. It was purely silent. I also pulled up airplane radar flight records online between 12:10 and 12:20 and there was no planes flying over the city in this timeframe. I talked to an individual at a local airport about it and they stated that it could be a secret military aircraft as they fly those in the middle of the night so they aren't easily seen. Whether this is true or not I have no idea. It suppose it could be as it was headed in the direction of a ! nearby air force base.

      "story": "Multiple orange orbs over downtown Spokane. While driving south through downtown Spokane- passing Spokane Club on the right.  I looked out of the drivers window while stopped at traffic light.  I noticed a steady orange light between the tree branches to my left.  The light was some distance above the trees, at about a 60 degree angle relative to my car.   I pointed out the object to my wife and opened the moon roof of the car so she could see.  My son in the back seat just behind me also saw the object.   At that time I noticed two other bright orange objects but lower and seemed to be following the first object spotted yet the tree were in a line from west to east.  The traffic light had changed so I needed to move and briefly thought they might have been military aircraft.  These lights did not make a sound I could hear, were not common aircraft light colors, and did not strobe so I dismissed that idea.  The lights were moving east-to-west against the prevailing winds which would exclude luminaria.  I thought the lights were very odd.   We proceeded south to the freeway onramp since we were headed home to the east in Spokane Valley.  I told my wife and son the keep an eye out for the objects we had just seen since I had to drive.  The highway is elevated above the city so we had a better view above the buildings.  I glanced several times over my shoulder to the left toward the objects.  I was able to get a good estimate of the altitude.  There were three objects I could clearly make out, but possibly four or five, since I was driving I was only able to focus on the first three objects.  Object furthest to the west (which I believe was the first object) was at about 1250 feet, the second two were at about 450 feet (above ground level).  They were about evenly spaced about 500 feet apart horizontally.  From I-90 the first object was roughly over Masonic Temple with the last object being over River Park Square.  I could clearly triangulate from the first sighting, the freeway sightings, and using size of the buildings in downtown Spokane for a reference.   After getting home I dropped off my wife, son and car at the house, this was about 2110.  I got in my truck and headed back downtown to investigate the objects, while driving to roof of parking garage at Sacred Heart Medical Center there was a brief flash of light in the pickup,  I think this was a mercury vapor streetlamp flashing or a surge to the truck cab lamp so not concerned.  Only stopped briefly to observe on the top level of west parking garage at SHMC.  No objects visible over Spokane at this time.   Returned home at 2130.",

Last night upon entering our ((deleted--work area)) on my 1st round at 8:45 pm; immediately I could see a number of highly luminous glowing orange spherical objects (orb like) through the trees as I looked west over the roof of our ((deleted)) toward the Convention Center of the Downtown area.   Having witnessed 3 of these objects 4 months ago and since having heard the sweeping reports from all over the country, I knew this was going to be a big event that I wanted as many people as possible to see.   So I immediately ran into our ((deleted--area))  and summoned as many interested witnesses as I could by asking everyone if they wanted to witness some UFO\u2019s.  First thing; I had our ((deleted)) attendant accompany me as he along with many of his neighbors had personally witnessed over thirty of these same objects traveling through a couple weeks before I had over 4 months ago.  When we and the some 10 to 12 guests arrived on the scene, we were all amazed and perplexed at the show the near dozen of these firey orange objects were putting on as they floated around drifting upward and slowly gliding around from north to south with their distinctive luminous orange glow.   Because I was trying to acquire as many witnesses as possible, I was unable to closely examine the movements and activity of the objects for very long.  However, from what I did witness, they appeared and acted exactly the same as those I had witnessed some months back. After about 7 minutes had passed, and I was scrambling to get more witnesses to observe the phenomena and get it recorded, suddenly all but a few ((deleted)) came back in side and said they all just vanished.   I then worked my way back out and there remained one mother and her daughter who showed me the one orange ufo remaining.  They told me that after all the ufos vanished and everyone left, this one object suddenly lit up and remained as it was hovering with its\u2019 distinct orange glow.   We watched on for a few minutes as this object stayed hovering only to lose its luminosity and vanish in thin air like the others\u2026   The mother then showed me the multiple pictures she took with her smart phone and I gave her my email address and she got my name and insisted that her and her daughter would email me the pictures as well as a detailed account of what they witnessed. As I write this report, I am still waiting and hoping she delivers on her words. This was an extraordinary event witnessed by over 10 people who were all mesmerized by the show these objects put on.  In fact a couple ((deleted)) came to me afterwards and thanked me very much for alerting them so they could witness the extraordinary phenomena.   In hindsight, however it was very disconcerting to me that 2 of the teenagers who caught the whole incident on video went right back into the ((deleted)) showed just a few people and then went right back to watching a football game like nothing even happened.  When I asked them if they could put the footage on youtube they just kind of blew me off like they didn\u2019t care.  I wish I had given them some money in exchange for the footage as it was the type of ufo event that many people hope to see their lifetime\u2026",

The object was moon-like in appearance minus the shadows, and was clearly in front of the thin layer of clouds and sunrays which were behind and above the object.   It was very bright, glowing, light gold with a very smooth surface -luminescent rather than metallic.  It appeared to be solid \u2013 light was not reflecting through it.  Size is difficult to guess, altho it seemed to be quite large and about a 45 degree angle above the horizon.   No clue as to distance or height, however, it was close enough to see details.   Outline of object was distinct with sky behind darker than object itself.  It remained stationary, but appeared to turn and change to a slightly faceted shape with what appeared to be two small triangular fins one above the other, protruding from behind.  The fins appeared to be of the same material and color.   As I continued driving SW toward the object, I saw a very small, very black spot which at first appeared and disappeared so I wasn\u2019t sure if I actually was seeing it.   The black spot appeared to expand until it was very clearly a rectangular shape located on the lower right quadrant (from my viewpoint).  It remained visible, but rectangular shape appeared to change to an hour glass shape.   The object remained stationary, but the descending sun made it more and more difficult to view.   At this point, the terrain obscured my view as I drove behind and up up a small hill.  At the top of the hill (about a minute later), I had full view of the SW sky and the object was gone.",

      "story": "Shiny spherical object traveling across sky SE-NW direction, hovers for 10 mins in NW, then leaves in N-S direction I was in my kitchen making lunch and I noticed my neighbors (about 5 of them, one who is retired military) were all outside talking, pointing and looking at the sky, and one of them had binoculars.  So I went out to see what was up. It was noon and the sky was absolutely clear of clouds. I observed was a spherical object moving across the sky, coming from the SE, headed in a NW direction. It was moving at a steady speed, slower than a satellite, maybe as fast as an airplane that was REALLY high (so I am guessing around 500-800 miles per hour).  The object appeared to be higher than most aircraft fly around here, but still definitely within the atmosphere.  It was extremely shiny.  It glinted a lot as it reflected the bright noon-time sunshine.  The light it reflected was white, which gave me the impression that the object was silvery and metallic.  It was hard to make out any details other than light, but because it was so evenly reflective, it seemed like it must have had a smooth surface. The object moved at a constant speed across much of the sky, about 75 degrees above the NE horizon once directly overhead, all the way from the SE horizon until almost to the NW horizon, in about 5 minutes time, until it stopped and just sat in one spot about 25 degrees above the horizon for about 10 minutes.  It still seemed round and very shiny.  I thought it was a single light, but my husband and my daughter thought they could sometimes see two \"lights,\" very, very close together.  It glinted a lot, like the object or the surface was moving ever so slightly, even while seemingly standing still.  There was never a time when there was not light reflecting from the object; it just changed in intensity, like a silver beaded windchime blowing in the breeze (but without any visible change in direction). After a bit, the object started to move again, toward the South, at the same speed as before. It soon went behind my neighbor's trees, from my vantage point, and the object was so far away and it was so bright outside that I couldn't find it again.  After a bit, the neighbors lost it too and went back inside.  During the sighting, there were no other aircraft in the sky (which is not very common around here, since the Spokane Airport and Fairchild Air Force Base are only about 10 miles away). However, about 10 minutes after the UFO disappeared, I noticed two airplanes in the sky (with an obvious airplane shape to each of them, as opposed to the UFO), and both left distinct contrails. The UFO had left no trails at all, even though it was traveling at jet speeds.  The UFO did not give off any sound that was audible to me, but neither did those two airplanes, so it doesn't mean the craft didn't make noise way up high. If I were to guess, I would say this object was larger than a Boeing 747, but not more than twice as large.  After the sighting, it seemed like there was more airplane traffic than usual, but it may just been because we were looking to the sky more than usual. Again, we live close to an airport and a base, so airplanes are common in our skies.  The thing that makes this sighting stand out to me is the fact that the object had been moving in a NW direction, stopped and hovered in one spot for several minutes, and then started moving in a S direction. No airplane I have ever seen can hover like that, nor does it look round. Drones have wings or arms for rotors, so they should look more irregular than a sphere, and they shouldn't be as large as this was. No helicopter I have ever seen appears to be silver and round and that large when that high in the air (one would have been a speck). The ISS and satellites do not stop and then change direction.  I have never before seen a UFO and I was so shocked by this sighting that I watched, dumbfounded. I was worried I wouldn't be able to locate it again if I went for my camera, plus I wasn't sure if my camera would capture more than a glinty speck because the object was so far away. After the fact, I regret that I didn't dash quickly for my cell phone and get a video of this so as to share it with friends and family.",

I looked up in the sky at about 45 degrees towards the southeast and saw 12 orangish flickering lights moving through the sky towards the south.  At first I thought it looked like Santa\u2019s sleigh and reindeers light up.  As the lights curved and moved upwards  towards the south I noticed that they disappeared one by one as they were directly over our garage which is south of the house. \tI went inside and yelled for everyone to hurry up and get outside and look at the sky.  My husband, Sam Powell, and my neighbor who was over visiting, Zebbie Wassom, came outside.  I counted 10 lights in the sky.  We all watched for a few minutes.  There was no noise.  I saw new lights emerge from the distant southeast at about 30 degrees in the sky.  They appeared more of a flaming red color.  The lights followed an arcing pattern through the sky. (Appearing in the southeast, moving northwest, moving west, moving southwest, then moving south and disappearing.  All this activity occurred in the southern part of the sky.) Some lights were further apart from each other.  Some lights were higher than others but not by more than about 5 degrees.  Some lights appeared to change speed slightly.  Some lights appeared to change direction slightly.  As the lights got closer they all appeared more of an orange color. \tWe all went back inside.  My husband got out the phone book.  Zebbie and I grabbed our cell phones and went back outside. It was 7:20 pm according to my cell phone as Zebbie called her husband who was at home across the street and told him to look out the window towards the south in the sky. \tZebbie went back inside shortly thereafter.  I continued watching until the last light was gone at 7:24 pm. Overall, I counted about 15 lights in the sky at one time and about 24 lights total.   The lights were high up in the sky \u2013 not to be confused with airplanes coming in for approach to Spokane International Airport or Fairchild Air Force Base.  The lights appeared larger when they emerged from the distant southeast sky. When they were closer they were about the size of a regular star in the sky except they were bright and flickered.  The lights did not come down from the sky instead the moved across: in, around, and then out. The lights did not have a tail on them like a comet. I didn\u2019t bother to try and record this event on my cell phone because I thought the clarity would be bad and besides it would be on the news with an explanation of what had happened. The rest of the evening and for a few days I watched  local TV news stations to see if anyone else saw it, but nothing was reported that day or since.

On 2/5/14 I was awoken to a loud sound that sounded like after burners of a rocket.  The noise was coming from right above our house and it shook our room.  My father was an airplane pilot and we have airplane's and helicopter's that go over our house frequently.  So, I am very familiar with the noises that they make when they travel over the air space above our home.   I knew right away that this was no airplane because I grew up around airplanes as my dad was a pilot.  The noise startled me because I never, ever had heard anything like that before in our area.   I got up looked out our large bay window from the 2nd floor of our house and couldn't believe what I saw.  I saw an object that was changing colors that was hovering and like floating westbound through the air.   My husband and son also got up and witnessed the object, and they couldn't believe what we were seeing.  The object changed colors from a beautiful emerald green, red, blue, orange and also to a white color.   We were so surprised to see such an object right in front of our own eyes that was so beautiful just traveling slowly through the air westbound towards Seattle.   We watched it and watched it, of all times none of our cameras were working.  While watching it at one point we did witness what appeared to be a helicopter approach the object.  They kept their distance from the object, they didn't get close to it.  The helicopter stayed back from it, again didn't get close to it at all and it finally it backed off and left the object alone.  The object appeared to be larger than the helicopter but not by much.   The object just seemed to hover in the sky slowly moving westbound.  We watched the object until we could no longer see it any longer.  We were shocked to see such an unbelievable site, and we have always been uncertain about if there are UFO's in the world or not.   After seeing th! is AMAZING BEAUTIFUL OBJECT, the three of us that watched it for the a pp. 44 minutes are believers!!  We would of never ever had the opportunity to witness such an unbelievable, AWESOME, site it the noise it had made when it was traveling through the sky hadn't awoken me again at about 2:00 AM, when we normally are sleeping.   We felt excited, had so many questions that we will never have answered and we did feel somewhat scared, as the questions go on and on. In the end we felt very blessed to see such a site, and again we now are believers in UFO's as our family had just seen one.   It shook our room and the noise was unbelievable.  Without the noise that it made in passing through the sky in the middle of the night, we would never ever witnessed such an astonishing site of a object that appeared to be a real UFO!!

At about 6:57 PDT, I saw two blinking lights zooming around.  It started with one very small and bright, blue-white light heading east, which appeared to be a satellite. I was about fifteen miles north of Spokane, WA and looking to the south.  A second one appeared slightly to the east of the first and heading west, toward the other one.  They were blinking randomly about one second each two to four seconds.  At this time I thought I was watching something taking place a thousand feet above I-90, in Spokane Valley.  They might have been a few miles north of Mica Peak. As the two small, intense, blinking lights interacted for thirty seconds or so, they changed speed and direction.  Because the lights were off more than they were on, it was hard to tell which one was which as they cirlcled.  Sometimes they may have been moving at about the speed of airplanes and sometimes much faster than any airplane.  I blinked my eyes and asked myself if I was really seeing it in the physical realm and the answer was yes.   After twenty or thirty seconds, they separated and disappeared when they were about a mile apart, providing they were actually above I-90.  --  I can't rule out some sort of Laser light show, but it sure looked like an interdimensional light show to me.       -- Sincerely, J S",

I was waiting for the 11:55 am bus headed north to my home in Deer Park.  I estimate the time to be about 11:30 am.   I was facing north and I happen to look up at the sky to see a very large, white object heading east to west at height and with speed.  What surprised me was the speed it seemed to travel and the size it was.  Normally, when one sees a plane at that height the plane is small, hard to see, and moving at a speed that appears slow to our relative perspective.   This white colored object, however, was 3 to 4 time larger that a plane would be at that height and is travel through a large cloud break at a very fast pace.  Much faster than any convention planes I\u2019ve ever seen.   Oddly enough it also left no condensation trail of any kind.   I would normally discount this as the sun reflecting off an airplane but I can still not account for the size of this thing, the lack of any type of condensation trail, and the speed it was moving at.",

I looked up at what I thought may be very bright plane or maybe satellite but the movement was like NOTHING I have ever seen before.  This light was almost falling slowly in the north eastern part of the sky.  Almost a 60-70\u2022 angle above horizon.   It would \"fall\" or orbit downward in a feather like trajectory, swaying from left to right slowly and then stopping perfectly still with no blinking lights or sound of any kind.  Then it would start up again never really following a pattern but seemingly heading downward toward the horizon.  Then it just disappeared.   I have been a lifelong satellite watcher and can say it was a bit bigger or at least brighter but not much.  It had absolutely no flashing lights and when planes or helicopters are that close there is sound.   Not sure what to think.  Does ISS behave this way?",

Then a black shiny polished looking orb flies over in a perfect trajectory flying S.E. (like the ISS, I see it fly over at night alot)  The elevation could be around 2 - 4 hundred feet.   It could not have been affected by the wind as it seemed to be in an orbit like the ISS.  Did not make a sound and I continued watching until it went out of sight in the far S.E. and I know it wasn't ISS because this was under the clouds, black and much larger.   It did not appear to change in elevation during the 30 seconds it was viewable.  Again it was black and had a shiny polished look to it.   The size was not large from my perspective about the size of a half dollar at arm's length at its closest from my back yard it was just a bit east of my position in west Spokane but almost straight over so I got a good look at it.

The craft slowly descended down to the sidewalk, the craft was around 4 ft. long and 2 ft. tall. and had green and blue lights all over, the craft also made a few sounds along the lines of \"boop beep ziiip\". The craft hovered in front of me and my parents for a short time before shooting off into the sky. Us 3 are the only witnesses to this event as far as I know. I'm not sure if our dog should count as a witness or not, he did bark at the object a few times, so if you do count as animals as witnesses, it's 4. ((NUFORC Note:  Serious report, or maybe not??  PD)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #1 FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Dear Peter, Thank you for replying to my report. My report is 100% sincere. My parents don't believe in aliens and are dismissing this and don't want to get involved, so I'm all you've got right now.  I live east coast near D.C.  I own a Cessna 172g and fly it for recreational purposes, I am currently looking into a job to be a Pilot. I did not fly a plane to Spokane where my parents live, I took a long and beautiful car trip.  My phone is currently in repairs after I accidentally spilled my beer on it yesterday and will not be able to take calls for a while.  If you have any questions feel free to Email me. ((END #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2 FROM SOURCE)) I understand that you would expect this report to be a hoax, but I'm dead serious, this has to be the strangest thing that's ever happened to me. ((END #2)) ((ADDENDUM #3 FROM SOURCE)) there is no one to my knowledge who saw it, when we got back home I had asked a few neighbors if they had seen what I had seen and told me I was crazy, I'm assuming they haven't seen It. I had my parents give me a run down of the whole situation, my father believes the craft may have been scanning us, my mother doesn't know what to think, but they don't want to be involved with the whole situation ((END #3))",

      "story": "Brightly lit triangle craft hovered 50 feet above roadway Spokane, WA. I was driving home on High Drive around 9:30 pm Wednesday Nov. 9, 2016, after having dinner in downtown Spokane when this incident occurred. I was headed east on High Drive and approaching the intersection of High Drive and Grand Boulevard when I saw this giant incredibly bright object in the sky that was immediately above the treetops about four blocks away. At first, I wasn't sure if it was a panel of stadium lights, but there's no stadium anywhere nearby. I live just a short distance from where this incident occurred, and I have been there thousands of times over the past 17 years, and I have never once seen a light like that anywhere in the neighborhood. I drove toward the object, and pulled over on the south side of East 43rd Avenue, between South Scott and South Garfield Streets. What I saw was a giant triangle that was only 50 feet or so above me, and hovering above some trees in a residential neighborhood. The object appeared to be about 180 feet long (half the distance between Scott Street and Garfield Street on 43rd Avenue) and 90 feet wide. There were white lights all the way around the sides of the triangle, and it was hovering in one place and didn't make any noise. Where I pulled over by the side of the road was almost directly underneath this triangle object, and I could see dark black circles on the underside. I turned my engine off, and watched this triangle object. There was absolutely no noise coming from it. Right after I pulled over, the thing started moving slowly from east to west. I reached in my purse to grab my cell phone so that I could take a picture, and I kept looking back at the triangle when suddenly it took off faster than anything ever seen my life. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen. When the object took off, it went west. It's speed was so fast that had I blinked my eyes, I would've missed it. The entire incident lasted about 10 minutes (9:30 to 9:40 pm). I know this because I had just looked at my dashboard clock as I approached the intersection of High Drive and Grand Boulevard, and I called my mother immediately afterward to tell her what I had seen. If I was to compare the size of the triangle from my perspective it to the size of a full moon, it was dozens if not hundreds of times bigger. If I was to compare the size of the triangle to my clenched fist held at arm's length, it was much, much larger. Although I was alone in my car, I am absolutely certain that there were other witnesses to this incident. When I reached the intersection of Grand Boulevard and High Drive at 9:30 pm, there were several Spokane Police officers standing in the flowerbeds of a private residence and talking to an older gentleman. They were parked in the driveway of the house on the north side of High Drive. They appeared to be looking for something in the flowerbeds adjacent to the roadway at a private home on the south side of High Drive. While I was parked on 43rd Avenue and watching the triangle, another car (vehicle #2) drove by my car. Vehicle #2 was headed east to west on 43rd Ave. and passed directly under this giant lighted triangle. I am absolutely certain the driver of Vehicle #2 saw the triangle, because it was brighter than any light I have ever seen. When I got home, I went to the Spokane News page on Facebook to see if anyone had posted anything about this. The only thing I found was a post about a car accident that occurred at 6 pm that night at the intersection of Grand Boulevard and High Drive. However, was no sign of any vehicle collision at that intersection at 9:30 pm, so I don't think the  triangle object is related to the car accident earlier that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone on two occasions, and she seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sincere.  We strongly suspect that she is a quite capable, and credible, witness.  PD))",

We had barbequed a turkey at my folks place southeast of Spokane, WA.  Most of my family was there, including two sisters, two B-i-l\u2019s, mom, dad (skeptic) and me.  My two sons had gone home to Washington earlier in the day.  Well, I like an occasional cigarette after dinner and Tim, my skeptical brother-in-law is a confirmed addict.  We went out on the back porch to smoke after dinner.  It was very dark, very clear, and cold.  I happened to look up and saw a white circular light/object moving from west to east and very high up (seemed to be anyway.)   This light was very much like one I\u2019d seen about 10 years ago in Fall City, WA. (reported to NUFORC) but seemed higher up.  If I hold my hand straight up and away, the object would have been about 1/8th of an inch or so wide.  Much bigger than any star.  Once again it appeared to be a weird, \u201cconfined\u201d light.  I immediately shouted \u201clook at that\u201d and pointed at it.  Tim looked up and didn\u2019t say anything, but he wa! s watching.  He saw it. The light approached a smaller, less well-defined white light that looked like a big star.  My first thought was \u201csatellite\u201d but the moving object seemed too big for that.  Then it slowed down and seemed to merge with the smaller light, then they both changed direction to the south and poof, they disappeared. Several observations:  It was much larger than any star in the sky and once again it was that weird, seemingly confined white light.  Not terribly bright, but very obviously moving.  If I pick a spot on the ceiling of my office, while sitting in my chair, the object would appear to have moved about 1 foot across the ceiling/starfield, if that makes sense. When we first saw it, it was moving, once again, in what seemed a purposeful way (we\u2019ve discussed this before) from west to east.  Tim saw it almost immediately after I did and we both saw it slow down and approach another light/object that was similar in color, but appeared smaller \u2013 maybe \u00bd the size.  They came together and became a single light/object \u2013 no size change.  Once they merged together, they turned but not in an immediate, 90 degree turn that is often described and seems physically impossible.  This was more gradual, as though going around a corner, but a sharp corner.  In the previous ceiling example, it would\u2019ve executed the turn over just a couple of inches.  Then it was moving to the south.  While we were both staring at it, it just blinked out.  Gone.  We waited a bit, looking, but no other objects appeared to be moving.  I asked him \u201cyou saw that didn\u2019t you!\u201d  He said \u201cyeah, I did\u2026.and it was weird.\u201d  He was obviously taken aback.  Not quite shaken really, but definitely weirded out.  I can\u2019t tell you how happy I was to have someone else see it.  We went back in and I told the group around table that we\u2019d seen a UFO!  We'd all had a couple of drinks and they all jeered a bit, of course, but I think that Tim\u2019s behavior caught them off guard.  They know him very, very well and know he\u2019d be jeering too if it hadn\u2019t been quite a sight.  It was that, alright.  I checked on the ISS and it was in the sky, but much later that night.  I also check flightaware, etc., there were airliners up of course, but this wasn\u2019t an airliner.  Airplanes don\u2019t slow down that way and then execute a quite sharp turn. It was almost an instantaneous 90 deg. turn, but not quite.  No noise of course.  Don\u2019t know what it was, but for now at least, we know it was a UFO.  I don\u2019t know if these things are extraterrestrial or not, but I would sure like to know. I need to report to Nurforc and will do so tonight.  Should\u2019ve called Peter D. before now, but was very busy and oddly, I didn\u2019t t! hink to do it immediately, nor did either of us think of trying to pull out a phone.  It was one of those things where we were both sort of stunned by what we were seeing.  I\u2019ll give it more thought and file a report with Nuforc and Mufon tonight.",
