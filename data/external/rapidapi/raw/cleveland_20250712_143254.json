There was a clear cloudless sky that day and it couldn't have been a cloud.  It was very distant, but it didn't seem to be moving.  I continued looking at the object when it changed colors: first to green, then to orange, then blue.   It began to float eastward, still changing colors, and then almost immeadiately turned south, an immeadiate 90 degree turn that no craft I can think of could handle. It floated away, southward, and eventually reached the horizon where it was out of view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

      "story": "Black rectangular shaped craft observed with night-vision equipment. No sound or lights! I was assigned to the local high school, as a Deputy Sheriff, to provide security for the school against student vandalism. While sitting in my patrol car I was using our night-vision monocular, which was issued to me for this assignment, to observe the sky as it was a clear morning. A few minutes later something dark in the sky caught my attention through the lens. This object was not visible to the naked eye, however, the night-vison unit accentuates any available light and this in-turn illuminated the stars brightly. The object was visible to me only because it blocked out the stars in the sky's background thus it was clearly and sharply defined although black in color.  The object was moving from West to East with absolutely no sound. My environment at the school parking lot was totally quiet with only an occasional passing car on Highway 129N which is located approximately 1,000 ft. from my location. The object had no lights and did not illuminate whatsoever.  The object's shape was something akin to a cross with two differences: 1. Picture a cross with the horizontal portion moved forward near the top but not quite. 2. There was another horizontal portion visible towards the rear. That portion was not as wide as the forward horizontal postion. Also, all portions, especially the horizontals, were about 25% broader than what you would expect on a standard (?) cross.  Obviously the size/altitude could not be determined, nor the speed. However, the night-vison I was using does not magnify and I would estimate that the apparent size from my view, if you took a coin in an outstretched hand, appeared about the size of a quarter-dollar.  My viewing time was around a couple of minutes. I lost sight of the object due to the awkward angle of trying to crane my neck from right to left as it moved across the sky. I exited my vehicle to further look for it, however I could not.  As a retired professional pilot of 20 years . . .I have seen many things I could not immediately explain, however, none of them remained a mystery for more than a few minutes.  This object is absolutely un-explainable to me and I have had two years to ponder it. I DO NOT believe in extraterrestrial craft at this point and I am certainly a dyed-in-the-wool skeptic on such matters. I cannot conceive of a rational explanation.

      "story": "Private Pilot/Amateur Astronomer Witnesses Satellite-like Object Make 2 Course Corrections Not too long after sunset, with a very few broken clouds illuminated by street lights, a bright white light was noticed overhead while stargazing. It was similar to a typical satellite in its appearance and speed and it tracked rapidly on a heading of about 100 degrees; just a little to the right of due east.  The brightness was steady and there were no rotating beacons, sound, nor change of colors noticed. The object tracked at about 100 degrees for approximately one minute, then angled to a new heading of approximately 120 degrees.  It remained on this heading for only about 30 seconds when it made another angular change to a heading of about 140 degrees, where it was at an elevation of about 45 degrees or thereabout. The object dimmed after about 15 seconds and was no longer visible.  It did not go behind a cloud.  From this, I gathered that it was a reflected light and the object dimmed as it moved into the earth's shadow.  This meant that the object was at considerable altitude and, by the short duration, was traveling rapidly. Being a private pilot, an amateur astronomer and general skeptic, I chose to report this sighting as something truly beyond anything I have ever witnessed in the sky at night.

We were in Garfield Hts., Ohio at the time sitting on the back porch. \tWe got a pair of binoculars to take a closer look.  It was not an airplane.  It was an unidentifiable object, actually hovering very slowly moving from the western sky towards the northwest. \tIt first seemed to hover for at least an hour and finally started moving.  Through the binoculars, it first looked to me like an arrow or V shape with red, blue and white lights.  Then it changed to a circular shape with red lights on the left and blue lights on the right and white lights in the middle.  It was constantly blinking and twinkling.  My friend saw pretty much the same thing, but what she called concentrated energy force streaming from the blue and red lights.  She said it looked like a see-through bubble with white veins going around it.  She had contacts in, and I didn\u2019t.

I shot footage off and on for about 2 hours until it was light outside witch made it hard to see, then all the sudden I heard a roar in the sky to the south, as I looked That direction I seen what apeared to be a fighter jet with the afterburners on heading straight At it. It looked like the sphere started moveing north away from it as the fighter got close to it It went straight up over the top of the fighter jet and then apeared to back the other direction,  The fighter tryed to turn at that moment but couldn't turn that sharp and over shot the ufo so far  Because of the speed by the time it came back around the ufo was gone it just shot straght up in Sky until it was out of sight.

I have served on a U.S. Aircraft carrier and i have seen many planes.  The movements were slow then fast, sharp direction changes in Z, S and O patterns.  I would say that it had a 20,000 to 40,000 ceiling, but various and unknown with the naked eye.  No telescope or binoculars available.  My friend arrived at 22:30 EST USA and witnessed this as well and she hates to agree with me, but is 100% in agreement with me.  No sound was heard, a green hue was seen but it was very high up.

It had yellow and red flashing lights around the outer edge. It hovered silently across the street from the house. Low in the sky and very visible. There were no windows or anything like an undercarriage. Absolutely no noise and for awhile no movement. Incidentally, across the street from the house was the TRW Valve Division. I usually suspect that often these crafts are not so much otherworldly as they are from a foreign country. Quite possibly this was a spycraft taking pictures of TRW as they manufactured defense components etc. Just my suspicion in this instance, as the craft was hovering above a factory right next to TRW. After approx. 4 minutes, it silently left at great speed in a southwest direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

After watching a show about alien sightings on tv for about two days on tv and the next couple of days there are there bodies painted on the driveway.  It seems to be three painted shapes of the aliens, according to the television show, and they have three heads seems like they are walking all together and the heads are all in a line in straight row and the bodies seem like they are floating on a cloud or showing something that floating, and the three bodies are directly above the scratching of(alot of paint) showing of something floating. The bodies are thin and and seem like they are all walking. There are no arms just a dot and straight long line the part attached to the head is one straight line and the last two lines are the legs spread apart as if they are walking.   I just thought it seems funny and this picture is painted on the parking lot of all silver paint (alien paint maybe or of some chemical.  It's not real messy, but it is big enough that peo! ple were scare to park their cars there.   The the direction of the picture had to come from directly above my apartment.  The three aliens had to have landed on the roof top and make this picture.  The picture is pointed directly towards my window.  The silver paint is nothing like I've seen it.   I don't think it can be removed.  I think it has to be completely painted over or dug up to remove the object shape on the ground.  The whole complex has to of seen this object or painting in the driveway.  The channel that I seen this television show is the history channel about the aliens. I believe this is an contact from the other side. When I took the pictures, I feel really funny after I took the picture.  Thanks for letting me report this.",

      "story": "Fireball like object flying east to west along shoreline near downtown Cleveland I am an EMS helicopter pilot in the Cleveland Ohio area with a two nurse crew this morning.  We had just dropped off a patient on the rooftop helipad of a hospital three miles east of downtown Cleveland and were preparing to depart for base when all three of us witnessed a \"fireball like\" object. At approximately 1:50 AM, July 4th, 201, I was preparing for engine start when I observed this fireball like circular object flying from east to west just north of our position.  It appeared closest when I first saw it.  This is an area of intense air traffic so it took a second look to determine it did not look like an airplane.  At this particular time of morning there were no other aircraft seen. I immediately jumped out of the cockpit and went back to the crew loading our equipment and told them check this out.  All three of us watched the object fly over the shoreline at approximately 3000 to 4000 ft.  Maybe a speed of 150kts at least.  We tried to determine if it was an airliner as this is the same area they fly on their approach to Cleveland Hopkins airport.  However there were no position lights and no strobes.   We could not see any structure except for the roundness and color.  It was a yellow golden sphere with red on the sides (See drawing).  The bright red seemed to have the characteristic of fire or vertical flames but was not flames.  It was not underneath only on the sides with a little on the top.  It was like red electrical fire.  It did not look like jet propulsion. I am not an artist but I did attempt to draw what I saw and that is included here.  I would estimate a fairly good sized object, at least 10-20 feet across.  It flew east to west over the shoreline.  As it approached downtown proper it turned northwest and departed out over the lake at a constant altitude and airspeed.

Just started doing this 2 months ago when we got news were pregnant again (our 2nd).  I've been using this time to stare at the stars and honestly bask in what I see as God's beautiful creation.  I'm a life long Christian that doesn't rule out UFO's/Aliens b/c I find comfort in knowing mankind truly doesn't have all the knowledge of our Lords magnitude.  No drugs, No boose, just cigs.  I noticed multiple (3) airplanes flying overhead that night as per the norm during the first cig, and saying thank you Jesus as I looked from star to star giving Him the glory.  Sets my soul at ease anywho.....  While doing this for one set of stars (3*) above my neighbors house (NE) for a couple of minutes or 1/2 cigarette. Spending about 1 minute thank the Lord for each one. When I got to the 3rd star and did the same.  Just a few seconds later I then noticed it, the &quot;star&quot; (round) start to slowly move north.  Separating itself from the other 2 apparently out of nowhere, meaning it was fixed in the sky while looking at the other two.  It was equal to size, color, and intensity as the other two stars that stayed put.  After about 2 minutes of it slowly moving I noticed it began to become darker, as if the power was cut in half to the light (absolutely no flashing, no color other than white, no flickering).  Then the last minute it maintained the same speed and simply disappeared.  No clouds in the sky.  No ridge line to block view.  The thought to be star for 3 minutes before movement simply disappeared 3 total minutes later. It wasn't a shooting star.  I have seen plenty of those in my lifetime, nor a airplane.  They are starkly different of course to my description.  This makes just the second time in my life I've ever had such an experience.  I was 7 years old when something similar to this happened to me before but it was during the day.  Although I did see the &quot;cigar shaped&quot; slow flying object reported here locally about 2 weeks ago as well I was told it was a chinese satellite re-entering the orbit by a classmate and wrote it off.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist that's scared of stuff I don't understand.  Just wanted to share this with someone other than my wife.  Take care guys-gals and God Bless.",

I was driving East on the Route 2 Shore-way, coming from Cleveland, OH going towards my home in Madison OH.  It was about 2:30 in the afternoon. (Route 2 runs along Lake Erie.) I noticed a huge oval cloud (kind of shaped like a mushroom without the stem) over the lake as if a storm were brewing.  It caught my eye because I noticed a small white orb/teardrop shape with a white trail dropping down out of the cloud, straight down into the lake, or what looked like the lake because it was so far away.  At first I thought I was seeing things and then another one dropped out of the cloud, straight down as the previous one had done, dropping into the lake.   Two more of these white orbs/teardrops followed one after the other.  I didn\u2019t notice a splash because #1 I was driving on a crowded highway and #2 the cloud was far off, probably closer to Canada.!  The weather was hot and humid, but there were some storm clouds way out over Lake Erie.  The size of the orb/teardrop was (to me) about the size of a pencil tip, maybe a little bigger.  I had my windows up with the a/c set to 2 and therefore I have no idea if there was an accompanying noise.   I am a 55-year old woman who doesn\u2019t see things like this but I thought that it was odd enough that I should report it to someone just in case others saw the same thing I did.",

Sighted a stationary object well above lower puffy cloud line almost directly over head in the east. Clear blue sky back round.Distance was great very high in the sky, actually made it look small. Description of craft: Shape: Triangle. Composition: all 3 sides of the triangle looked like white cloudy field that held its straight line shape to form the triangle.  But the white cloudy field did have fluctuation and movement within itself like a shifting and re-arranging constant.  At the top where the two longest sides of the triangle met was a very bright round shinning prism of beaming light.  Craft stayed stationary but made movement in its one spot.  Oddly enough it was as if it was putting on a show.  The craft looked as though it was flipping (turning) slowly in a timed sequence over and over again.  Each time it would flip backwards away from me the prism light went out of sight then return once it was flipped toward me and back at the top of the triangle.   Also the white cloudy fields that made the triangle line configuration would slightly dissolve themselves but immediately return their shape and consistency while craft was in motion turning over a flipping over.  It seemed it was getting smaller  and farther away as the minutes passed.  It then slowly seemed to go to a range distance I could no longer view.

Normally we get a lot of airplane traffic above our house as the airport is about 15 miles away at most so I always look in the sky to see if there is anything out of the ordinary. I was looking up at the sky and walking onto the porch when I noticed an orange star. I went over the the north side of the porch which faces toward downtown and went to go look at the star again. I suddenly noticed this orange/red orange star was moving. It was very high in the sky, and very very light. It was moving straight and made no sound. All of a sudden it ballooned into three orange objects like when a firework explodes and rains down. The objects then made a 360 and at that point I thought they would hit each other and that they could be military aircraft. But they didn't and they seemed to be racing. But the further away they moved the harder it was to see them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

It headed back to that same point of the northeast sky that bright light would \u201cenhance\u201d for lack of a better word then fade then begin the same circling routine all over again this went on about fifteen times and as I watched it, at one point I thought I could see a massive ship through the clouds but I can\u2019t make that my claim as of today but that made me \u201cthink\u201d that those lights where coming from the front of the ship. After about the fifteenth circle the ship flew away so fast heading east leaving a line of smoke in the sky.  I\u2019ve seen a different kind of ship flying around in that same exact area a few years ago this ship was not circling as far out as the ship that I saw last night, it had sort of a search light on it, as if it was a car in the sky with its high beams on circling and circling.   It was moving much faster and then it just faded away into the clouds it was in plain sight anyone could have just looked up and saw it me and my daughter watched it until it faded away.

I pulled over and rolled down the window to get a better look.   By this time, the bright light had dimmed.  The object was alone and hovering.  Sitting completely still and showing some red, green, and white lights.  The lights moved in a pattern across the back side of the object.   Less than a minute went by and the object started moving away from me.  I turned around and started driving east after the object before I had traveled 5 miles, the object was out of sight.

Out of nowhere, the bright orange light appeared.  Small at first, but I thought maybe it was a planet (saturn, venus)and that the clouds moved away.  But the orange light grew bigger, then hung in the sky right in front of my house, above some pine trees.  If I had to estimate the distance, it was probably about where a helicopter would fly.   The orange light was like a fireball so I thought maybe it was a meteor but it didn't move.   It also looked like it had an orange light beam coming from it.  Its shape was almost like that of a flood light, like square cylinder shape but fiery orange.  I ran to get my camera, and of course, just like on tv shows, my camera froze.  It gave me a creepy feeling, like it was observing me.   I then noticed it started to shrink, but then realized it wasn't shrinking, it was heading west. It had to have been moving quickly to shrink out of site! that fast.   I am about 4 blocks from Lake Erie and it was heading west.  I just didn't feel right, didn't seem like a natural phenomenon.  Very strange and uneasy feeling..",

Roughly 10:00 pm EST, on August 20, 2014, my boyfriend and I saw what appeared to be a bright star/sphere like light object, traveling from the west heading east across the sky.  The visibility of the sky was completely clear of any clouds, making all the stars and airplanes visible to the naked eye.   The appearance of the object my boyfriend and I saw was much brighter, and larger than any star.  The object was traveling at the rate of which seemed to be a fast airplane, but had no blinking lights, as all of the airplanes seen in the sky flying at the same time had.   The object headed to what seemed to be directly across the sky right over us, bearing no sound, and suddenly appeared to change direction heading  south in the sky; away from us, toward a star in the sky.  We continued to watch it closely, almost in dismay; captivated, as the object still had no sign of any blinking lights and had no change in its form; staying a consistent bright sphere of light.   The object appeared to then not just be flying south, but straight up toward the star just south of us.  As we watched my my boyfriend stated \u201clook it\u2019s starting to fade\u201d, and then right before our eyes  the object just disappeared; which happened in seconds. I was absolutely dumbfounded, the object appeared to be there in the sky one moment and then what I would describe as it telescoping, farther straight up in the sky, and as it did so, it seemed to have a reddish color as it vanished into the sky.  Something like out of a movie, as a star ship might go into hyper drive, and all you see is the afterburners of its jets. The whole occurrence lasted about 60 seconds, to a minute and a half long.  Regretfully, I have no footage as my boyfriend and I describe  to one another as being memorized, trying to figure out what exactly it was we were looking at, which when the object eerily disappeared in seconds from the sky, we had both agreed that what we had just seen was a UFO.",

After clearing the warning buoys in the bay we proceeded out and head due west at full speed. We were heading for the 2 large islands on the west end of the lake. The trip would take apx 35-40 minutes. The sun had not come up yet but as it did begin to rise we took a few pics (Iphone 5S) (while moving). I was driving the boat, but at a slow speed. I turned around to snap a few pics of the sun which was in full beautiful view, and ended up with an excellent picture of the sunrise. at this point we were well out on the lake with only the water around us and the sky above. A week later as I was reviewing my pictures and posting them to facebook, I noticed that I had captured something in the picture that we were not aware of during the fishing trip. The object is on the far left middle of the pic, and appears higher than us and above the water. The picture does not show the entire craft, only a portion of it...but you can see structure to it, and It has  definite angles to the design, and you can see the rising sun shining on it / illuminating it. We heard nothing that morning except the wind, waves and the roar of the boats motor. We saw nothing other than the sunrise... I have zoomed in on the object and it is not a \"normal\" saucer shaped UFO, but it does have well defined surfaces that reflect light. The ufo appears to be following or passing us on the starboard side of the boat and behind us apx 100 yards?. There were 3 others in the boat with me, and subsequently i requested copies of their pics. In 1 of those other pictures taken apx 3 mins prior to my photo i found a picture of the sunrise that also includes the skies and the clouds behind us. Upon zooming in there appears to be an octagon shaped object in the clouds. I \"theorize\" it traveled from the clouds to a position behind us in a matter of 3 minutes.

The UFOs came from east to west of downtown Cleveland, the height was about 6,000ft, the speed was about a helicopters speed.   Here's what happened:  I looked up at the sky and the UFOs almost 20 of them visible to me, were behind each other in a very organized way.  As the group of UFOs were moving, they had a blue looking light next to them.  While the rest of the aircrafts/UFOs were leaving I tried to take pictures of them, but I only caught two on my camera; they headed north above Lake Erie, my estimation is that they went up to 10,000 ft and higher where it isn't visible to a human eye.  I tried to record all this and when I went back on my gallery the video was gone, I was pretty sure I took.  My friend sent me the pictures she took, instead.

      "story": "Caught two bright UFOs. Strange smaller objects seemed to appear out of nowhere nearby, ONLY in the pictures! I looked out my window at 2:00am witnessing a bright light in the sky between an opening through the leaves of a large tree in my backyard.  The light was larger than any star in the sky.  It was larger than any visible planet.  As I watched it, I noticed it was moving.  With the help of the leaves, I could tell the pace of the movement more easily, because it disappeared behind the leaves.  It moved faster than stars in the sky, but much slower than airplanes, satellites, etc. So, I grabbed my good camera and tripod and ran to my back porch.  I found openings between leaves and branches by standing, kneeling and in between then adjusted my tripod, zoomed in 30x, and began snapping pictures.  It seemed to first be moving upwards in the sky. So I would have to adjust my tripod higher up.  Then it started on a slow path downward on what I believe was about a 150-160 degree angle.  Eventually it seemed to stop and go straight downward, at a 90 degree angle, for the remainder of the sighting.  I ended up having my tripod go from all the way down, to all the way up, then all the way down again. I almost felt like the object wanted to observe something on the ground, maybe the nearby airport, or maybe the NASA Glenn Research Center, within 5-7 miles south of the objects.  It moved slowly enough for most to not think twice when seeing it, maybe thinking it is just a large bright star.  Although it was definitely larger and closer than even the largest star that can ever be observed in the sky, from the ground that is.  I have been studying UFOs and E.T.s  for a year now, since my first sighting.  So I definitely noticed that I was seeing something different here.  I see things all of the time but this is by far one of the coolest sightings I have had. I focused on this object that usually remained red and blue in the pictures pulsating fast in a pattern of red, white, blue.  What I found very strange, were these smaller copper/silver colored objects that appeared only in the photos near the main object. I did not see these objects myself at all, but they were obviously there.  Then I noticed another object very similar to the main one I was already snapping photos of.  This one however, seemed to be blinking fast between the main colors of orange/red, white and yellow rather than red, white and blue.  The last photo attached is of the orange object. I observed these objects between 2-3am. I do not know of a man made or known space object that moves the speed and direction that it did and looks like the pictures I have attached.  The whole time I felt that I was witnessing something really special.",

      "story": "3 red light triangle which broke into single lights then more red lights and a possible bigger craft. Saturday, 8/24/19, 9:40pm EDT over the West Side of Cleveland.  I was sitting outside doing a fire pit in my back yard with one of my neighbors.  I'm in the West Park area of Cleveland, but almost in Brook Park, not far from Hopkins Airport.  My neighbor was sitting facing the right direction, ENE, to see it first. I was facing N.  She said, \"Hey, look at THAT, behind the trees!\"  There was a triangular formation of 3 steady solid red lights.  I'd guess ENE at about 55 degrees on the compass, and maybe 25-30 degrees above the ground.  I think the triangle was pointing down, with the 2 lights on top, and 1 below.  Was so excited, I don't remember for sure, but definitely was a triangle.  She can't recall either. The formation finally came over the trees, but was much higher up, going WSW about 250 degrees and seemed high in the sky.  They were completely silent.  Took maybe a minute or less to transverse the sky, I don't know how high up they were. I would say the triangle was the width of 2 full moons.  The formation broke up into the lights being side by side  after being just overhead, but a little to the north, and got dimmer and somewhat translucent as it went toward the WSW.  2 more red lights came from the ENE, side by side, and went the same way, then 2 more dimmer ones the same way.  Then my neighbor then said, \"Look\", pointing slightly in the WSW direction, I couldn't see it. maybe my eyes couldn't adjust looking over the bright fire pit, but she said a round red light maybe 20X as big, she called it \"the mother ship\" but she said it was very dim and could hardly see it herself, with the other red lights surrounding it, all moving WSW and just faded as to the WSW she said.  I thought all the lights were faded and gone by the tine she seen the big dim one.  Looked to me on the ones I could see, they were going just maybe slightly north of Hopkins Airport and still high in the sky. The West Side and maybe downtown had to see it.  I tried video recording it on my phone, but my screen was pitch black, phone not good in the dark.  Later on I seen at one point I got 2 faint dots, what I assume were the top 2 lights, the bottom light must have been hidden by the trees.  That's all I got as nothing showing in my viewing screen to aim at as it was moving.",

I ran outside to see and it was the cargo plane but it now has green lights on it.  Very strange.  Cargo planes have red lights.   Some friends of mine came by last night to visit and they mentioned to me that they were out the other evening and seen a huge drone the size of a full size pickup flying from the high country over to the feilds where I live. It was quiet according to my friends.  It then flew back over the mountain.  The drone I seen was big.  Maybe the size of two full size pickups.",
