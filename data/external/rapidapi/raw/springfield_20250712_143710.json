What we saw looked like a movie screen shaped object, most definitely a rectangle.  It was silent, stopped above us at a height of about 2-300 feet and stayed motionless above us, but running through a number of beautiful colors.  Some of us panicked, but I was just generally curious about this event.   After just an minute or two, it slowly and silently retreated in no particular rush.   That's it, just a rectangular screen about 50 ft x 100 ft producing an incredible display of colors from across the spectrum.

Within 5 seconds it was hovering right over me.  It's flight patterns in the sky was unlike anything I've ever seen.  It moved in circles, it would hover low, then back up high again repeatedly.   Once the object decided to stop hovering above me, It was out of my eye sight in a matter of seconds,  I watched it until it left. It felt as if I was staring at it for a very long time (probably because I was awe) but it was only a minute.  I've never seen anything like this,  I'm a UFO sceptic but I saw something, something that wasn't of this Earth and I cannot explain to myself, so I'm here posting this.

MO near Glenstone and Grand on the very night of the Lunar Eclipse and Hale-Bopp. On the very night of the Lunar Eclipse, while Hale-Bopp was still in the sky, we were cooking outside and watching the sky because the Eclipse was getting ready to take place. I had the urge to look up into the south sky (opposite direction from the comet) and saw what to the best of my recollection was either the front of a disc or a large batman type of wing floating overhead. I called loudly to my husband to come out and witness this, as I knew he would not believe me. He came out just in time to see the craft go over the house to the north. It was above the streetlight and it appeared to be round. While it was overhead, it was not visible, as though looking only at the sky. It could only be seen on the cusps of the craft. It flew off and curved right away to the northwest after passing over our home. I watched the news that night hoping others may have seen this, but there were no reports of it. My husband at the time was teaching at a local college. The next day he asked if anyone had seen anything odd the night before, whereupon one did tell that he and his girlfriend also saw something similar in the sky the prior evening, while watching for the eclipse. The thing that was confusing to me was that, in my mind, an object that appeared that size would fall out of the sky, were it flying so smoothly and at such a low speed. It seemed to be on cruise at a low speed. The only other solution to this speed is that it could have been much larger and much higher, appearing smaller and closer. However, we could see the streetlight in front of our house reflecting onto the back of the cusp or disc as it flew off. I have tried to do a search on the internet to see if others spotted this ufo during the Eclipse and Hale-Bopp, however, the only other thing I have found was references to Heaven's Gate. I/we were never in the slightest interested in cults. I have thought of this many times and hoped others had seen the ufo on that very night and also wondered if they, whoever they are, intentional! ly flew the craft that very night because they knew people would be watching the eclipse that night. Was it some kind of a test to see if people would report it?",

At 5:00am on January 8, 2008 I stepped outside to get a.m. newspaper and looked up when I heard a low droning noise above.  Sound was much lower than typical aircraft that pass over, and not as loud as jets or c-5 aircraft that I am familiar with hearing.  The morning sky was crystal clear as was evident when a shooting star passed directly under the object I saw and was very bright, and there were many stars out.  An object was approaching from the west and moving toward south east.  The object above looked to be approximately the width of five C-5 aircraft and was moving very slowly.  I saw one large central light, that appeared to have more than one color and on either side of the center light there were 4 smaller lights, spaced out at regular intervals of perhaps 200 ft  between and 1 light off the right side set back and apart from the rest.  All moved at the same uniform speed while approaching me and moving over me.  The lights were dim, as if behind a cloud, although there appeared to be no clouds in the area.  I assumed it was very high in the sky.  I cannot estimate height, but from where I stood it appeared to be the width above mentioned.  I was unable to see a distinct form of airplane(s), only the light formations.  I initially though that perhaps this was a large aircraft with jets flying on the sides in formation, however, the object remained in the same configuration while it passed over me, and after passing directly over the 8 lights on either side of the main central light started to change configuration in that they circled around each other, but remained at the same speed as the object.   I then thought that there were no way these were jets flying in formation because the lights could not have circled around each other.  They continued to do this until they were too far off in the horizon for me to see.",

I called for my wife thru our patio door and asked her to come and look at some object and tell me what she thought. I pointed to it and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is, but it is not moving at all and maybe it is a big balloon\u201d. My wife then went and got me our binoculars so we could take a better look.  WoW, came out of my mouth while looking at it, as it was visibly quite large, circular with a weird combination of red-green-silver haze around it. I then gave the binoculars to my wife and said, \u201cYou got to take a look at this\u201d. Well, to say we were both astonished is an understatement.  The object remained stationary for another 25-30 minutes and then started moving directly north at a very slow pace and in fact so slow that I initially thought it had stopped moving again. As the object moved northerly the red-silver glow was more apparent and the greenish hue totally disappeared.  I watched the object for a good 40 minutes and I still do not understand what I was looking at, but I can definitely tell you it was NOT a balloon or any type of man made aircraft including a helicopter at that height.  I am still stunned thinking about it and wanted to report it accordingly. My wife and I have never seen anything like this and we both thought it should be reported, discreetly. I again want to state that this object was extremely large and far bigger than any airliner I have ever observed at that height.",

      "story": "Glowing light orb/disk behind cloud: light oval shape every 9 - 10 seconds would appear I went out to share a cigarette with my girlfriend.  As we are sharing a cigarette, she tells me to look in a certain direction of the sky.  I think I was looking WEST.  I was the same direction as going on Route 124 or 24 West.  It would be easier to draw.  But there was a big shiny, what looked to be a star.  Biggest and brightest I have seen.  Then there was a little dot or light to the right of it.  My girlfriend went in and I kept looking at it bc there was something different about it.  As I was focusing on it, I saw, what could have been an orb or something making me realize it may be a shape.  I saw twinkling light appear on this outline where it connected the big shiny star and the other small tiny light towards and parrallel to it.  This last about 10 minutes.  I went back inside to get my girlfriend to see that if you look, there are little light going around and connecting at those points giving it the shape of an oval or disk or something.  My girlfriend was already laying in bed and didn't want to get up.  I figured maybe it was nothing.  What are the chances?  I went inside, got some money to walk across the street and get some coffee.    When I came back outside, I didn't see it anymore.  I looked over to the EAST to see if I saw a particular star that was present before and it was moved, but still there.  Most stars were still there as the 10 minutes past.  But didn't see the object.  Then realized there was cloud cover in that area.  So I chalked it down to it did not move, but was just being covered by some clouds.  It may move some but should be close to the orginal positon bc not much time did pass.  Maybe 10-15 minutes.  After getting some coffee and a dougnut, I headed back, but decided to have another cigarette and see if the cloud cover passes bc I want to find that image again.  I wasn't that patient and just said, it is the cloud cover.  But then as I am looking in the sky, saying I wish I didnt go to get coffee and doughnuts, I noticed behind the clouds there was some light or haze creating what looked to be a disk or orb.  I counted that every 9 or 10 seconds, the lightt would go around.  Looked like there was searchlights, but it didnt go into the sky.  It was behind the cloud, and looked liked a cir! cle.  I went inside and yelled and my gf to get up and look, but she did not bc I went right back out there.  I rubbed my eyes.  I looked again and confirmed tro myself what I am seeing.  Except the big light that happened on the 9th or 10th second.  Then saw the outline of a disk lighted up expect was not the same in light intensity.  Resembled the shape seen before expect not so visible.  I went back to my house which is about 2 minutes away and found this website.  I first called, but then was requested to write on this site.  I collected my thoughts.   Went back to see what I saw and it wasn't there anymore.  I went back home and tried calling the FAA in Newark.  The line was busy.  Tried for about 30 minutes.  Wanted to know if they were AWARE OR WAS HAVING SEARCHLIGHT ETC.  I tried to get it with my phone.  Haven't seen it yet.  Behind the clouds  I did see other aircraft that were planes in the area, but nothing like thaT",

It had what appeared to be an oval shape and had strobe lights that changed from red, green, blue, and white. While sitting in the same spot for the first fifteen minutes, from the edges of the craft it emitted round bright white balls of light. These balls would come out of the craft horizontally then disappear altogether. This happened a total of four times then no more came out.  I called a friend to confirm what I was seeing, and she saw another one to the south of Springfield. Oval in shape but turned upright. With the same colored strobes as the one above. No balls of light came from the second craft.  To ensure it was not moving I placed a couple of pieces of tape on the glass surrounding the object and watched from the same location. The stars were of course slowly dropping below the tape line but not this object.  The one to the south of Springfield had a bright flash that was produced several times from the craft. Similar to a camera flash at night.  We watched both objects from 04:00 hours until they went dark suddenly at around 04:47. We could not figure out if they left or just went dark and remained in the same location.",

      "story": "12:15 AM March 6, 2008  I was driving back home from my brother\u2019s apartment in Alexandria, VA right around midnight when I saw this object. I was driving west on the Fairfax County Parkway into Springfield where my parents live when I noticed an unusually bright air plane about 35 degrees from the horizon in the west/north-west region of the sky. Living in Springfield I am located between two major airports; Washington International, and Dulles.  Seeing many air planes in the Northern Virginia sky is extremely common, air traffic is quite busy in this area. However, at night air planes have a distinct brightness and have flashing lights on the wings to identify commercial air craft, and are not hard to determine. The craft I saw was about four to five times brighter than the other air planes in the sky and had a golden white light emitting from all sides. I did not see any blinking lights that resembled the lights on regular air planes. There were commercial airplanes flying in other parts of the sky during the sighting so I could tell that this craft appeared quite different.  Continuing my route home, I noticed that I was getting much closer to the object. It appeared to have been flying close to the Fairfax County Parkway. I also remember that I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off it, it seemed too bright and was moving way to slow and just seemed out of place. It was approximately 5 minutes after initially spotting it that I got close enough to it that I could see that it was not a helicopter. It was also silent; I couldn\u2019t hear any engine sounds of any kind. It seemed to have been flying over the neighborhood near Hunt Valley elementary school before I saw it slowly cross over the Fairfax County Parkway.  I drove right underneath the craft as it crossed over the road right by the Sunoco gas station located on the Gambrill road exit ramp. When I was approaching the craft just before driving directly underneath it I could tell that this object was about 250-300 feet off the ground and was moving at maybe 50-100 mph. I remember stretching my neck out of my window to get a closer look at it when it silently floated across the parkway, and over the neighborhood on the other side. While looking at the craft from underneath, it looked like a diamond shape but with an elongated front point. I could not see any wings, granted it was dark out, but I was able to see that the whole craft had a white-ish yellow glow with two yellow point lights close together that did not blink on the underside. I would estimate from the distance it looked in the air, that the size of this object was anywhere between 70 to 90 feet long and about 20 feet wide. After it crossed over the parkway, I kept turning my head back and saw it fly barely over the tree line bordering that neighborhood. I tried to keep my eye on it as I was just about home. When I turned off the parkway onto the Hooes road exit I could still see it barely above the trees, and still so bright. I lost sight of it as I turned into my neighborhood across the bridge from the fire station. I would say that I lost sight of it as it was somewhere above the Newington Forest area. This object seemed to be flying too low and too slow to be passenger airliner or single passenger plane.",

It was, at first I thought it was a helicopter or something and went back to watching some tv. What caught my attention again was the bright light was still there, this time it was a little closer and it seemed to 'hover' in place. I then got up, my curiousity grown, to inspect it. When I went upon our back porch. It was in the Northwest of the sky of our backyard. It wasnt cloudy, stars and the moon was out. You could see it through our full grown green ash tree. I also noticed that some of the lights from the other 5 houses were out, when usually you can see then on. Come to think about it, there was no stars, moon or any other light showing but just that one. Also this 'light' or UFO made no noise at all. I saw the light move really slow to the right bout a quarter of a inch.  Then it stopped and hovered. I stayed staring at it, thinking what in the heck is it? I called my mom out to c this after it just stayed for over 5 mintues in its spot. She came out, asking 'what?'. I pointed to the white light and she said it was probably a plane or helicopter. \"Mom, its just been hovering there\" She kept saying it was just one of the two until a couple mintues passed and the white light turned from white to a blue, green then back to white. We waited until it moved a bit and then stopped once again. By that time I ran inside and got my parents digital camcorder, my digital camera and my bioniclars. I brought them out and managed to film the white light. For some reason, my digital camera refused to work but the camcorder did, although at 1st it didnt want to, It even had a full battery.  While I was doing that, my mom watched and noticed it dart to the right really fast then stopped. I felt really excited cing this. I stopped filming and handed over the camcorder and picked my bioniclars up. I couldnt at first see any good image just that strange really bright white light. I brought the bioniclars down and stared as my mother and I spoke softly while keeping a eye on the light. When I put the bioniclars up once again the lights flashed from white, blue, green, yellow and white again. Althought this time, I managed to see a small shape with the white light. It looked like a trianglar shape to me 3 lights. The other two seemed like it was under more than the one we were seeing. Soon my dad, brother and his girlfriend came out and also saw the white light but couldnt see the shape I did.  After a while we just went inside but I called KOLR10 News to see if they knew anything and got told they would look into it. I hope we can find out what that strange light was.  I could still see it hovering for a hour and the last time I went to spy on it, the white light had completely vanished. After it left, all the lights came on and the stars and moon came right back out, like nothing happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

I was in my school's marching band and we were having a rehearsal outside on our football field, it was around 8:00 at night and it was mostly dark, because I think that the sun had set by then.   Our football field is laid out so that the end zones face north-to-south, and there is a set of bleachers on the west side of the field.   We were marching in a way such that the entire band was facing the west, towards the bleachers.  While we were marching I noticed a bright green spherical light source move from behind the bleachers, form the west or southwest, and move northwards and upwards so that the light source was, from my perspective, north of the bleachers and slightly above them, I'm guessing 1 to 1.5 miles away from the field.   The light source paused for about 4 seconds, not getting any brighter or fainter, which meant it was probably holding its position relative to me.   I stopped marching when I saw the light source appear.  For those 4 seconds a friend of mine who was also marching (he was a few yards away from me in the same formation), took notice of the light source and stopped marching as well.   After about 4 seconds the light source suddenly began moving away from us, towards the southwest, and increasing in altitude.  The source appeared to leave a small trail in the sky, most likely just a blur because of the speed at which it was moving.  Within about a second the light source was out of view.   My friend confirmed that he had also seen the object, and also described the things above.  If I were to estimate, I would say that the light source was about 80-100 feet in diameter.   The light source did nothing when it was hovering, making no known sound, not changing brightness, emitting nothing.  My friend and I seem to be the only people in the marching band that had seen the light source, even though it was plainly visible.   We have asked around, and nobody else claims to have seen it.  We have not done any research to find of anyone in the area had reported the sighting of ! the ligh t source.   This was one year ago; we didn't report this at the time because nobody else had seen it, so we dismissed the event as just an illusion.   But recently I watched a TV program that reminded me of the event, and I asked my friend if he still remembers the event, which he still does.  We've only decided to report it now.   Both of our stories have remained unchanged, and we both can recall the event very clearly and mutually.",

I am interested in these paranormal things so I continued to watch it. It suddenly disappeared and reappeared a little way to the right of the original location. Surprised by this i pulled the truck over to continue watching. Suddenly the ball of light exploded into about ten balls of light.  These all then collected into one ring that started to move.  It stayed like this for about ten seconds then the lights went out. Due to ambient light i was still able to see the craft though.  It was metallic, but looked like a motherboard in texture.  I watched it of a couple more seconds before it too was gone. I called multiple people to tell them what i saw.

The location of this sighting was the same as the 4/17/05 reported sighting, the UIS soccer fields, and it again occurred during daylight hours.  It was a very clear day with blue skies and little to no clouds, in the middle of the afternoon.  My 7-year old daughter and I had just finished shooting a model rocket several times and had no more engines left, so we sat down under some trees to relax before making the walk back to our car. My daughter joked that perhaps we would see a UFO since I had spotted some unknown object(s) in the sky at the same place, roughly two years ago, when we'd been flying kites. It, unfortunately, has become a family joke.  As we sat under the trees, she joked about some flying insects being UFOs and pointed to a passing jet or two. After a minute or so, she pointed and said, \"What is that white ball following that jet?\" I looked at the commercial jet that was flying overhead, and there was what appeared to be a ball of white vapor alongside the jet's vapor trail.  This ball of what appeared to be white smoke or vapor was about the same width as the jet itself, or perhaps a little wider.  The odd thing was that this ball appeared to be following the jet. It did not stay stationary in the sky as if it were just part of the vapor trail. Instead, it followed alongside the vapor trail behind the jet, traveling at what appeared to be the same speed as the jet, maintaining a constant distance.  We both stood up and walked out from under the trees to watch this object follow the jet until they both disappeared into the distance and out of view in the western sky. We were facing east when the jet and object were approaching, heading west.  I am a highly educated individual with a Masters degree, married with 2 daughters.",

We observed the object appear for five seconds stationary.   The object then dropped like a rock below the tree line in seconds.  Then ten seconds later it visibly moved back up above the tree line to about 30 degrees high and remained stationary.   Seconds later a second bright red oval appeared adjacent to the first at 30 degrees high.  The second red oval moved toward the first and only one red oval was visible for a few seconds before the oval red light faded out.

      "story": "Springfield, OR sightings of bright, multicolored lights near moon My wife and I witnessed a bright orange-yellow light floating at a helicopter speed in the night sky. The object was headed southward and contained no directional lights such as port or starboard signals. The object eventually fell away from eyesight. It appeared to be lower in the sky than usual aircraft. I saw another conventional commercial airliner off in the distance to use as a gauge for speed and elevation. After the disappearance of the bright orange-yellow light, we spotted a very bright \u201cstar\u201d eastward of the night\u2019s almost full moon. This bright star brought our attention to a pair of very twinkling lights that at first seemed to be very excited stars. We were able to spot these through a scope to see that these objects were flashing three bright colors; Red, yellow, and blue flashed in what seemed random order. To get a closer look, we headed up a nearby butte. When arriving at the top of the butte, we quickly noticed there were at least five of these combination lights. They appeared to be situated at all different heights in the sky and at different ranges. Focusing on the largest/closest object, we could see indeed that these lights had three main colors that revolved very brightly. The position of the lights did not appear to create a definitive form, but a V-like shape could almost be made out by tracing the lights together. We watched the lights for approximately 90 minutes, from 11:30pm to 1:00am.",

PD)) Witnessed a bright, disk shaped object seen flying from the sky to the ground at at close range. (Photos Taken) I was driving west from Rochester on Rochester Rd toward Lake Springfield.  When I reached the stop sign, there was a very bright light shining inside my car.  It was like a spot light from a police car.  I looked behind me and did not see a police car or any other vehicle.  I looked up and saw an orange light in the sky that wasn\u2019t moving. At a steady speed it came from a couple miles up to ground level in approximately 5 seconds.  It hovered over the ground about a 100ft away.  The craft looked like it was the length of a city bus.  I could see the grass moving as it rotated.  It stayed there for less than a minute. When it was at ground level the lights dimmed, and I could see the craft rotating horizontally like a wheel with blue colored lights blinking around it with white light coming off of it.  It turned brighter and the grass was moving faster. It lifted and turned about 80 degrees and took off about 3 times faster than it came down. As it took off, the craft was a very, very bright blue. The whole craft was shining brighter than a light bulb, more like magnesium burning. When it left, my radio started going nuts. It stopped working. My car wasn\u2019t running. There wasn\u2019t even a light on my tape adapter (for CD). This shows I didn\u2019t even have the battery working. After the craft left, my car would not start for 1 minute. A minute later it came back on by itself and the radio did. I didn\u2019t have to turn the key to start it. I was able to take pictures of the craft (with my cell phone) as it was coming in, when it landed, and when it took off. The whole event seemed to take place in less than five minutes. I am concerned that I felt fatigued when the \u2018spotlight\u2019 was on my car.  I also have very little recollection on how I was able to travel from the location the sighting took place in Rochester and ended up outside the Muni property by the lake.

      "story": "We saw a large football shaped object hovering above an apartment complex . I had picked my 5 yr.old son up at daycare.  Driving home we had to sit at a red light crossing the frwy at a bit of a downhill grade. My son sits low in the front seat.  He pointed up and slightly to the right and said, \"Mommy, what\u2019s that?\"   I lifted my sun visor and bent forward to see what he was pointing at.   We saw a large football shaped object hovering above an apartment complex.  We use to live in that complex years before so, I know how big the area is there.   This object hovered above the complex and was almost the same size as a football field including bleachers space!  It had a soft glow of white and no defined edges, no windows, no sound. I froze for a moment then shoved it in park, threw open my van door, and stood out on the step of the van.  I looked at the truck behind us, waved at them and pointed back up at it.  They too leaned down a bit to look under their visors, saw it, and they both raised their arms up to push up their visors at the same time their mouths wide open.   I looked back and it was still there and all of a sudden, I got scared and sat back in the van closing my door, looking up from inside with my son again the object sped quietly upward at an angle to the right, getting smaller.  Now the size of a baseball it stopped and changed course speeding upward in the opposite direction so fast and kept going till it disappeared.  Its flight path was in the shape of the letter V= (>) like this.  At that moment the light turned green we drove through and on the other side of the freeway was a field, parked along it was a man\u2019s truck.  He was in the field staring at a deer that was frozen scared staring back at him.  As he inched closer, I pulled over, jumped out and yelled, \"Did you see it!?\"  He said, \"See what?\"  I said the ufo, it was over there above that apartment complex\"  He said, \"In broad daylight, no?!\"   He looked at me like I was nuts and I ran back to my van and drove away...I remember one thing really struck me as odd.  Just before my son said, \"Mommy, what\u2019s that?\" !  I had be en repeating over and over in my mind-- Turn green, turn green, turn green.  When my son spoke to me it was as if he broke a trance I was in.  I had felt like I had been possessed to keep my attention on the red light in the intersection, the man and the deer too. It was as if he was made to stare only at the deer.  The deer was unusually frozen in its tracks.  HOW COULD HE NOT SEE IT!!! unless he was in some sort of trance too.  Why was my son unafected by this trance?  I don\u2019t know, maybe they didn\u2019t think he needed to be.  You know how you get a strange feeling someone is staring at you!   Well that\u2019s the feeling that frightened me into getting back in the van.  I felt like many eyes were watching me!  They saw me!  It has taking me years to be able to say this.  Aliens from another world looked at me and only at me for that moment in time that I stood on the step of my van.  I've read many stories over the years, but none described the massive ship I saw.  Please tell me if you heard of any ships as big as this one. I can\u2019t be alone on this one.

      "date": "2009-12-12T00:00:00",
      "story": "UFO orbs appear during intense MCV thunderstorm I'm senior in college at Missouri State University.  I was sleeping in because it was dead day, Friday May 8, which is always study day the Friday before finals.  I was woken up by tornado sirens and a really terrible thunderstorm at 9am.  The power was also out.  We get really bad thunderstorms but this one took the cake.  From www.weather.com/newscenter/stormwatch/:  \"MCV becomes - Inland Hurricane:  May 8, 2009 brought a derecho, a widespread windstorm associated with a bow echo thunderstorm complex, along a 600-mile-long, 60-mile wide swath across southeast KS, south MO, and south IL. Many of the damaging winds were not with the leading line of severe thunderstorm, but rather behind it and beneath a mid-level rotation center called an MCV - mesoscale convective vortex. Winds gusted to 106 mph. At least 220,000 customers lost power in MO and IL. The system spawned more than 30 tornadoes, at 20 of them in southwest MO. EF3 tornadoes hit Howell County MO and Garrard County KY.\"  This storm was crazy.  It was pounding my off campus apartment.  I could hear pieces of metal siding being ripped off the building.  It was the weirdest thing...the winds were blowing straight at the building, driving the rain around the edges of the sliding glass door and spraying my living room with water.  I was freaking out.  It was very intense, and I was frantically trying to figure out how to keep the water out.  The winds began to calm down a bit, and I was running around my apartment trying to find the memory card to my camera.  I'm a sort of an amateur meteorologist and love taking storm photos.  I'm a photography and graphic design major, and I have a Canon 40d with a number of lenses, including a solid zoom 100-400mm L.  However, I couldn't find my 16gb memory card and nearly ripped my apartment apart trying to find it.  I couldn't even find my backup 4gb card, which was odd, because its always in my bag.  After several minutes of frantic searching, I stopped for some reason, in my living room, turned to my right, and out the back sliding glass door window was the weirdest sight.  It was like an orb shaped thing, combined with a fireball, perhaps a few miles in the distance hovering beyond the middle school behind my apartment.  It was really weird because it seemed to be wiggly...like it had waves coming off of it that were vibrating.  It was bright white, and the edges seemed to be yellowish orange.  The first thing I thought was that something exploded in mid air, and this is where my memory is a little fuzzy because I'm reporting this many months later (which I'll explain soon).  I'm pretty sure that another one appeared on the sides of it, which made me think it was an aircraft.  Sometimes aircraft fly under thunderstorms to avoid the dangerous updrafts.  But the way the lights radiated was just too weird.  Then they each disappeared, one by one, quickly.  What ticked me ! off the most was that even though I had my camera around my neck, I couldn't take a photo!  Gaaahh!  Ridiculous.  So I grab my iPhone, text my fiance and roommate to tell them what happened, and then looked up Springfield's airport website to find arrival / departure times.  There were no planes landing near the time that I saw the lights, and Springfield, being a small town of 150k, it doesn't get many large aircraft landing during the day.  Also the lights didn't seem to be moving in any direction, and if they were coming head on, that wouldn't make any sense either, because the airport is on the NE fringe of town and I was right in the middle of town, and even though its a small town, its spread out over 88 square miles because they don't know how to build up in these small towns.  The other explanation would be ball lightning, which hasn't been scientifically proven to exist, but has been observed by many people in the past.  So here is some background info on why I'm posting this so far after the fact: tonight I was watching UFO Hunters on the History channel and they showed these orbs on there that have been occuring in the Ozarks around Springfield this year and some of the video and artist's renditions looked a lot like what I saw and it freaked me out.  I didn't get the same feeling of dread when I saw it that other people have reported, but I did feel like I was frozen and couldn't move.  It was pretty wild.  They also reported about a light on the north side of town, and I also believe I have seen this light before when driving back in forth to Bolivar, MO to see my friends at SBU.  It just seems too bright and out of place for that area of the sky and I only notice it sometimes.  I feel like I have a fairly solid grasp of astronomy, having taken a college course where we had to learn about heavenly objects and went out to Baker Observatory (which ironically is near Marshfield, where on UF! O hunters a highway patrolman reported an orb following him) on several occasions to observe the night sky.  My dad was also an amateur astronomer when I was younger and we would go outside and look at the stars frequently.  I'm also not a crazy UFO person, but a fairly rational college student.  However, I feel like I have some sort of odd connection with UFOs.  When I was in elementary school I would have horrible horrible night terrors of being abducted by aliens and when I was in 10th grade, I had another encounter I'd like to share.  Feel free to remove this for the reporting post but I want to submit it along with this for completeness:  My best friend and I were driving home late on a Thursday night from the movies near midnight, which was my curfew in 10th grade.  My best friend is very smart, an Eagle Scout and a member of the Stretch program at school for highly intelligent students.  We were both in advanced placement programs for math and literature.   Since it was so long ago (2001-2002?) I can't remember the date at all. We were waiting at a red light at 7hwy and 40hwy in Blue Springs, MO, a suburb of Kansas City.  We saw three orb lights, in a triangle formation, float over the HyVee grocery store, turn while crossing 40hwy, and then float over the WalMart.  Then they suddenly zoomed off at incredibly high speed in the direction of my house.  The way they moved made us feel like they were attached.  Both of us saw the lights and were a bit freaked out.  That's when things started to get really crazy.  As we continued down 40 hwy and the other two roads [road names REDACTED, since it's near my parent! s house], nearly every single street light we passed by suddenly went out.  It was making us very scared, especially since we were in a convertible.  My friend pulled into the circle drive I lived on, and dropped me off at the bottom of the driveway.  Before getting out, I noted that it was 11:55pm, before curfew, since I was worried about getting back in time.  When I got inside, my dad half-joked that I was late (it wasn't a serious violation) and I said \"What are you talking about?\"  I looked at the time and it was 12:05am.  I was so confused.  How did it take me 10 minutes to walk inside?  I went straight inside.  So I talked to my friend the next day and he told me something pretty interesting (and scary).  Apparently when he was at the stop sign to leave my circle drive, he saw a bright flash in his rear view mirror.  He turns around, and he said he couldn't see me anywhere.  He then drove away quickly, which at the time ticked me off that he just left me like that.  ! That about freaked the hell out of me.  I've only told these stories to a few people, but figured that I might as well come forward now.  I bet there are a lot of normal people out there, like me, who would never google UFO reports and actually type up something like this and send it in because they would think that they must be crazy.  But I am starting to think that there is something to this whole UFO thing and that if I didn't share this, then I wouldn't be helping anyone figure out what's going on.  I also got my accurate times for the first report from the messaging app on my iPhone.  I sent the text to my fiance right after the event (and I also sent her one right after I awoke to tornado sirens, she lived in the Kansas City area at the time) and it was logged in the app.  Honestly, I have no idea what's going on, but its starting to freak me out a bit that stuff that I've seen is showing up on TV in the town I live in when I thought that there must be a rational explanation.  I just can't get my mind aroun! d the idea that there are aliens flying around the earth.  It just doesn't seem possible.  I just thought that was something to be scared of as a child, like monsters or the boogie man.  If it's proven that aliens are real, then it's going to be really hard for me to deal with that.  It just doesn't make sense!  Why would they even appear like this or take people?  What is the motive?  Are they bored?  Why not just come down and show themselves?  Are they just having fun with us?  It is so weird that other people have seen something similar to what I saw.  It is even more weird that there have been enough people seeing things that a UFO tv show came to this town to interview people.  I wish they would go away because now I'm fearful of their presence and my possible connection to them.  Also my mom told me a couple years ago that my grandpa used to see ufos, strage lights, and would awake in the middle of the night, at the window, sleepwalking, talking to them outside the w! indow.  My mom saw a ufo with them when she was younger, hover! ing over a car in a parking lot late one night.  That was probably sometime in the late 70s early 80s.  Is there something about my family that attracts them?  Or is it a coincidence?  Sorry for the rambling, I've got a huge project due in the morning and it's getting late!  Time to get back to work...feel free to edit this to make it more cohesive for online consumption.  Thanks for your time.",

I pointed it out to my family, and told them, let's go, get me home, I need to get my camera! It only took us less than 3 min to get home. My daughter ran in and got the camera as I stood with my younger daughter out front the house watching these things moving along the same path rather slowly, there was low lying small puffy clouds, we could watch them move.  At one point after the flash of the camera went off all of a sudden there was one that got really bright, then faded completely,they were heading south directly over head, down what is considered the I-5corridor.  Higher than I see planes travel lower than the stars yet the stars where just starting to appear. As we watched  these numerous lights flowing through the sky, none however seemed to be in the part of the sky with out the clouds.  I was able to capture a few with my digital camera. When zoomed in on two different frames I shot, there was two object that had numerous lights around what looked like the mid section, the lights appear to look greenish in color with a red light directly center on the top, where the top light was in relation the the green lights gave it the appearance of the classic saucer shape,  the larger of the two object I also was able to pick up lights in the center directly below the center lights, in this same frame I also captured another object flying below the larger object.  It appeared to be smaller and more triangular with the point heading south and what looked like bright lights coming off the back like after burners.  There was no sound that we could hear, I have never seen this many planes in the same space of sky flying in the same direction a! s these where. I also took a shot toward the moon where the sky was clear without clouds, when I zoomed in on the photo frame I brought up a number of objects some looking like orbs, yet one was brighter and as I zoomed in further it was like none of the others I captured, it had roundness to it at first due to the glow of its lights that went all the way around, yet as I zoomed in further it had a number of points 3 to the back and a square outline to the sides that came around to the front with a few more points 2 to the front and a long point in the middle of those 2 points, the direction it was moving, seemed to be northwest from the southeast sky, the lights on it appeared to be white and the middle underside was dark. I thought to get my camera to try and capture what was passing over head after seeing some photos a friend had captured, here in the area over the past few months.",

      "story": "Two lights flying in loose formation disappear in sudden vertical climb. At approximately 2125 Pacific Daylight Time, September 8, 2009, I was leaving a friends home walking to my truck.  I noticed two bright, -2 to -4 star-like objects in the western sky.  At first I thought they were stars but their obvious motion eliminated that possibility.  The second thought was that they were aircraft, possibly jetliners at high altitude.  But their apparent path, traveling from west to east eliminated that possibility as well.  (Commercial aircraft at altitude DO NOT normally travel from east to west over this area.  The normal path for commercial air traffic is north-south, generally traveling between the major west coast airports of Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.  Aircraft heading east from this area do so at lower altitudes taking off from the local airport the turning east.) \tViewing conditions were clear, with no clouds.  The two lights were the brightest objects in the sky while they were visible. I called my friend over to view these objects and she was startled at their apparent motion across the night sky.  We thought they might be satellites but that was dispelled when the lead light changed course from a west-east direction to a north by northeast course. Having had years of observing satellites, (I\u2019m old enough to have seen Sputnik\u2019s first crossing of the Pacific Northwest sky) the speed of these two lights was much faster than a normal satellite.  Their apparent altitude was within the atmosphere but very high up.  I say this because there was no \u201ctwinkle\u201d as with the other star objects visible at the time of this sighting. These two lights were traveling at identical speeds.  The lead light was ahead and north of the second as viewed from the ground.  The first light passed in front of the Big Dipper.  The second light, from our viewing location passed below the Big Dipper and farther south than the first.  I would guess the observed separation to be between 40 to 60 degrees north to south and about the same west to east. Shortly after the first light changed course it went vertical.  In less than ten seconds it disappeared from sight.  From our viewing point (I\u2019ll send the actual Latitude and Longitude if you like) the first light disappeared just a little west of the constellation Cassiopeia. Right after the first one disappeared the second light changed course the same as the first.  Then it too went vertical and in less than ten seconds disappeared.  The second light followed the same vertical course as the first. There was no sound accompanying these two lights.  We listened long and hard to try to hear the faintest of sounds but heard none. These lights might have been military aircraft but the vertical acceleration argues against that idea.  Also, for two military jets to go vertical at such velocity would have required a considerable burn from their engines.  No engine noise or glow was seen. Once the two lights went vertical they faded from sight. Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD))",

      "story": "white glowing craft travels overhead and changes direction I was just starting to walk with my dog for the evening.  I looked up to scan the night sky and saw an object coming from the western sky that did not appear to be an airplane.   It was coming directly from the west and I was hoping it would be a satellite reflecting the light from the sun that had set an hour earlier.  I did not see flashing lights, or colored lights; just a steady glow.  As the object drew closer, it appeared it was about as high as some of the jet airliners that often pass overhead to other cities.   I was just outside of my house, so I ran back in to get binoculars (7x35) to see the object better.  It appeared to be traveling as fast as military jets at high altitude, but it did not look like a plane.  Using the binoculars, I was then able to tell that the quality of light was much brighter than reflected sunlight and that the object appeared to be creating the light.  It was a round shape; glowing a very bright white with a slight hint of blue at the edges.  Again, I could not see any standard aircraft lighting.  Based on the altitude of normal aircraft, the diameter of the object appeared to be as big as the length of an airliner.   It was now about overhead, and I was thinking it could still be a satellite, when it then began changing its eastern course and then began heading in a northeastern direction.  I could not see jet thrusters or wings on the craft. I continued to watch it as it disappeared.    If it was satellite, it should have lost intensity as it went further from the horizon, and it would not have changed directions.",

At that point I observed a cigar shaped object that at first looked like the fusilage of an airliner with a blue metallic tint, but no windows evident.   Further obervation failed to disclose wings or rotors, nor did I hear any sound whatsoever coming from this object.  It moved slowly to the southeast right into a cloud bank.   I continued to watch but it never reappeared.  Helicopters, airplanes and jets of all sorts frequent this area as this location is near several airports.  I can always hear the rotors or engines droning but this object made no sound.   It took me several days to completely comprehend what I had observed.

They appeared to be moving although I didn't observe the craft long enough to give a description as to how they moved.  From my angle of view this object appeared to be cigar in shape. The craft was traveling east to west in a straight line at an altitude of around 500 feet.  The speed of this craft was incredible.  The only way I can describe it is supersonic. It went from horizon to horizon in 5 to 10 seconds.  Trailing behind this craft was a strange vapor trail. It glowed with a sickly white-green color. It reminded me of the Aurora Borealis, the way it seemed to shimmer and move. The intensity of the vapor was very asymmetrical, the most concentration was closest to! the back of the craft and then quickly faded away. The most unnerving aspect about this whole sighting for me was that this craft made no noise what so ever. I live near Westover Air Force Base, and you can hear the planes WAY before you see them.",

The sound coming from it was very similar to the sound a hair dryer would make but it was higher pitched. I know it wasn't a plane or a helicopter because it was too far from a hospital or airport to be so low.",

Sitting on my steps I was looking straight at the skyline. It was about 10pm, and dark.   All of a sudden I saw a green light flash across the sky. It came out of nowhere. If you stuck your arms out to measure the distance it travelled, it would have been about a foot between my arms as a measure.  It seemed to appear at the same height as the stars, and shot across the sky then disappeared.  Was this a shooting star or a comet?  I don't know. Are comets or shooting stars a green blob circle of light that shoots across the sky?  I've seen shooting stars and a meteor shower before. Neither were green.  And though I could not tell how high up this was.  The intensity of the green light makes me think that it was not as high as the stars, possibly in the higher parts of our atmosphere. That's my gut feeling.   Did I see a alien ship? I t's a possibility.",

      "story": "Fireball seen over Springfield, Oregon At roughly 1:30 a.m., May 8, 2012, my friend and I had just returned to the Eugene area from Portland when we saw a fireball falling from the sky.  I was driving, and I saw the flash above and ahead and slightly to the left of our vehicle.   We were driving due west at that time on Centennial Blvd. in Springfield, OR, which means that the object was traveling from south to north.  The sighting lasted only a few seconds and ended when the object disappeared from view to the north (the treeline blocked our line of sight).   My friend and I afterwards agreed that the object was unlike anything either of us has ever seen before. I'm familiar with Chinese lanterns, having seen plenty of them in the U.S. and Asia, and there's no way this was a Chinese lantern.   I've also seen plenty of shooting stars, and this object was &quot;falling&quot; much too slowly to have been a meteor. I use the term &quot;falling&quot; advisedly, because it did not seem to be in a natural free! fall. It was going down quickly, but it also seemed like it was floating.  The strange thing about this sighting is that I would describe the object I saw as orange, or orange-yellow, whereas my friend saw something green.  I don't know what to make of that discrepancy.  Neither of us had been drinking or using drugs.",

      "story": "On July 4 at approx eleven pm I was standing in my back yard when from my right an orange orb or light appeared traveling at a slow speed.  It was relatively high in the sky but appeared to be very close to my position and yet I couldn't make out an object associated with the light it was as if it were on fire but there was no flickering nor smoke nor was anything falling from the object.  I was completely floored by the sight of it mostly because this was a relatively large size light, about half the size of my thumb at arms length and larger vertically than horizontally and yet no sound could be heard, no flickering of light such as all aircraft I have seen in the sky display and so I couldn't figure out what it was.  For a moment I entertained the possiblility it was a meteorite and hoped that if it were one it would drop some material that I could retreive.  As I watched this light proceed in a north to south direction I noticed , again to my right, a q! uick movement and looking that direction I saw another light that seemed to swoop (for want of better way to explain how it appeared to fly) into view coming from a north to south direction and immediately to a east west direction and then again to the same apparent direction as the other light.  It assumed the same height and speed of the other light and this light was also orange and appeared to be on fire but with no flickering.  This object, although seeming to be the same apparent size of the first object was more of a tear-drop shape than the other one and it had a rather spiky appearance to its light.  These objects were entirely composed of light from my view of them I could not make out any features. I was thinking someone else must be able to see these objects, people were out shooting off fireworks and so the chance that someone was looking up at the sky were pretty good --I felt very excited seeing these objects because I've never seen anything like them before and I felt I was seeing a rare sight but by no means did I think I was the only one who could see them.  The big dipper was in the north/northwest sky and was setting..these objects were approximately half-way up the dipper or about half way up the sky in my estimation, about the same height a small aircraft would fly and lower than a jet.  I have seen loads of aircraft in the skies from my backyard and none have ever had lights as large as these two were, not even a helicopter close in the sky would have that type of light. The two lights, the second light having moved closer to the first light, continued to move steadily and at the same height in a southerly direction and I watched them looking from one to the other when I noticed the first light I had seen appeared to turn to the west and began to get smaller as if fading out or even burning out?   I watched it completely disappear in less than a minute.  I looked back to the other light and it too turned and began to fade from sight appearing to be going west directly away from me straight ahead of my orientation.  I did not take my eyes off of this one and watched until it appeared to become a tiny white circle such as a star would appear and seemingly to be very far away.  And then it too disappeared.  I watched for another hour on this clear night with a full moon behind me for anything even vaguely resembling what I saw but did not see any further objects. I have never seen anything like this before, could these have been some kind of firework?",

      "story": "FOr the past month on a daily basis I have seen what appear to be stars coasting across the night sky. The height or level of flight appears to be well over what commercial and fighter planes fly.  My guess is whenever I see them they are well into 100,000 plus feet into what I would consider outer space, the level of the stars!   My first sighting was in P.R. while on vacation ( spinning wheel like fire approached where I was staying and then made a fast 90 degree turn and thrusted away extremely fast) that was Nov. 2011.  Between late June 2012 through 7-24-12 I have seen many things in the sky on a nightly basis which I firmly believe with witnesses to be UFO's meaning objects that I cannot identify.  I have over 8 other eywitnesses who have seen them with me and without me being present. What I seen between 7-4 through 7-24-12 are starlike objects, silent while traveling and at times pulse activity with the object. On 7-24-12 after leaving a store I pointed! out to my friend in Springfield, Ma North of an area near a town called Ludlow, Ma, a long shaped cigar shape with lights all across.  The object floated silently, dropped and then disappeared.   That same evening which was 12:30 a.m. I drove home quickly in an attempt to find the object but it was gone. Then I decided to star gaze as I been doing for the past month.  I invited another friend over my home who had a close encounter on 7-4-12 of orange spheres with over 15 people as witneses.  He now is more interested in the night sky since his experience.   He seen a bright starlike light with me that hovered for over two hours changing colors from white, green, blue, orange. It then switched positions to another location in the sky.  During my observing the bright starlike object changing color I seen high in the sky a light coasting across the night sky extremely high with pulsing light.  A second one appeared doing the samething heading east as the other was heading west.  This h! as been a regular occurance EVERY NIGHT there is a clear sky.   My wife seen this and dismissed it as a hig plane. However after her 4th sighting she says she thinks its something different.",

I sat on my porch, looking at the stars, when I noticed a blinking star. I looked closely and it was blinking red and blue, very bright in color. Then I noticed that it was moving all over the sky, right, left, up, down. I ran inside to get a blanket, and ran back out and it was still there. It would get closer at times, and it would occasionally stop and hover. I could see that it could be a spear shape, with the light in the center and coming from the center there were long lines, as if connecting on the outer rim. I wasn't sure what I was seeing, and kept watching it for an hour, going around the sky, getting closer then further away. When I did get to see it, it looked like some sort of craft, honestly. I don't know how to describe it. It was dark and I could only see so much. I did see a plane fly by and pass by it. I waited for somet! hing to happen, but it continued for an hour before I decided I was freezing and had to go inside. All I know is that I have never seen anything like it before.",

She pointed out a cluster of lights in the sky and asked my if I could see them and if they were stars.  I looked to where she was pointing and at a glance what I saw did appear to be stars of constellations.  As I continued to look at these lights I noticed that they appeared to be moving.  The lights were not maintaining the pattern they were in when I first looked at them.  They also seemed to be much closer in distance than what most stars look like.  I looked around in different directions and noticed that there were not any actual stars out yet.  These lights were the only lights in the sky. We arrived at our destination and got out of the car for a better view.  The lights appeared to be moving in a north/northwest direction.  They looked as if they were flashing red and white.  At first, when we first saw the lights, there were about 20 to 30 lights.  When we were out of the car there were only about 10 to 15.  As we were watching the remaining lights, the lights were moving and would just disappear.  Two more individual lights appeared in my peripheral vision, coming out from the south over some trees.  These lights did not make it as far across my view point before vanishing. All of the lights observed while outside of the car seemed to be as close in distance as a local airplane might be if flying through the sky.  Definitely within the Earth's atmosphere.  Thought these might be related to the meteor shower that was being reported to be taking place, but there were no streaks or tails and they were not moving very fast.  Tried to get a photo taken with camera phone.  Zoomed in to 4x zoom.  The image at that zoom level was a fuzzy red dot and that dot was about a quarter of an inch wide.

      "story": "Springfield,MO. A white light the size of a star moving at a high rate of speed!! I am 51yrs. old. I was facing south and the the object I saw was a white round light. It looked like a small star only it moved across the sky in a straight and seemed like a deliberate direction from the west in a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed. I have seen passenger aircraft and military jets at high altitude like the size of a star, day and night time with the blinking light or lights and they appear to crawl across the sky, when in fact they are also flying at high rates of speed. This object around 10:00PM-05/16/2012 did not blink it was a solid round white light and moved so fast. This is the second time in my life I have ever seen anyting move this fast in the sky. It looked and moved just like what I saw in the in the very early 70's when I was around the age of 11yrs old. Facing north, that object at first sight looked like a helicopter spotlight low in the sky then in a blink was the size of a tiny star moving from west to the ESE direc! tion at a very high rate of speed. At school the next day I told a friend Wallace what I saw I gave no detail because he responded \"Hey I saw the same\" before I could finish. I honestly did not believe him until that evening after school in the front yard of my house he pointed to the sky exactly where I saw the object, he moved his arm in a fast motion while pointing, like he was following the object in the same exact direction!  This on the night of 05/16/2012 was not an airplane, it was not my imagination nor was it a helicopter spotlight,shooting star ETC! I may be a skeptic to some degree but, I know what I saw was not normal!! I was in the navy starting in 1979 at Cecil Field Naval Airbase in Cecil Field FL. I never saw anything move as fast as what I saw on the night of may 16th 2012 and on that night in the 70's. My wife and I now live in the same house I grew up in. \"To sum this up\" On that night in the very early 70's I was facing the north I saw what looked like ! a helicopter spotlight and in a blink it was a white light the! size of a smaller star round in shape moving from west to a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed!! Present day on the night of 05/16/2012 around 10:00PM I was facing South and saw a white light in the West part of the sky the size of a small star, moving in a ESE direction at a very high rate of speed and was moving in a deliberate direction, not falling. It did not change direction and was visible to me only for about 15 seconds in the area visible to me because of trees.If this had been a normal aircraft like a military jet or even a passenger plane it would have taken at the very least a minute to pass the same exact distance.I take our trash out every night and look to the sky because I love the night sky and checking out the moon. I see aircraft all the time and know there is a major difference in what I see every night and what I saw the night of 05/16/2012 around 10:00PM and that night in the 70's.  Both events I saw in the sky ( 70's and present day) I saw from the sa! me house. I know of no aircraft that can move that fast when looking from the ground up to an altitude as high as these objects were! I know there are very fast jets...BUT NOT WHAT I SAW!!",

It looked identical, shaped like a lightbulb, and was towards the south-southeast over the cemetary. It seemed to float somewhat stationary above the cemetary for about a minute then slowly traveled in an eratic floating type manner directly above us and then towards the North.

I ran through the house yelling for my husband to follow me to the front yard to watch it pass, saying I think a helicopter is on fire.  We both stood in the front yard unable to identify what we were seeing.  We watch the sky a lot so we know most of the aircraft that pass this way.  This craft proceeded to silently travel south and turned east just past the Battlefield Mall.",

I stepped out onto my small porch to look at it.  The object was about 2 feet in diameter.  Where the \"saucers\" were put together, a greenish light shone forth.   A beam of greenish light shot out and I felt myself immobilized.  At the same time, I felt a message (feeling, not words)of kindness and goodness transmitted, and I felt a love for the mind(s) that sent the message and smiled slightly.   The beam scanned me from head to toe.  No memory of anything else....I guess I just went back inside.   Strange thing is, I had no memory of the event for several years....I don't know how long this amnesia lasted.  All I know is that at! some point the memory returned to me and that I still have it and remember it with very positive feelings.

So I quickly called my mom and step-dad out to witness it too.  It was a small blue orb-like light that appeared, streaked across the sky, then disappeared...and then appeared again.  It seemed to be flying around in circles, but in a sporadic flight pattern accelerating and decelerating and changing directions much faster than any modern military aircraft could do. It would appear, fly a looping, zig-zag pattern for a few seconds then disappear, only to appear again a few moments later.  It wasn't a spotlight because it was a little orb and I would have been able to see the beam of light.  There were possibly more than one because at one point my Mom saw two fly right by each other then split off in different directions, and I saw one with a red flashing light on it and then one without so there could have been multiple orbs.  It wasn't an airplane either because there wasn't a flashing white light and they flew very differently than a jet.  It seemed like there was only one, then more started popping up and then just like that they were gone.  Also, before they completely disappeared they seemed to be flying around at altitude then diving at the ground at steep angles and very rapid speeds, almost like a dive-bomber would.  I captured it on my iPhone but we were too far away and the camera is too poor I don't think you can see anything.  I first saw it around 2345 and they disappeared around 0000. It could have been going on before that but that is when I noticed it.",

I live in springfield, but this thing is far away so it looks like its in the direction of Palmer or Munson.   The first time I saw it it was coming towards Springfield from the Palmer direction.  At first I thought it was a plane but it was going really fast and the lights of the craft were very bright with one green flashing light, not like a blinking light, it was flashing quickly and the angle of the craft was upwards not like the way a plane would ascend.  I thought wow that must be some new spy plane or something that the Gov designed, but it was really fast.  There was a plane flying on the eastern side of my window and it was so much slower than this plane. I saw it for about six seconds ascending and then it disapeared out of my view.   The second time was a few days ago. It was the same bright white lights with a flashing green light, but this time it was just hovering.  I w! atched it thinking maybe it was a blimp or a star and my eyes were playing tricks so I kept blinking to make sure I was seeing correctly.  The craft moved slightly left then right then went into a 90 degree angle but did not ascend.  Then a little white light broke off from the craft and moved around a little in a circular motion then went back to the craft.  Eventually I just stopped watching because I don't have a camera right now and I started to just think it was a tower or a star or a blimp.  I figured if I saw it the next day it was something that had always been there. But the next day it wasn't there.  Then tonight The thing was to the right of my window flashing brightly still towards Palmer and hovering.  It moved to the left and up and stayed there for a while. My husband yelled at me to go to bed and that I'm crazy but now its gone so I don't know where it went. Once I get a camera for christmas and if the thing comes back I am going to find out what exactly tha! t thing is because it is nothing like I have ever seen.  I lik! e to wat ch stars and have seen different types of planes because we live near a military airbase, but this thing is in the opposite direction of the base and it definitley wasn't a conventional plane or craft.  I don't even think a blimp could maneuver like this thing did but I don't know. All I know is I hope other people have seen this thing because it is weird.",

Municipal Airport, WPAFB, and Dayton International Airport for the majority of our lives, I think it's safe to say we know what aircraft look like, even at night. I just happened to look up into the sky and this thing immediately caught my eye as being unusual. It was cruising at a relatively low altitude and speed compared to other air traffic in the vicinity.  It displayed NONE of the standard FAA required lighting and made NO sound.  Surprising for how low and close it was.  Also, it appeared to have no distinguishable outline.  Basically it just looked like a ball of white light.  I said to the ladyfriend, \"That's kind of strange.\"  We both were standing there watching this thing when it suddenly faded into an orangish color then COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.  There were absolutely no clouds in the sky and this thing was very far from the horizon where it could've appeared to have vanished.  For the rest of the walk home we were comparing the air traffic to what we just saw.  It was apparent we saw something unusual.  No red/green or blinking lights on wing tips which were clearly visible on aircraft at a much higher altitude.  Definitely NOT a satellite because the altitude was WAY too low.",

The structure of the UFO was comparable to a upside down light-bulb. At the bottom of the UFO there was a single hole that i could see inside the craft through, the hole was also emitting red-orange light with a ball of red-orange light that was positioned at the center of the hole in the UFO without struts or bars attached to it.  I heard the trees moving and I looked to my left near the top of the trees at my home and saw the UFO hovering behind the tree. The UFO then slowly moved at a speed around 10 mph to the end of my street. I yelled to my girlfriend who was beside me to look and I pointed at the UFO. The UFO immediately started hovering higher and moving away from my location at around 30 MPH and gradually built up speed and rose higher until it was no longer visible. \tAfter seeing the UFO, two of my friends and I were watching the skies for the UFO in case it returned. We watched for about an hour and noticed six other red orbs in different locations in the sky, Three of the six orbs were flying individually. The other three orbs were in a triangular formation and flying in the same direction as if part of the same aircraft.",

BUT.....  We were intrigued by this 'other star' as it was so bright and went to the edge of the mountain (we were on the top of a gravel pit yard)... and as we were watching this 'star' it rose up directly upward quite a ways and we couldn't believe what we saw ... and then after only seconds watching it,,, i said,,, I think it is 'coming' toward us and we all started running back to the door way of the apartment (while my son got his camera out of his truck he used every day for work)... when we were at the door way we looked up and the object was colorfully lit up with the most beautiful lights I had ever seen in my life... they were gorgeous.... not so many lights were in the front of the object that appeared around 75 feet long ~ was an oblong shape.... my son's camera would NOT WORK and we were very disappointed... my daughter in law wanted to run out under the object that was just above the tree tops (around 70 feet) and I would not let her go because I had seen the movie: FIRE IN THE SKY ~ and did not trust whatever this object was about... we blinked and then it was GONE ~ that quickly... didn't even see it take off  It just vanished faster than we could even turn our heads.... we were all in total shock because NO SOUND CAME FROM THE CRAFT.....

They caught my attention due to the fact they seemed engaged in some flight patterns that didn't make sense, they were heading directly toward one another but never collided.   Then I noticed the other crafts that were identical at other points in the sky, all very close together and not displaying any typical aircraft lighting.  They seemed to be hovering more than anything but I could see something like fire coming from the end of them.   As I drove on all but 3 of them vanished and the 3 that were left formed almost a triangle formation of sorts in the sky, eventually 2 vanished and left 1 which appeared to be closer now and the \"fire\" I saw coming from the end of it now looked pink in color. I have never seen anything like this in our skies before.  Also I would like to note that about 30 minutes later as I was sitting at an intersection the sky in front of me was daylight as it should be and when I looked to my right the sky there was in pitch darkness, I was very confused as to how it can be daylight yet dark so close together, I snapped photos of the daylight/darkness part with my cellular phone to show other people to see if anyone could explain it.   All of this is very strange and I dont know what to make of it, I came here after finding it on google hoping perhaps someone else had seen these things and reported them also.

On the horizontal part were four equally-spaced, brilliant red lights, and on the vertical part were four equally spaced blue lights.  The object seemed to be as large as a jet airliner at about 1000 ft altitude above ground, and then proceeded to fly to the west.  It followed a curving path towards the north as it flew (very quickly) away, and was out of sight in 30 seconds.  It made absolutely NO sound.

She asked, \"What is that thing?\"  I have worked in aviation as an aircraft fueler, and I know that any lights that are not FAA approved are probably not going to appear on an aircraft.

The first thing that came to mind was \u201cThis isn\u2019t completely normal. I should take a picture\u201d.  So I rolled down the window and held my phone out the window to take the picture.  I wanted to try to get another picture but when I looked again the object was gone. The 2 pictures included are the same photo, one of the is cropped and zoomed.

      "story": "Object seen the night Mars was closest to Earth August 27, 2003. August 27, 2003.  It was the night that Mars was closest to the earth and I was staying at my son & daughter-in-laws apartment on top of a mountain that was a rock quarry off of Camp Creek Rd., Springfield, OR. My son asked his wife this night if she had seen \u2018Mars\u2019 and she said no, so all 3 of us went out of the apartment (it was attached on the end of a very large metal shop building) and as we walked outside there was a Very Bright Light, my son said \u201csee there it is\u201d and I said to him,,, \u201cNo, that is not Mars, it is more to the Southeast, but I don\u2019t know what that \u2018bright light is\u2019\u2026.. As we got to the end of the building there to the South was \u2018Mars\u2019, and we looked at it and then at the \u2018Bright Light\u2019, that looked like a Star,,,, we all walked out to the clearing on the top of the mountain and was looking at this \u2018Light\u2019, and all of a sudden it went Vertically UP\u2026 not far from what one would estimate in \u2018height\u2019 but then I got the distinct feeling it was coming right at us\u2026..\u201dI yelled to my Son and his wife \u201cget back to the apartment quick\u201d, my son said as he was running he was going to get his camera and being 6\u20193\u201d 195 of solid muscle ran quickly to his pick-up and grabbed his camera and ran to the apartment door where his wife and I were (there was a little cover built over the doorway),,,  My son looked up and tried to use his camera (which he used every day for work but it would not work) as we all looked up \u201cThere was this Beautiful Object just above the tree tops that had the most Amazing Lights I had ever seen in my life\u201d, I kept saying\u2026. \u201cWow,,,, look at those lights, they are beautiful\u201d, and my daughter-in-law wanted to run out under the object and I held her back and told her \u201cNO\u2026. You can\u2019t go out there, haven\u2019t you seen the movie \u201cFire in the Sky\u201d????  She said NO, and even though I didn\u2019t know what we were looking at\u2026. In my subconscious mind I knew it was not something to investigate. The object only stayed above us for a minute maybe two\u2026 but as fast as we \u2018blinked our eyes it was gone\u2019!!!  We ran to the other end of the building and could find no trace of where it had gone\u2026.. I told my daughter about it the next day and she told me she was listening to CNN that morning and a couple reported seeing a \u2018bright object that looked like a star in the sky that same night we did and it came towards them as well\u2019\u2026. I tried to contact CNN to get information about the couple but never got a response. This really did happen and after we went inside, my son stated that \u201cwe just saw a UFO\u201d, it was like we were mesmerized when it was above us, but we lost no \u2018time\u2019 in this encounter and none of us have had nightmares or dreams that have frightened us so I do not believe there was any encounter with whoever was in the object. This actually did happen to all 3 of us and I am grateful no \u2018encounter\u2019 happened to us or that we were subjected to any abduction from \u2018them\u2019!",

      "story": "Star ship over Springfield housing lights of white, red, blue, amber and teal. I am a US Army soldier, with overseas experience.  I have not seen everything, but I have seen a lot.  Over the last few weeks, tonight included, I've seen more. Leaving my girlfriends house here in Springfield, MA, about two weeks ago, I noticed something odd in the sky traveling south in my direction.  It was low, fast, big and soundless.   Looking straight toward it, it was one bright white light.  As it passed it seemed \"domed disk\" in shape.  The white light was in the front and along the edge between, seemingly, the disk and the dome were four different color blinking lights.  Red, blue, amber and teal.  It soon banked south west then quickly south again and then south east.   I was trying to follow it there and lost sight.  That's when it doubled back and went almost directly over head.  I'm not telling you I know what I saw, but I will tell you I know what I didn't see.   I could draw this thing if you asked me to.  Underneath were four circles.  The two in the front were a little smaller than the two in the back.  In each of the circles were the same four colored lights.  The body of the ship connected to them in a curved pattern almos! t like webbed feet and was dark.  The nose flew lower than the tail as well.   It ended up quickly changing direction west toward the CT river.  There it paused for a while.   By this time I made it home and ran in to get a rifle scope for a clearer view.  It left in my attempt.  The night was clear and I tilt my head back in aggravation.  That's when I noticed, spread out, about 9 or 10 very large bright stars.   Using the scope I began to look at them.  They were all blinking.  Tonight, at the same time as the first sighting, 11:30 pm, I left her house again.  I noticed a massive bright light hovering a distance away where I saw the last one advance from.   After a few seconds it began to slowly trek in the same pattern as the first time.  I grabbed my phone for a pic, but the battery was to low.   I put it on the charger and began to follow it again.  It in the blink of an eye sped up.  It banked in the same direction as the last time but never doubled back.   Just as my disappointment  set in from not getting a pic, a second one(have photo) came toward ! me from the left.  I quickly grabbed my phone and got off one shot before it sped away.   The night is very cloudy(3-25-14) as snow is expected to fall.  This photo is NOT the moon.  You can see barely how low it it is and the image was bigger and closer than my cheap camera phone makes it appear.  None the less, you can see it.   I text a buddy in CT as they were headed in his direction.  He is fairly well learned on popular aircraft so he got in his car to see if he could spot them.   Skeptical at first, his attitude quickly changed.  I cannot word for word give you his testament, but we would gladly meet with you to discuss what we saw.   He got a very good view that left him slightly spooked.   Know this, I have never had a drop of alcohol in my life, nor do I smoke, use drugs, or am I on medication.  What I saw, I saw.  I have never been a skeptic, but at the same time, never thought I'd get to see it for myself.  After the second time, I don't have a doubt in my mind.",

Next to Knights action park in Springfield IL.  I was watching the new \"Terminator\" movie, and behind the screen, nowhere close to being on the screen,  I saw a light show up out of no where.  Now, I at first thought it could be a shooting star or  satellite dish (sic.  Satellite), but before it disappeared behind the screen out of view, it curved dramatically.  At least 90 degrees and as far as I know.  Shooting stars and  satellite dishes (sic. Satellite)  cannot make a turn that big.   I was sitting in the front row next to my mom and dad, though neither of them saw it.  But there were a lot more people there watching the movie, so I'm sure someone saw it too.  Another thing was that it showed up out of no where then because the screen was in the way I don't know where it went.  It was a glowing white in color.   I'm 16 years old and I have seen shooting stars before.  This was nothing like one.   And in my opinion I believe there is life else where.  I'd just never thought I would be reporting something like this.   I don't know how to any more explain what I saw.   I am not positive the exact time but it was around 12:30 to 1 am.",

My back door faces south. Its been so cloudy lately so i noticed the stars right away. I noted arcturus and then scanned to the west and noted jupiter.  I need to say that i am overwhelmed again suddenly as i write this  tears flood and i feel overwhelmed and i promise this is not a joke.  as soon as i noted jupiter i look just to the left and up of it because two orangish very distant and even seemed like stars just started to dance and rotate almost orbit each other rapidly i stepped back in the house and said ((wife's name deleted)) but she didnt come out.  i looked back and they horizontally and rapidly sped away in opposite direction.  i could have sworn they just stopped and turned into stars you now what i mean?  did they dissapear just in front of that star?   i just didnt know.  I have to say that i have experienced anxiety and depression in t! he past and even recently but this type of anxiety and feeling is way new.  Just thinking of it and imagining it is making me feel so tense. my eyes get wide and tears just pour out litterally.  im not crying though...  It was just so amazing. also, i yelled for my wife ((name deleted)) because i think it was end of march when we were both sitting out here and bothed wathed what we believed to be a tea lantern floating slowly up and both said how pretty it was. and then it just stopped. and it floated. and it never burnt out. and i can tell you now 1000 percent honest that it turned into or burnt out perfectly in front of arcturus. so. i stepped out immediately lit cigarette. looked up immediately saw plane traveling normal height blinking lights red and white obvious plane.  then notice acrturus pretty uch south above it look west immediately see them next to jupiter going crazy around each other. from me stepping out to watching them spinning around time lapsed about 10- 20 seconds.  stepped in ((wife's name deleted)) stepped right out immediately saw them travel opp! osite di rections horizontally. time lapsed now maybe 30 seconds. i stare. nothing. i look south perfect horizontal white non blinking perfect steady moving like a satelite and dissapears. ive seen many satelites. i just wouldnt call it one. arcturus is my favorite star and jupiter my favorite to look at through telescope. i not an alien wacko. END.... sorry so sloppy. just had to type while so fresh in my mind. Thank you for your time.  Sinerely, ((name deleted)).  I live in Springfield Oregon, im a dishwasher in a restaurant. Im married and have a 12 year old daughter. i own my home i dont rent.  I love nature and the outdoors.  I am passionate about many things such as human rights animal rights and the environment.  I grew up in yuma arizona on the border of mexico and had a sighting similar to phoenix light there when a kid but never thought about it again until now. so yea im just a normal guy practicing compassian and tollerance in todays speedy world and raising a little girl so th! at hopefully she just leaves this earth better then she found it as well. i have to work in the morning and im usually in bed by now.  This is tough it realy is.  I woke my wife up shortly after because i just had to tell her.  i just felt crazy absolutely crazy telling her. She believes me though because of what we saw together not that long ago. I ahve to say that after seeing it all and before i woke up katy i just remember thinking my eyes are clear and fine. I wasnt groggy. i didnt get teray from a yawn or anything....my brain says no way man but my eyes saw that. what was that? and lastly. the first thing i did was look on youtube and there was a vid posted in texas 20 minutes prior of something similar. i posted a omment. it was a shaky vid though. I dont own a vid cam. i dont use a cell phone. I would take a pollygraph. i just want to know the truth. what the hell did i see tonight??",

As I was traveling north on Derr Rd. in Springfield, Ohio, I looked up to see two orange lights traveling at what appeared to be aircraft speed in a South/Southeastern direction.  At first a believed that they were planes or helicopters but the light was orange and constant (not flashing).  There were a few small clouds floating around in the area so I could tell that one was higher than the other but they were traveling at the same speed in the same direction. After about two minutes going in a straight path the higher one stopped immediately as the lower one continued on.  A third orange light appeared just above the one that had stopped.  The two lights stayed in that position for around 30 seconds then began a very fast circle as if chasing one another.  As the two performed the circle the lower stopped abruptly and just sat in one position. The two lights moving in a circle flashed once and were gone.  There was still sunlight in the sky, enough to see a silhouette of a plane if thats what it was, but there was nothing.  They were both completely gone. Immediately after the two dissapeared the third made a very sharp angled u-turn travelled a short distance flashed once and vanished just as the first two did.  I watched the surrounding sky for 30 minutes after to see if there were any more or any commercial aircrafts in the area but there were none.",

It went behind a tree, I took my phone out of my pocket, and my neighbor asked if it was raining. A few seconds later, I started recording at exactly 7:37 PM. I assume it is the same light, due to the brightness. As I was recording, it also looked like there was something black over the light.  However, I could not see what that was clearly. The light appeared to head in a North direction, and soon started to disappear. This to me appeared to be from going through the clouds.

The sky was very dark, with little cloud and very bright stars. We were close to Springfield, Ohio when I noticed a very large bright flashing white light with a small flashing red light on one side, and a small flashing green light on the other. Because of the flashing side lights, I initially thought it was an airplane, and it was just extra bright against the dark sky.  But as we got closer to it, the white light was bigger, and it appeared that the light was hovering in place, not moving. I then thought maybe it was a warning light attached to a tower, as there are many along I-70 West, although the warning lights are typically all white or all red. As we drove by it, it was not over the highway, but off to the side over the trees and fields.  I was able to see it briefly because I was driving.  I looked up at it and could see underneath. It was not attached to a tower, but was a rectangle shape that seemed to be standing still in the sky.  It did not have the body shape of an airplane and there were no wings.  The bulk of the underneath was the white light, and the two smaller lights were on either side. I could hardly believe what I saw, but there was no safe place to pull over so I kept driving and my daughter watched behind as we drove away from it.  It did not appear to move to her, and she did not see wings or a tower either.  She continued to watch it, until my driving caused her to lose sight of it.",

At approximately 2:00 PM, I was driving north on 65 highway and saw a silver shape in the sky ahead of me, to my northwest moving east.  I got closer to it and identified the shape as rectangular; proportions similar to a semi trailer or possibly slightly longer.  It was traveling slower than a helicopter and slightly higher than helicopters usually fly.  It was pretty low. The craft was sharp and clear.  Size, thumb at arm\u2019s length would probably cover the height but not the length.  It seemed to have two sections.  The back section was the same height but only about \u00bc or &#8531; the length of the leading section.  The sections were slightly separated although there was some sort of narrow bar between the sections connecting them. The rectangle was a burnished silver color.  The bottom was darker, I suppose because the sun was not shining directly on it.  Between the two sections it was much brighter except for the bar.  It either had a light source or perhaps it was the angle of the sun. I don\u2019t know.  There were disruptions in the texture along the side of the front section.  They were indistinct.  They didn't look like windows but there was something different along the side in four or five noticeable areas. I took the sunshine street exit and while stopped at the traffic light at the bottom of the ramp, the object crossed my path about a quarter mile in front of me.  Nobody else seemed to see it and I was trying to catch another driver's eye to look up but I was unsuccessful.  I wanted to take a photo but there was no place to pull over so I decided to follow it by turning east on Sunshine.  I followed for about 3 miles impeded by traffic.  It was travelling in an ESE direction.  Sunshine goes directly east.  Soon I was looking at the back of it and it was pulling away from me.  There was traffic and no place to pull over until it was nothing but a silver spec in the sky.  It looked like it would cross hwy 60 just south of Rogersville.   At that point I was able to pull over.  I got out of the car and could no longer see anything of the object.  I immediately called my husband at 2:18 pm, and told him what I had seen.",

I was not wearing a watch, but the weather news (Channel 3 KYTV broadcasts 10:35 PM - 11:37 PM) had just started when I went inside to tell my husband what I had seen.  While I have been writing this report, midnight has come and gone so this is Thursday, July 21, 2016, and it covers an event which occurred on Wednesday, July 20. The sky was clear and I could see some stars.  I was facing east when I caught a glimpse of a very large object over my left shoulder.  It appeared to be moving through the sky in a straight line from SW to NE and disappeared from view behind tree tops in my neighbor\u2019s yard. It took about five seconds to cover less than a 90 degree portion of the sky. There is a full moon, tonight.  I know that the moon seems larger near the horizon than it does at the zenith, so it is difficult to compare the size of what I saw to the size of the moon \u2013 but the object was gigantic, more like the moon than anything else in the sky \u2013 exactly the size of a nearby street light, and as bright.  I do not mean that it illuminated the ground, but that it appeared as bright as the street light I could see at the same time. The object was yellow with a tinge of red, and looked like a flame without any sparks or smoke.  It was nearly round, tapering just a little toward the back end, but it had no tail, left no trail.  It did not blink or change its intensity. It was silent. Our local meteorologist says that, at that time, the wind was from the south at 8 miles per hour.",

Headed home near the Springfield Airport, pulled into driveway, and my wife had remarked how it was so nice we could still see the sky here.  I glanced just for a second, and focused for a moment on what I thought was a constellation...  As my wife headed inside I noticed these were in fact objects (I believe to be aircraft flying at extremely high-altitude, perhaps satellites) flying at a slow pace in a triangular flight pattern with the lead object at a much lower altitude (brighter light). As I continued to focus on this area the objects maintained their slow pace & pattern.  I have seen some of the stealth bombers flying in formation out here, in broad daylight, but those were flying at a much lower altitude (and the emission trail was unbelievable!)... being familiar with star-gazing I wouldn't put it past it that these were satellites... but I have NEVER seen so many satellites flying in a formation pattern like aircraft, I would imagine if these were satellites, they'd be at a relatively lower orbit than the many times I've seen satellites 'skipping' along before. There were at least 6 in one formation, with another two groups that I could see of around 6 or so staggered at the same incredible altitude.

The bright light was not from high beams of another car, but a very, very bright light, like daylight all around me!  I could see the mountains, or hills, to my left, and I could see the color of the grass and trees as if it were daytime!  It lasted about 1.5 to 2 seconds, went back to dark, then back to the same bright light for about 0.5 to 1 second.   I drove for approximately .5 of a mile or less, before pulling over to call the Oregon State Police dispatch, to report it, and to find out if anyone else saw the bright light, or if there was an explanation.  I described the incident to the dispatch woman, and she said she would put it out there, and find out if any officers had witnessed it. To my surprise, after I made a voice recording of what I saw, there was a voicemail from t! he same dispatch woman!  She called to let me know that 2 state police officers had indeed witnessed the bright light, and didn't know what it was either!  Since the incident, I have recalled it over, and over all day today (it is still August 6).  I realize that it was a very big light, and a light that moved across the landscape and me in my car.  I know it was a very big light, because it seemed to light up landscape at least 100 feet in front  of  me, and to my left at least 200 feet or more, in my best guess. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report has reported accurately.  However, the Oregon State Patrol Dispatch [(541) 726-2536] and Lane County, Oregon, Dispatch [(541) 682-5111] report that a bulldozer, working under dubious circumstances, had struck a power pole, perhaps knocking it over, which had caused a very dramatic flash of light, and a resulting grass fire.  Emergency vehicles and utility repair personnel were dispatched to the site.  We express our gratitude to the OSP and Lane County dispatch centers for their efficient, and cheerful, assistance, which allowed our Center to solve this case quickly.  PD))",

We had quickly noticed a satellite, about 5 planes flying around some higher then others (which I found strange that there was so many planes in just that one section of the sky) and then there was this very bright light in the sky almost like a really big star, just a bright white light no color, flashing, sound or any visible form.  It wasn't twinkling or moving but it stood out from all the other stars out that night like it didn't fit in.   All of the sudden, about 30-45 seconds of us noticing it, it dropped straight down like it was landing possibly in the distance, there was no trail that came off of it no sound, no shake from impact as if it was a crash.  Just a bright big star that fell from the sky in a very odd way.",

It was not a blinking light and had no other lights with it.  The light had a fiery color to it (white to orange to red) but was completely still except for its track across the sky.  It was completely silent and moving fast.   I watched it as it disappeared to the north.  I must have been pretty high because I was able to watch it for about 2 minutes, before fading out completely.   Just as it vanished, my girlfriend said another one was coming.  Exact same light with absolutely no sound and moving at the same speed; the only difference was this one was veering off to the north-west.  Going outside to check again right now.

(I was on I-5, going south towards Springfield, in my vehicle, about 1 mile north of the Beltline.) The bright light was not from high beams of another car, but a very, very bright light, like daylight all around me!  I could see the mountains, or hills, to my left, and I could see the color of the grass and trees as if it were daytime!  It lasted about 1.5 to 2 seconds, went back to dark, then back to the same bright light for about 0.5 to 1 second. I drove for approximately .5 of a mile or less, before pulling over to call the Oregon State Police dispatch, to report it, and to find out if anyone else saw the bright light, or if there was an explanation. I described the incident to the dispatch woman, and she said she would put it out there, and find out if any officers had witnessed it.  To my surprise, after I made a voice recording of what I saw, there was a voicemail from t! he same dispatch woman!  She called to let me know that 2 state police officers had indeed witnessed the bright light, and didn't know what it was either!   Since the incident, I have recalled it over, and over all day today (it is still August 6).  I realize that it was a very big light, and a light that moved across the landscape and me in my car.  I know it was a very big light, because it seemed to light up landscape at least 100 feet in front  of  me, and to my left at least 200 feet or more, in my best guess.",

It moved at roughly the same relative speed as the jet, given the jet was probably 2000-5000 feet above me.   I assumed this shiny object was also a plane, with the Sun reflecting off it, but it made no noise whatsoever.  As it moved away, it took on the appearance of two lights, but i can't vouch for that as I sometimes see slightly double at a distance.  The brightness, considering this was broad daylight and a completely cloudless sky, and the complete lack of noise were enough to make me think twice.   When it disappeared behind a tree, I got up and exited our backyard to the parking lot behind our house to get another look.

I am however beside my self trying to grasp the reality of what I have been witnessing. When I first noticed something \"odd,\" it was some kind of \"something\" I didn't know what, that streaked across the sky at a quick as lightning speed, it was by accident that I happened to notice these things and they were so fast if I blinked I would miss it.  After some time I then realized the origin of where they were coming from.  To the East of my location I have a pretty good view of the mountains a good estimate of the distance from me to there I would say somewhere between 2 to 4 miles, 2 at the least and 4 at the most, this being a straight shot.  This is Weyerhaeuser property.  When the day light begins to fade and dusk is setting in, just on the ridge of the mountain top there you will notice a illuminating light coming from behind the mountain, if you see the light an watch closely you will notice what looks to be something like an orb, light in color, white/bluish most often, occasionally red shoot straight up in the sky, so fast it almost seems like it was just shot from a sling shot, if you blink you will miss it.  As i became more aware of these things and knew what to look for the more i questioned my reality, i am trying to grasp and comprehend what this is that i am seeing. Recently i have noticed some changes in what i knew as routine, also in appearance. Each Orb, as i referred to them as that shot off from over that mountain top came directly over head of my location, gradually made a u turn and shot off into the distance, destination unknown.  Then i saw one, closer and reduced speed i noticed after making a u turn the object is not an orb at all, they are disks and from looking underneath it's clear to see it is a disk shape outlined with lights.  Now that i know this i can recognize these disks at random in the sky and what i suspect trying to hide their presence behind what i thought were clouds.  The \"clouds\" also illuminate the white lights shaping the discs so although one could easily not notice, one could notice if they knew what to look for. These sightings have been going on for months now, i have been committed to watching, observing, and trying to learn more about these objects.  What shocks me and the more i learn the more shocked i get is, I sware on my life and everything i love, even on my only child i am telling the truth when i say there are hundreds of these things, possibly thousands.  There are signs of some kind of intelligence from these things might i just add.  They are there every day, and every night.  I really hope that there is somebody out there that can tell me what these things are exactly, what their purpose is, possible their intentions, something.  Tell me i'm wrong, but don't tell me i'm crazy. I can't help feeling frightened at times wondering what is the meaning behind these things?  And i can't help but to feel some excitement of the idea. what are they doing here? and what could there possibly be over that mountain top that they are so interested in? Where do they go when they shoot off into the sky?  Why are there so many of them?  And why the hell has nobody els seen these things?  Who do i even tell about what i'm seeing?  And would they even believe me?  Well that's why i am writing this now, where it goes and what comes of it i can only wait to find out. I will follow up on the situation in soon time for those that are curious, and believe what i am saying. I am telling the truth, i don't care to be ridiculed over something i hesitated and debated even speaking up about.  Don't pass judgement until you see for yourself, that's fair enough and all i ask. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

While observing the lunar eclipse, I noticed objects in the sky going west to east at a high rate of speed.  The objects were grouped in 3 vee formations side by side of 2 or 3.  The objects were lighter than the clear black sky which is why my attention was brought to them.   The entire event transpired over only a few seconds which left me puzzling if I had actually seen them, but suddenly I saw 2 more objects following in a position that would have been to the left (as oriented looking to the east as the moon progressed) of the original grouping.  The sky was very clear and very black and the objects were at extreme altitude as they passed at a rapid clip and soon vanished.   These objects moved so much faster than any other extraterrestrial objects that I have observed since seeing Telstar as a youth.",

When I walked outside to see if any other houses had the problem I saw the object two houses down.  The object was very metallic but not in a normal way,  Almost like a black silver or a locked phone screen.  It was about 8 feet long and around the circumference of two adult oak trees.  It looked as if it had crashed in front of my neighbor's house who came out with her husband along with me.  The object after about 4 minutes after we looked at it changed its deep black color to a very painfully bright white light before vanishing without any marks on the ground or any debris anywhere.  When I walked back inside my dogs we're barking at my front door and my power was on.",

After a few seconds I realized it was no balloon, since it was slowly moving up and down, then paused to hover for a few seconds, and looked nothing like a balloon.  I watched it move like this for about a minute before it sped off and disappeared behind the treeline.  I would guess it was about 400ft off the ground.  It was heading northeast towards the hills, about the side of a helicopter, shaped like a black saucer, and made no noise as it moved.",
