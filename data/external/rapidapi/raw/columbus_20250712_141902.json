      "story": "Glowing orange sphere, stationary and silent My brother and I both had paper routes and had just left our apartment building to go pick up our papers. This was several years ago (1966) in the early morning hours. This object was circular and was orange in color. It was about the size of the moon when the moon is overhead. ' I told my twelve-year-old brother to look and he looked up and said that it was probably the moon. It wasn't the moon because the moon was elsewhere in the sky, low but not on the horizon. I didn\u2019t know what to make of it as it was stationary and glowing orange from dim to bright. The intensity of the light was not extremely bright closer to dim but clear. It only appeared for a short time probably 30 to 45 seconds and the disappeared. There was no sound associated with it. I have thought of this from time to time over the years and have tried to think of what it could have been. The only thing I could ever come up with was a UFO. This all took place in Columbus, Ohio on the west side of what was then called Westgate Manor We lived at ((deleted)) Briggs Road.

      "story": "Long cylinder shaped UFO sighted along I-70 near Columbus Ohio. This sighting occured on the east side of Columbus while driving at approx. 3:15pm on Nov 29 2005. I was driving in an area where I had driven on numerous occasions. I was driving on the outerbelt around Columbus (I-270) traveling north. I was comming up to the overpass crossing over I-70 which runs east and west through Columbus. Being the outerbelt is generally speaking circular my perspective of the object was in continual change while I was moving. I looked east along I-70 and noticed a stationary object approx. 1/4 mile from the overpass. It was sitting just above the tree line slightly to the north of I-70. I at first thought that I was looking at a very large waving banner that was attached to something. I had never seen this in that location before. It was very promonent. I quickly realized that I was looking at a solid object that had a rippling appearance moving along its surface, moving from west to east and going around it. The object was sitting parallel to I-70 maybe 50 feet above the trees. It had the appareance of being a long pipe parallel to the ground, being somewhat longer than a tractor trailer rig and maybe 5 feet tall. I slowed down to look at it but couldn't pull over and stop on the overpass because I had traffic comming up on my rear. This is the point where the situation gets really interesting because just beyond the the I-70 overpass is an underpass for a road that parallels I-70 just to its north and as I approach this underpass I notice a dark blue and/or black helicopter with no markings circling the overpass. I assume that the chopper can see the object but looking straight east now I can no longer see it. From this perspective I would now be looking at it's west end. I at this point look into my rear view mirror and see a dark blue sedan of matching color right behind me. It appeared to be a current model unmarked Chevy Impala that had a beacon on top.(the beacon wasn't on and may have been some type of detection equipment for all I know) The beacon and it's lenses and the windows of the car matched the color of the car so it's interior could't be seen. As I passed under the road crossing over I-270 the sedan pulled over and stopped under the underpass that the helicopter was circling. I must comment about the synchronistic aspects of this happening. This was my third non disk shaped close UFO encounter but the only one I have reported.(the other two encounters were actually closer as I was right under them) I have had four other encounters with the black helicopters but had nothing to do with UFO's. I appeared to be the focus of their attention. At the time of this happening I was scheduled to go to the UFO conference three days later in Virginia beach at the A.R.E.",

There were no sounds, and it is a very clear night.  I would think they were quite a distance away.  I would guess that they were helicopters, but I have never seen lights behave thay way before.

I immediately sent my daughter back in to get her father and the binoculars.  When they came out my husband looked through the binoculars and exclaimed that there were many smaller ones too.  We all took turns looking and there were roughly 50 smaller ones between the bigger 3 that were nearly impossible to see with the naked eye. At first glanc,e the large ones looked like stationary explosions, but through the binoculars you could see them moving in place at different rates.  They looked eerily similar to what protein folding looks like.  We got out our telescope and kept observing until we couldn't see them anymore.  They slowly spread out but still stayed in a rough triangle.   Eventually, we could only see one, and then none.  This was all during a cloudless sunny afternoon.",

I experienced this with my girl friend at the time, but while she admits to me that this happened it seems that this experience really freaked her out. She asked that I not include her in the story. I got home from work, stepped out of my car in the driveway when I heard a resonating vibration sound that seemed to drown out everything else.  I looked due East across the street and about fifty to one hundred feet above the houses was a large black cube sitting in the air.  The craft did not seem to have any lights and it did not move suddenly.   All I could do was stare; I thought of taking a picture and the camera was just inside the house, but I couldn\u2019t move. It seemed as if time stopped. The cube was approximately the size of two homes in my neighborhood which would be about 3000sqft total; the outer texture like a borg cube on Star Trek.  The cube began to move slowly toward the south directly above the houses and I started to see a very light gray puff of smoke coming from what had become apparent to me was the rear of the craft. There were three light gray exhaust-like openings where the smoke was coming from, but the smoke very quickly dissipated as the craft moved south. I watched until the craft was too small on the horizon to see any longer; it was weird how no one seemed to be around except the person traveling with me that day until I could no longer hear the resonating vibration sound. Then when the cube was too far to distinguish, cars began passing by like normal and I saw neighbors coming and going; it was as if someone had their fingers in my ears and quickly removed them. I talked about the experience with the person traveling with me that day and their account was exactly what I had experienced. This happened about four to five years ago and I am still getting goose bumps and every hair on my body is standing up while I type this. I had never had anything like this happen before and have not since although I mentally prepare for the next encounter, hoping I can get a picture or video of this cube. Background: I was 25 years old at the time of this experience.  I am a non-denominational Christian and for the majority of my life never believed anything like this would ever happen to me. I figured most UFO sightings were either drug induced or exaggerations. I have held a full time job all my adult life, enjoy my work and am for the most part a happy person.

      "story": "White and Yellow shiny starlike object moving irrationally and gracefully My friend and I (3:39 am) had the windows in my apartment open and saw a asterisk esque shining light hovering around closely and far away. We watched it for 5 or 6 minutes to see if it was making the path to the airport east of here. We were unnerved to see that it was tilting back and forth, in a seesaw sort of motion across the sky. The colors would slowly shift, some colors hard to see, but some colors were white and yellow. When it had no lights on, the body indicated a very soft-edged cone shape with irrationally placed red lights. Its path circled in a diameter around the general downtown area. It was disturbing because it looked so defiantly different than the typical police helicopters, care flights, and airplanes. That had a lot to do with its non-linear path, and slow, but very graceful speed. I've never seen something like this before and wanted some insight on similar sightings, I didn't know if maybe extremely distant helicopters can give this impression, but then I doubt that. I doubt it because the light was very profile, it never moved in a three dimensional fashion, just sort of gave the illusion of moving two dimensionally. The irrational red and white blinking lights moved about this dark cone like object irrationally. It's also important to note that it was very large and resembled a huge shining star. One more thing to note is that you could not hear it like an airplane or helicopter. Two witnesses: Male",

Joint Investigation by NUFORC and MUFON of Georgia, Fireball, Columbus Georgia  Occurred : 11/29/2006 16:00 (Entered as : 11292006 16:00) Reported: 11/30/2006 5:27:48 AM 05:27 Posted: 12/7/2006 Location: Columbus, GA Shape: Fireball Duration: Unknown  (NOTE:  Readers, for a full understanding of the following described inquiry, please see full original witness account at NUFORC; Columbus Georgia, Fireball, Posted 12/7/2006).  Recap-  A resident of Columbus Georgia, a retired educator holding a PhD, was reportedly ill on 28Nov06 and did not follow the normal local news of the day.  The next day, on 29Nov06, he discovered the circumstances of the 28Nov06 Columbus suspected 'airplane crash' as covered by the local TV station and newspaper.  At that point, he was mystified by certain events that had occurred earlier that day (29th) in relation to the Columbus Airport, said area which he had driven past in his automobile.  These unusual events described by the witness at the airport involved an alleged unmarked 727 that was taxied close to the adjacent roadway, and was suspected of causing the witness' passing vehicle to stall, as if some unknown electronic device was in operation from within the craft. Other unusual circumstances relating to this are described in the original account. The below described inquiry attempted to sort out all of the matters described by the witness in his NUFORC statement, which basically alleged that something unknown was recovered and then secretly removed from Columbus Georgia by agencies unknown.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  On Thursday evening, 7Dec06, Peter Davenport, the Director of the National UFO Reporting Center, contacted this writer and described the account posted by the witness in this case. An agreement was reached to further scrutinize the situation.  Unavoidable events then occurred which delayed movement on this investigation in the desired prompt manner.  This writer was in the process of returning to MUFON after a 2+ year absence, and was in a transitional phase.  Furthermore the MUFON representative in Columbus Georgia had suffered an extreme medical condition which left him permanently disabled, and no other FIs were in close proximity.  This writer lives some 75 miles north of Columbus. Then during the first phases of the investigation, this FI developed an extreme case of the flu and bronchitis, with pneumonia, which lasted several weeks, most of which I was unable to speak properly.  This writer contacted the witness by both phone and email and further discussed the account.  He was asked, and stated he would inquire, if his associate PhD, his passenger on 29Nov06, would also submit an account.  (This account was never produced).  During these conversations, the witness stated that the local TV meteorologist (name on file) had stated that he had noticed a return on his Doppler radar unit about the time of the purported 'plane crash' on 28Nov06, and that he had spoken to this meteorologist.  This writer identified the meteorologist and placed repeated phone calls to him which were NEVER returned.  An email also went UNANSWERED, as did a letter posted to him at the TV station.  The witness had also described a quickly formed task force of search personnel that had been formed on 28Nov06 shortly after a 'crash witness' had phoned 911.  This search party consisting of Columbus Police and Fire/Rescue, FAA, and soldiers from the adjacent massive Fort Benning.  (NOTE: Sidebar-  This writer recalls seeing this large search operation covered by the local Atlanta TV stations, and the Columbus authorities stating, at sometime prior to 11:00PM, that no downed aircraft had been found).  The area of the suspected downed aircraft, vicinity of 8801 Macon Road, is the location of the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft facility. Furthermore said Macon Rd. actually forms part of the northern perimeter of the Fort Benning Army Base.  From past experience, this writer is aware that any major public safety emergency IMMEDIATELY outside of the base has been responded to by Army emergency personnel due to the the possible effects on the base itself and due to the Army being a 'good neighbor' to the local Columbus authorities.  Thus a response by the Army Military Police, Provost, or base public safety personnel, is not unusual in a case such as a possible downed aircraft.  In this same vein, this writer contacted the Director of Security for the Pratt & Whitney facility (name on file).  He stated that he recalled the afternoon of the event.  The police had sent an officer out ahead to check on conditions as the search was organized and deployed.  He spoke to the officer, but could report nothing vital.  The DirSec's office is elevated, and he stated that it overlooks most of the area in question in a panoramic view, and that he had noticed nothing extraordinary such as a crashing aircraft or similar.  This writer also contacted the Columbus Police i.e. 911 Center to locate records of the initial emergency call and the original 'plane crash' witness.  This writer was bounced around to different divisions, and generally ignored for days on end.  Past professional contacts in that agency maintained when this writer was a Chief of Police had been transferred or also retired.  This investigator then filed a request for records under the 'Georgia Open Records Act', a state law similar to the FOIA.  This produced what was described as the only record relating to the event (since they maintain that nothing was found), a 911 dispatch card.  It listed the original caller's name and not much else.  The nature of the 'call' was described as \"Caller sts seen a plane go down north east of Pratt Whitney\".  Time received 15:56:14; Time dispatched 15:56:19; Time arrived 16:08:52.  This writer phoned the name listed as the original 911 witness, with NO response.  A complete letter of explanation of our needs, insuring confidentiality, and a SASE, was then mailed to the witness, again with NO response.  This writer also filed detailed FOIA covering all aspects of this matter to the FAA.  On 30March07, the FAA responded stating that \"........searched our files........could NOT find any records responsive to your request....\"  During this inquiry, the writer earlier contacted a journalist with the largest Columbus newspaper (organ and name on file).  This individual had demonstrated in past years that he was a friend of Ufology, of MUFON of Georgia and ISUR in particular.  All aspects were explained to him as well as request for informational help through his various contacts among the local government and community.  He agreed to 'make some calls' and pass any info to this writer.  This individual developed nothing more than what was already known about the search for a downed aircraft, which he had monitored on his public safety scanner.  Also contacted was the Air Force Space Command.  This writer sent a request to Lieutenant ______ ______, USAF (name on file) explaining what information we sought  regarding returning space junk and re-entering debris.  The answer came on 5Jan07, indicating that the 1st Space Command Control Squadron at Cheyenne Mountain AF Station confirmed that there was NO returning orbital debris being tracked in the vicinity of the southeastern USA at the times in question.  Likewise the Joint Space Operations Center Weather Flight that there were no unusual space or terrestrial weather phenomena observed during the same time period.  A note added, in order to discuss meteors, refer to NASA.  The following data highlights should be noted, as it was taken directly from the data base of NUFORC, regarding the following states in the southeastern USA;  28Nov06, between 4:00PM  and 9:00PM and later;  Georgia- EST zone- Dacula, 7PM, Bright green object like shooting star, seemed to stop....moved on. Nahunta, 7PM, fireball observed, no color given. Dalton, 7PM, fireball observed, long tail, shooting across sky, changing pink and green, broke into 2-3 pieces, vanished.  Rome 6:35PM, fireball glowing green, NW to south, broke up into several pieces, appeared to strike earth, witness suspected space debris or meteor. Lawrenceville 6:30PM, very bright green light 'eyebrow shape', silent, very high-speed. Rising Fawn, 6:15PM, 2 round green lights falling toward horizon, aqua-green, no tail, like pencil erasure held AAL, witness later heard Chattanooga weather report of fireball meteors.  Alabama- CST zone- Birmingham, 1st, 5:30PM, Blu-grn ball of light; 2nd, 5:30PM, green light streaking across sky, thicker tail than meteor, seemed close to ground, went over a 'mountain', gone; 3rd, 5:30PM, large round bright green circle, WNW to ESE, seemed to be meteor; 4th, brilliant green light to NE, quicker than a plane, 45 degree angle to earth, lost behind trees; 5th, 5:30PM, large green fireball, W to E, surrounded by glowing white light, tail like a comet, next day news said NASA had no meteor reports, news called it a 'UFO\".  Pinson, 5:35PM, fireball, white then turned green, vanished behind trees....said landed 2 miles away. Huntsville, 5:30PM, bright green light, traveled east over Chapman Mountain, very fast, wife saw same from different location miles away, like Roman Candle. Bremen, 5:30PM, bright green fireball, falling, resembled fire works display.  (NOTE: Alabama Sidebar--The 'Decatur Alabama Daily News' ran a story in their 29Nov06 edition.  \"Lights in Sky Probably Space Junk or Meteor\".  Thumbnail--The 911 Center in Morgan County began receiving calls at 5:28PM CST on 28Nov06, that a brilliant lime-green light had appeared and the callers were claiming it was a 'downed aircraft'.  A multi-agency public safety search effort was mounted in the area and no downed aircraft was found.  Local astronomers went on to describe space junk, and so forth.  Including that lime-green would be consistent with burning aluminum re-entering the earth's atmosphere. A University of Alabama astronomer stated the \"sightings were too late to be explained by the meteor shower that took  place last week\".  (Leonids).  Article went on to discuss bolides, the differences in the way the human eye perceives color and a recent golf shot made by a Russian cosmonaut that hit a golf ball into orbit to become 'space junk').  Tennessee, split into EST and CST zones- Knoxville, 1st, 10:45PM, 8-10 blu-grn lights, very bright, circular, largest like 1/2 moon, others smaller, E to SE, seemed 60-100mph, large aircraft like a 'tanker' seen following behind; 2nd, 6:30PM, 5 very bright blue lights, silent, passed overhead, vanished, distant boom then heard, 5 minutes another boom; 3rd, 6:30PM, large blue fireball, moving east, unlike 'shooting star', traveled 180 degrees, broke into 2-3 pieces, reminded witness of shuttle breakup. Chattanooga, 6:30PM, bright green light, silent, as if 100 feet above ground, intense light, looked as if had 2 parts, shot forward then gone, policeman stopped, got out and looked.  Soddy Daisy, 6:30PM, 2 bright green lights close to horizon, falling at angle, witness says could make out a cylinder or cigar shape from which lights seem to come.....vanished.....neighbor saw same driving miles away. Oliver Springs, fireball, streak of light, NW to ESE, saw 4-5 balls develop from it, burned, went dark.  Kentucky, split into EST and CST zones. Stanford, 6:30PM, very fast green light, W to E, strange shade of green.  Hyden, 5:00PM, 7-8 blu-grn lights, appeared far away, detected circular motion.  North Carolina, EST zone.  Marshall, 7:00PM, green light, too fast for an aircraft, S to N, seemed 5 inches off horizon AAL.  Marble, 6:50PM, bright green light, silent, illuminated clouds, moving to NE, seemed 3000-4000 feet, 200-400 mph.  Boone, 6:40PM, fireball, large, bright green, poorly defined edges, clouds glowing green, changed direction slowly. Franklin, 6:25PM, 2 green lights, very fast, down then upwards, silent, one ahead of the other.  While there is a difference in times, directions, and exact descriptions, there is enough probable cause therein to indicate there was in fact something afoot in the SE skies of the USA the evening of 28Nob06.  TOO MANY similarities not to have been connected to the same, or a series of, related aerial event(s).  It's obvious from past investigations that a bolide, fireball, large meteor, or huge returning space junk, can be seen by ground observers MANY hundreds of miles apart. Likewise large meteor showers.  Past investigations have found CREDIBLE witnesses that all believed the light/object/fireball observed went to ground nearby when it actually traveled over the horizon, sometimes into another state.  A good example of this was a SC police helicopter pilot who made such an observation on the Ga/SC state line.  He was preparing to call out the search parties for a downed aircraft and actually landed his chopper to refuel so as to cross into Georgia to assist.  The object observed on that occasion was later tracked by citizen's reports across Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and on into Arkansas.  During the course of this investigation, it was found that the previously orbiting Russian reconnaissance satellite Cosmos 2423 was launched on 14Sept06 and it's orbit began to decay before completion of it's expected appx. 120 day mission (possible mechanical malfunction).  Various sources indicated that the breakup began on or about 17-18November 2006 and the satellite was then destroyed at some point by ground command to better control any resulting impact damage and to prevent 'foreign' intelligence services' from retrieving any possible surviving components.  The U.S. Space Command indicated that Cosmos 2423 generated 28 cataloged fragments, NORAD catalog numbers 29604-29631. Additional speculation is that the now smaller Cosmos 2423 fragments might have taken as long as 30 days to re-enter the atmosphere, which puts the 28Nov06 date well within that window.  One would like to think that the US Space Command would not be intentionally deceitful to the American public regarding requests for information, but in matters dealing with intelligence about reconnaissance efforts of a potential future foe, I'm not so sure.  In fact, in such a case, I would fully EXPECT such matters to remain confidential within our military and intelligence community.  Additional speculation on my part is that IF anything HAD been recovered during the Columbus Georgia 'downed aircraft search', and it rose to the level of requiring the find to remain secret or confidential, the Columbus Municipal Airport would be the last place used to remove it from the local scene.  The Columbus Airport is only some 4+ miles from the Ft. Benning base perimeter, and the location of the 'search' area is practically atop the base's northern property line (Macon Road vicinity).  Fort Benning Georgia is IMMEDIATELY adjacent the City of Columbus.  This fort is one of the largest U.S. Army installations in the world, and is the home of the Army's Airborne School, the Headquarters of the 75th Ranger Regiment, and the Infantry School. Official records indicate that Fort Benning, and it's various training commands, is serviced from within by Lawson Army Airfield which is capable of, and does, land the largest aircraft owned by the U.S. Government; the C-5, C-17, C-141, C-130 and others.  It is this writer's opinion that anything requiring such secrecy as described by the witness would have been flown out of Lawson Army Airfield.  Doing so would give TOTAL and COMPLETE control and security to such a confidential process.  Such security would be marginal, or non-existent, at a civilian municipal airport.  This is not to say that such a municipal airport has not been used during certain government projects, but again, anything arising to such a confidential level would be routed through a government installation if at all possible.......there is no doubt in my mind. Under such conditions it would be difficult indeed to prove for certain that anything clandestine took place.  As to the circumstances of the event occurring on the airport access road i.e. the witness unexplained stalled vehicle near a 727 aircraft.  Over the course of this inquiry, the writer has touched base with various former and retired persons with a background in military intelligence and other electronic 'specialists'.  Speculations vary, but in the opinion of one 'specialist', an electronic system that might cloak or disrupt the outside monitoring of the aircraft systems or communications........\"I would not be surprised if such devices exist.  But effecting nearby electronic components?  Likely not\".  He went on to describe the need for this that some military aircraft might have......Air Force One, but such system would have to be discrete, being vital that it NOT affect other systems........further describing sound cancellation devices........additionally, the one successfully used with some Black Hawk helicopters and similar techniques used in our submarines.  It's apparent that the Georgia 'downed aircraft witness' saw something that led to notifying the authorities.  So did the witnesses in Decatur/Morgan County Alabama, both events leading to an official ground search.  Did pieces of Russian Cosmos 2423 or some other satellite or space junk come down in the southeastern USA?  Not according to the USAF Space Command.  Did the southeastern skies experience the 'Green Fireball' phenomenon as have other parts of the USA in the past?  Perhaps.  Was a truly anomalous event, including unknown craft, involved?  Maybe.  The NUFORC and MUFON of Georgia wishes to take this opportunity to appeal to ALL future witnesses........when reporting any unknown aerial event, please do not hesitate to provide full information.  NUFORC Director Peter Davenport and the MUFON organization sometimes need ADDITIONAL information in cases that might prove vital to our understanding of the various aerial phenomenon.  Your identity will be protected to the fullest extent.  Who knows?  It could be you that provides the clue to opening up a whole new chapter in the study of these mysteries.

But it was the summer of 97 or 98. I was driving northbound to my office in Columbus, Ohio and stopped at my usual fast food place for breakfast. I pulled around the back of the building to the service window. As I stopped at the window I looked up and noticed straight in front of me but maybe a block or two away, a giant (30-40 feet tall)Teddy Bear floating in the sky right above the trees. I thought I was seeing things for a second then realized it must be a hot air balloon although where the basket would be was below the tree tops. It floated past the corner of the building I was next to so I couldn't see it any longer. I laughed and told the cashier what I saw when he waited on me. He stuck his head out the window but it was already out of sight. A few moments later he gave me my order and I drove forward. As I turned around the corner of the building I looked to where the object should be based on it's speed and direction. There was nothing there. Before I pulled back onto the main street I looked all around and up. It had disappeared. Because of the flatness of the area and lack of large trees or tall buildings the only way I could explain it disappearing was if it had crashed behind a home and lost it's air in the short time between when I saw it float past the building and when I pulled up. I listened to the local news that evening to hear if there had been a balloon crash or even a balloon show. Nothing was mentioned. As nutty as this sounds it really happened just as I wrote.

      "story": "(Cols,Ohio) 2 bright objects, great distance from each other move in exact unison from W into SW Sky, disappear simultaneously My husband and I stepped outside last Wednesday evening, around 11pm June 20th.    It was a lovely evening, clear skies in all directions.   He faced East, I turned to look at the moon hanging in the western sky. I immediately noticed a very very bright object moving out of the west, moving very fast.   I began to ask my husband if it was probably a satellite, because I could not see any type of blinking as with most airplanes. We squinted, trying to decipher if there was blinking or not,  but he saw no blinking either. Right then we both noticed a second very bright object following at the exact same speed, in the exact same direction as the first.  From the ground, the bright objects would have appeared about 8-10 inches apart, so I don\u2019t know what the actual distance would calculate to be,   but they were in unison , appearing as if the second object were being towed along.  We deliberated for a minute or two, concluding, that for satellites,  they were flying at a really low elevation ,  looking like they were inside our atmosphere,  not orbiting outside of it;   And they were so bright,  as compared to most satellites which are usually only as bright as the stars & moving across the sky at a slow but steady rate.  My husband and I are very reasonable, logical people.   It was our instinct to dismiss the objects as some logical device which was operating normally in the sky. However,  standing there\u2026.. suggesting, squinting, contemplating the possibilities of what they were,  we suddenly saw the first object fade quickly and disappear completely. We were both astounded at this point.     Questioning why and where it could have gone,   watching the second object follow the same path,  & at the exact same place in the sky,\u2026\u2026it too faded very quickly and disappeared completely. By now we were absolutely confused at what in the world we could be seeing.              The sky was completely clear &  the objects were gone, just like that.  They traveled out of the western sky in unison, and disappeared into the Southwestern sky at the same place in the sky. We talked excitedly and returned inside after a few moments.   My husband headed to bed.   I sat down to watch some Tv. At about 1am,  I was too curious to sleep without knowing, so I called Rickenbacher Airport, and was transferred to airport operations. I explained to the man on the phone, and he confirmed that he also saw the objects in the sky at that time.   He remembered seeing them because he too noticed how fast they were traveling. He had no actual confirmation,   but assumed the first object we saw was the international space station,  because it \u2018probably\u2019 has its solar panels out right now.  I said okay,   and mentioned again that they seemed so close,   too close to be floating outside of the earth. I asked him what was trailing it so far behind the object at the same speed, and he said he did not know what that could have been.     He told me they appeared to disappear  because at a certain point on the horizon, the sunlight does not reach the object anymore and it appears to disappear.     I accepted this. My husband brought up the point that the objects were no where near the horizon,   they were way up in the sky, almost overhead.    Im sure it is possible though.  My father keeps  suggesting it was the Space station and that the object behind it was probably the space shuttle which would be docked on it or very close.  However,   the distance even from our view was already too far for the objects to be docked together,  let alone what the actual distance would be up there. He also supported the disappearing horizon theory.  When I thought about it later  I realized Rickenbacher is a military installation.   I had called them thinking they would be a better authority than Port Columbus,    but now I realize, if there were anything unidentified up there,    a military installation would be the last to confirm it.  And so we left it at that.        No answers for the boatload of questions in our minds.  I have seen now that a Pilot flying over the English Channel last week, along with his passengers, all witnessed a very large Unidentified craft outside of their windows.      After it moved out of site,  the pilot stated that a second object appeared 5 minutes later.  I do not know whether the two sightings are related but I see an amazing coincidence between the timing and actual objects seen. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS? PD))",

I was at Como Park on top of a very large mound that the kids sled off of in the winter, and ride bikes down in the spring, and locals sunbathe on top of it.  Anyway, my family and I decided to take a walk at the park that day, and I noticed how things seemed to be illuminated.  I don't know expactly how to explain it but I'll try...Flowers seemed brighter, more vivid, I told my boyfriend how absolutely beautiful it was and how great I was feeling, which is unusual, I usually hurt when I've been walking for a while.  Anyway, towards the end of the walk, on our way out of the park, we stopped to relax and fly a kite on the mound. I laid down on the grass, at the top of the mound, wearing my sun glasses, and started looking around, just taking it all in (again this day was different somehow illuminated), and noticed kind of an aura above the trees that line the park.  I'm commenting to my boyfriend all the beauty that I am taking special notice of, and laying on my back I look straight ahead and a little to the left and I notice what at first glance I thought to be birds darting back and forth at each other.  I did'nt think much of it for a few seconds, until a hawk or some kind of bird flew in between my sight of the other whiteish objects.  So I know what I was looking at was very very far away, and thought that birds don't usually, that Im aware of dart aggressively towards one another. Upon focusing on the objects, I noticed one central one towards the top of the almost formation.  There may have been five or six others, I could'nt count them, they were moving too quickly, almost like in training, the top one did'nt do much, but the ones underneath seemed to be following orders or something. They changed from looking white, to opaque when they sped up. I even lost track of them for a few seconds even though there were no clouds in the way, maybe they were moving so fast I could'nt see them. The whole time I'm witnessing this, I'm yelling for my boyfriend to lay next to me to see what I'm seeing, he laughs at me and contiues to fly his kite.  He missed out on a once in a lifetime experience.  I was afraid to take my eyes off the area, afraid I would lose sight of them.  Finally I got my son to lay down and he got to see just as they started to disappear.  I told my boyfriend that if I saw them then someone else had to see them too.  I told him I bet the government knows their there, and I told him that I bet a jet or some type of aircraft will go to that area, and I pointed the area out to him, and maybe within a few minutes, a jet went right past that very area I pointed out.  I believe, that is the other reason my boyfriend believes me, because the jet was probably sent by the government, and he know's I would never make up a story like that, and he knows I don't lie.

Dec 13 2006 at exactly 19:35 Eastern, I was driving South on I-65 at mile-marker 71 near Columbus, IN. to the West/South-West at approximate 30 degree angle from ground and at what I estimate to be 5 to 7 miles out, I witnessed an object in the night sky. The sky was dark with a slight backlit auburn haze and distant low cloud blanket and even further out clear sky. The Object was diamond shaped with 8 light formations on what I beleive to be the belly of Craft.The Craft was a vague silloette to my eyes. The Ligh Formations on the Craft were a yellowish-white color and 8 in numbr. each of the eight light formations were composed of two rectangular segments of equal size forming a 45 degree angle pointing towards apparent front of craft. (examp. >). The 8 formations of lights were arranged in perfect geometry to the shape of the Craft. example:      ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ The individual light formations seemed to intensify while object was stationary and as light intensified, The Object began to move upwards at a 45 degree angle to the Left of It's position. The Object suddenly faded from sight as it accelerated.The Object appeared to be the size of, or larger than; a Lockheed C-5A transport plane.In my estimation, the lights did not appear to be flaming or fuel burning outlets or exhaust ports however, My gut feeling was that they had some sort of propulsion function. The Object never reappeared to my view.  Now, the other part of this event was; at the moment I assumed the object had \"disappeared\":I witnessed directly South and Approx. 30 to 35 thousand feet up at a distance from Me of est. 5-8 miles out, Two Fighter Planes rapidly pursuing a path towards the tradjectory of the craft's distant path. My reasoning that the 2 aircraft \"in pursuit\" were Fighter Jets was 1.) their speed and altitude 2.) the marker beacons on each aircraft.(one strobing white and blue marker light on each jet.) Looking at a Road Atlas later on, I noted an Airport exactly West of my position at 20 miles.(Bloomington, IN). I also know of Louisville,KY's airport/A.N.G. base to South.  I have lived near Air Force Bases and am certain that no aircraft built in U.S. have been made public knowledge, of this nature.I can accept that this craft could be Man-made or of Extraterrestrial nature. I also theorize that It could be visable by some while not visable to other Humans. P.S. I had an identicle sighting to the detail in the Mojave Dessert approx. 2 years ago.(Did not report It,then.)",

      "story": "Fast lights in a Zigzag pattern I sent this in the day after and it was never added. Please take me serious. I am a Petroleum Engineer and would like input on what this was........... I live out in the country on a small ranch. I went out in the backyard around 10:30 PM to take the dogs out, a normal routine prior to going to bed. I usually have a great view of the sky and love to star gaze. Blinking lights on the NW horizon amongst the trees caught my attention. At first I thought it was bright stars in the distance. But I noticed they would disappear while I stood in one place and reappear in another. As I moved to find them they would appear and disappear. I tired of this event and began looking straight up at the brilliant stars hoping for a shooting star when a series of flashing lights appeared in the western sky. At first glance it looked like a plane but as it got closer overhead I began to watch and follow its unusual movements and shape. The object was moving from west to east at a speed that was faster than an airplane, its shape was unrecognizable even though there was a full moon. The object moved in an erratic nearly snakelike formation. Many lights could be seen flashing across its middle girth in a very random, flickering red and white pattern. I couldn\u2019t judge its distance from earth nor its size but I believe it was larger than a plane. Once the object disappeared in to the eastern horizon, I heard the tremendous trailing noise of a jet-liner back to the east where the object first appeared. I noticed a flash of dull white light, similar to a lightning flash, illuminating a cloud in the sky, as the rumbling of the aircraft tried to catch up to the object. Could it have been traveling faster than light? I watched the object for 20-30 seconds and the noise lasted nearly as long.",

The object was traveling directly overhead at a slow speed (< 25 MPH) from the northeast to the southwest in the direction of downtown Columbus.  I would guess that the altitude was around 1500 \u20132000 ft.  The object was moving in a very straight line, with no changes in direction that I could tell.  There was no sound, and no lights.  I thought this was odd, because my location is approximately 3 miles due west of Port Columbus (Ohio) International Airport, in-line with the runways.  Planes are regularly approaching or taking off directly overhead, all day, everyday.  Today they have been on the approach path.  Adding to my concern was the realization that the wind was blowing the opposite direction that the object was moving.

      "story": "Drove right underneath a UFO while on the freeway--saw 3 more UFOs This happened in 1992 in late Nov/early Dec at around 7:50pm. I was driving south on 270 to a friend\u2019s house and was passing by Port Columbus Airport, when I saw on my right what at first I thought was a helicopter (being so near the airport it seemed logical). It was around the size of a helicopter but had no tail or rotors, etc. I kept looking at it because it didn\u2019t move and was a shadowy disk shape with white lights around the edge. I then thought it was only a plane coming in to land, but it just sat in the sky. I kept driving.  Then I noticed an identical UFO about 50 feet directly above a box car of a train on the Columbus & Ohio River Railroad bridge that goes right past the airport. The UFO was shining a large white light down from the center of the underside of the disk onto one of the box cars, as though it were inspecting it. The light was very wide, taking up the middle part of the underside of the UFO\u2014maybe it was at least a 7-10ft. wide searchlight. It was illuminating an entire box car and part of another.  I then noticed a third identical-looking UFO to my left in a grassy area right before the bridge. It was almost touching the ground, and it shown a bright white searchlight on the ground, too. (My truck was noisy, but I could not hear any noise from the UFOs). I passed under the railroad bridge, directly under the one UFO above it. I became excited and exited at Broad St. instead of Main St., which is where I was originally headed. As I was about to make a U-turn to get back onto 270, I saw yet a fourth identical UFO directly in front of me, but higher in the sky and further away, possibly 500 feet away.  I made the U-turn and got back onto 270 and continued to Main St. I didn't try and go back the other way on 270 to take another look, because I would be late to an appointment. There were many cars on the freeway, so there had to be others who saw the UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

Blinking lights on the NW horizon amongst the trees caught my attention.  At first I thought it was bright stars in the distance.  But I noticed they would disappear while I stood in one place and reappear in another.  As I moved to find them they would appear and disappear.  I tired of this event and began looking straight up at the brilliant stars hoping for a shooting star when a series of flashing lights appeared in the western sky.  At first glance it looked like a plane but as it got closer overhead I began to watch and follow its unusual movements and shape.  The object was moving from west to east at a speed that was faster than an airplane, its shape was unrecognizable even though there was a full moon.   The object moved in an erratic nearly snakelike formation.  Many lights could be seen flashing across its middle girth in a very random, flickering red and white pattern.

I first noticed it while observing a large, high flying jet. The jet was flying at an altitude that still allowed its shape to be discernable.  I am not sure if it was a commercial or military jet.  The jet was laying out quite a good con-trail, (that's what caught my attention.) The jet was traveling from east to west/southwest.  Then I noticed the object. It appeared to be at the approximate same altitude as the jet, and perhaps within a quarter of a mile from the jet. Its relative position to the jet was rearward and to the left, (from my perspective). I brought it to the attention of the other two people with me.  It appeared to be stationary. It was round in shape, metallic. It was very silvery and shiny. It remained stationary, and then after a short time, it began to pace the aircraft.  But, the jet slowly gained distance, as the UFO was traveling at a slower speed.  It remained off to one side and rearward of the aircraft as it moved.  I had enough time to gain access to my garage and retrieve a pair of binoculars.  I observed the object through binoculars for perhaps 30 seconds. It was definately round, perhaps \"ball-like\".  I was able to definately observe that there were no wings or other protrusions.   On what would appear to be the bottom were two lights.  One was large and white and very bright.  I mean very bright! The other was much smaller and red.  The shape was very discernable through the binoculars, and WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR JET!,  It was round.  It could have been a disc, but it really seemed to be ball-like orb...at least from my viewing position.  Total time viewed was at least two minutes.  Then it was no longer in sight.  I cannot describe its departure.  We could just no longer find it in the sky.",

(This account can be seen on the WTVM Channel 9 Columbus, Georgia website)  The \"search\" was joined by \"personnel from Fort Benning, Georgia, the Georgia State Patrol and several \"unidentified\" personnel\"   According to the officals, \"...after searching for over 5 hours (including the use of helicopters) NOTHING was found\".   In addition, the fire chief made a statement to a local news crew (on film) that...\"sometimes people see what they think is something and it really is nothing....\"   Several large tractor trailers were seen going into the area which had been contained by police.  According to the local press, the witnesses (which are suppose to have been \"interviewed\" by the local Police on Wednesday the next day) all stated that something \"crashed\" and it appeared to be a bring, shiny object travelling at high speed.   Interestingly, the police, fire and FAA offical stated on the next day that \"neither the local Columbus Metropolitan Airport or Fort Benning Lawson Army Airfield radar had shown NO sign of ANY craft or object on radar at the supposed time of impact.  BUT I spoke to the head weather reporter for a local TV station who told me that his station has thier OWN RADAR and they showed \"something\" striking the area at the approximate time given.   Further, I and another professional educator (with both hold Phd's) were travelling next to the Columbus Metro Airport at approximately 1:00 PM on Weds (the next day)   NOTE: THE Airport is LESS than 3 miles from the supposed crash site when both I and the other professor saw a COMPLETELY UNMARKED, White, 727 Jet land at the Columbus Airport.    As the plane taxied by us (we were NO more than 100 feet from the! plane which was slightly above us at an angle moving towards the main compound) my companions vehicle, lost all power, all gauges went dead, power steering, engine, everything and we guilded to a stop.  We both existed the vehicle thinking something mechanically major had gone wrong with his vehicle.   At that moment the plane began to slowly pass us as it was taxing from the main runway.  I picked up my cell phone to call a mechanic and found my cell phone to be dead.  My companions cell phone was also dead.  We both watched the plane as it went by us.  Both of us are veterans and have travelled MANY times on 727's.   Almost at the same moment, we both spoke because we noticed that the plane had NO MARKINGS OF ANY KIND...no tail numbers, nothing.  The plane had a strange finish and almost looked (excuse the obvious pun) whitewashed.   When the plane got approximately 100 feet FROM us, my companions car RESTARTED with no apparent reason, or damage of any kind.   In addition, both my and my companions cell phone came back on.   We are both academic professors and are empiricists.  We have NEVER been involved in ANY such thing before.   I immediatally attempted to call the airport to inquire about the plane. I was connected (I dont know why to this number) the fire/police crash station.  I started to ask the man who answered about the plane.     He ruded cut me off and stated, \"that is a private plane, thank you\" and hung up.   Approximately 30 minutes later I arrived home and I decided to try and call the local aviation company which sells fuel and such and is next to the main terminal.   I called CSG Aviation.  I young woman answered and I inquired about the plane.  She was obviously very young and most likely, simple desk help.  I asked about the 727 \"private plane\" at which time she CORRECTED ME and told me \"Oh no, that was a GOVERNMENT PLANE\"  I asked how she knew that and she said that \"It had picked up SOMETHING which it loaded into its rear section and it also refueled, a man in a coat and tie came from the plane and PAID for the fuel with a credit card which had US Treasury and an account number on it.\"  She said thats how she knew it was a \"government plane\".   An additional call to the Airport admin office confused me further.  At that time I was now told that, \" I was mistaken, that NO PLANE, much less a 727, had landed or taken off during the time period I gave\".   When my wife got home, I told her of my encounter and SHE INFORMED ME about the \"crash\" the say before.   I had not been feeling well and  had not read the paper or seen the news.   Needless to say, this revelation absoluted stunned me.   I am trying to get the \"witnesses statements\" from the police.  I FIRMLY believe that SOMETHING WAS FOUND AND RECOVERED and that it was taken from Columbus the next day in the STRANGE and unexplained \"ghost plane\" my friend and I saw.   We have a huge military base here with its own airport.  Logic states that if this was something military, they would of taken it to Fort Benning.   I was also told that during the same period that \"debris\" was reported striking areas around Montgomery, Alabama which is appoximately 100 miles from here.   I have NEVER been involved or even interested in anything like this but circumstances has changed that. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the source of this report, and he impressed us with his sincerity, and with the volume of information he had collected about the incident.  He asserts that members of the Georgia State Police, the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, members of the military, and employees of the FAA were on site, at the time that the area was closed off.  We have requested that he provide more information about the incident, and that he have the other witness to the 727 landing also submit a report of his recollection of the event.  PD))",

I looked at it to see what airplane company it was because of its low flying; about 50000 ft. It was shiny reflecting the sun from the top, no wings, round in shap with no noise.  It was a pretty big craft, almost the size of the DC9 at 13000ft.  I watched it till it sped off quickly into the clouds that were off in the distance to the west.",

      "story": "First time for everything ! At approx 2045 hours I looked out of our second floor bathroom window to check the weather . Brought to my immediate attention was a very bright (brighter than a KC-10 landing light seen at one half mile distance) , very large (larger than a seedless grape viewed at arms length) , object which was shaped in the form of a child's \"top\" . The object was spatially stationary (I fixed its position relative to two near tree branches.) , although it was rotating counter-clockwise at (best guess) about one RPM . It's color was \"opalescent\" white ; there was a small red , eccentrically located red light near the upper portion which rotated as if fixed to the object . As a \"best guess\" , I'd estimate the object to be about two or two and one half miles distant , the direction being to the N.N.W. . As for atmospheric conditions , the sky was overcast with a ceiling of about 3k feet . The object appeared to be approx 1.5 to 2.0 k feet above ground level . I watched the object (with fascination !) for about three minutes , after which I left the bathroom so as to procure a camera . When I returned , the object was no longer viable . I continued to observe the area for about two minutes , at which point I noted two slow moving \"conventional\" aircraft circling the area where the unidentifiable object had been sighted . These \"conventional\" aircraft were circling in a 360 degree \"holding pattern\" , about 500 feet above and roughly a half mile beyond the diameter of the unidentified craft . Although I could ascertain no distinct shape of the two circling smaller aircraft , I assumed them to be helicopters (nav lights , and air speed too slow for fixed-wing) from McGuire A.F.B.  I watched the circling aircraft for an additional five minutes or so , and retired for the night . I awoke at approx 0400 , and immediately (even before coffee !) checked the television news programing for additional details about the very strange object - There was none . The network news did (at about 0920) , however , make mention that some people in Arizona had become alarmed after viewing a U.S.A.F. weather balloon . Why did I wait so long to report such a strange object , when its size surly must have attracted the attention of very many people ? Although I'd never witnessed such a thing before , I suppose that the answer would have roots related to both a sense of frustration/disappointment and the potential risk of loss of credibility . If you've \"stayed with me this far\" , I'll seize the opportunity to note that I've been an aerophile (an airplane \"affectation\")for over fifty years , that I'm a former member of the United States Parachuting Association , and that I'm an armature (very)astronomer . In closing , although the experience only lasted for about three minutes , it was quite a show ! I thank you for your kind attention . Sincerely , ((name and specialty deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

At the time, I did not link the two because they had reported it as a \"plane\".  I did some private investigating into this UFO crash after finding out that it wasn't a plane about 6 months after it happened.   I'm really sorry to the readers that I didn't submit my report sooner and didn't get any pictures of the acorn shaped object, but I've met up with a key witness and I do believe I've located the crash site. The key witness saw the metallic object in the air and then saw it crash.  He thought it was a plane crashing even though he didn't see any wings.  There is a crater about 40 feet wide there at the crash site.",

While observing the moon over McGuire AFB to the east something caught the corner of my eye kind of overhead at 90 degrees. As I looked up I observed 2 oval shaped objects about half the length of a commercial airliner. The objects appeared silvery almost liquid silver. They were approximatley 1/2 half a mile from each other moving from west to east - towards the Ft.Dix / Mcguire AFB location. These objects moved at a high rate of speed at least 8-10 times faster than any commercial or military craft that I have seen in my lifetime. As they traveled parallel to each other towards the military installations I observed each one of them simultaneously split into 2 craft making now a total of 4. This must be about 10-13 seconds into the observation at this point they were approximatley over or very near the bases now and I observed all 4 of the objects turn abruptly to the north and immediately vanish. As I stood there looking around to see if someone else was around that maybe saw this I took my cell phone out to call my wife and tell her of this extraordinary incident, I looked to the sky where this began and there was a single one flying even faster than the first ones. I had the cell phone inmy hand ,hit the camera button on the side aimed as quickly as I could hoping to capture this on my phone. I was gone in 5 -10 seconds. Not a sound at all was heard from this. What is even more odd is the air traffic during this time and even 5 mins afterwards was non-existant. I am dumfounded by this and hope that I read about someone else that maybe saw these things.",

Hmmmm they were not there before ???    If you take a \"/\" one star at each tip perhaps one \"inch\" apart if you had a ruler at arms length.  I pointed to them and my wife acknowledged them with ooo's and ahh's.  I looked back at the band and perhaps a minute later looked back at them.  They were still in the same area but only 3/4s as bright.  I thought this odd and again pointed to them.  Then as we were both looking at them we commented \"There moving and fading\"  The movement seemed UP but again - using a ruler they probably moved 4 inches until the \"stars\" grew slammer and dimmer.  My first thought was ISS with the Shuttle near by????   It was as bright as a month ago with ISS/Shuttle attached flew over.  I was sure it must be that.  We both have lived around airports all of our lives, we both agree there is no way they were aircraft.    The gap remained constant between the \"stars\" has they faded and shrank.  Yet - upon investigation there were no satellites in the sky that night near us.  There were no tell tale colored lights from aircraft.  Perhaps F18 or F16 from Truax?  But we both do not think so.  Not afterburners as the color was white!  Not landing lights because the objects were coming towards us (west to east) and did not \"blink\" off.

As it changed shape, the red lights didn't move but the other light moved from their position from the sides to the direct top and bottom!

I now know the time I seen this luminous blue Orb cloud, at exactly at the time the Aircraft crashed in Buffalo NY. 110 degree s heading from my position IS directly lined up with Buffalo NY. What I believe is that I seen a Weaponized Cloud that released an Energy Drain Beam at the area and that Aircraft that cashed and killed all on board, including Beverly Eckert of the 911 Truth investigations. Also had a friend in that area, but in Ohio, located at 110 degrees from my position that commented she was very tired last night, all of a sudden\u2026went to bed early!  She did not see anything as she did not go outside. Now, I have conducted many, many Weapons systems hidden by the gov.

While outside I noticed 3 super stallion military helicopters fly over heading east.  After the helicopters left my field of sight I noticed a small light slowly moving north.  It appeared to be a shiny metallic and was reflecting the sunlight off of it.  As I watched the object it suddenly stopped.  After sitting still in the sky for approximately 1 minute, the object headed west at the same slow pace.  I noticed that the object was not only reflecting the sunlight but it was also appearing to be slowly pulsing a white light.  The object abruptly stopped again for about 3o seconds to 1 minute and continued on the same path.  I did have my video recorder with me and tried to get video of the object.  I could not get any solid video of the object moving because the sun prohibited me from observing the object through my LCD screen. Later that evening I did review the video and I did manage to capture several small bits of video showing the object.  I did obtain some still pictures of the object and one picture clearly shows a small metallic orb in the sky.  It seemed to have some sort of haze (energy?)surrounding it.",

I tried to get closer, but as I got closer they started to fly further and further away. I had my video camera with me and I tried my hardest to at least get some video, but I could not. I drove after them but I lost them. About 15 minutes, I saw a single light pulsating like crazy. I pulled out my camcorder that was turned on, but it some how turned off by itself so I had to turn it back on. As I drove toward that UFO, it flew away as well.

Date: 09OCT2010 Time: 20:15 EDT Location: Columbus, Georgia. 31909 Account as it happened. While driving South on I185 at the exit on Georgia Hwy 80W to Phenix City, Alabama my wife and I had noticed several orange lights in the sky that sort of resembled the little dipper in an inverted position at about a 10:00 position in the night sky. As we exited the Interstate and on to Ga. Hwy 80W we watched the lights stay in the same position or a holding pattern and the lights which numbered at least 12 or more slowly go out one by one in no special order. We were slowed down on the divided highway because of other vehicles on the roadway that were also observing this unexplained sighting. Vehicles were on the shoulder on the West bound side and a car in the median and exit ramp on the East bound side at Bradley Park East exit. Ft Benning, Georgia is South of Columbus, Georgia. I served 10 years in the military and in combat and can say that this was not helicopters, aircraft, night fire training flares or fireworks. The objects in the numbers we saw would no way be any type of aircraft that could hold that position or that close of a pattern and then slowly go out. The only time I saw any aircraft not using marker lights was in a combat theater and there is not any combat operations happening in Columbus, Georgia that would result in aircraft having marker lights on and then turned off slowly. This ordeal lasted roughly 5-6 minutes from our account. We have never encountered anything like this ever in our lives or seen anything quite like it. End of statement.",

      "story": "Football field sized gunmetal gray rectangular craft with bright lights and \"windows\" hovering silently 100 ft or so above parking lot It was 1984 or 1985 (I\u2019m very bad with dates) and I was living with my ex-fiance on the north side of Columbus, Ohio.. We had planned to take a short trip across town to visit my mother that evening, and our only vehicle at the time was his motorcycle. As we mounted the bike in the driveway we looked up and in the distance saw three blinding white lights. They weren't far from the ground; two below and one above in a tight triangle configuration. My fiance was in the Air Force at the time and worked at Wright Paterson on the weekends. \"What the Hell is that?\" he wondered aloud. \"It's probably just highbeams on a crane\" I suggested. We would know soon enough since we had to head in that direction.  We drove for about a mile, all the while my ex was saying \"What the Hell is that??\" Eventually we came close enough to be able to tell that it was too high up to be lights attached to a crane, but they were dead still. Suddenly we noticed that a large rectangular space behind the lights was far darker than the sky around it. My ex yelled \"WHAT THE FUCK IS IT??!  Then slammed on his brakes as about six African American kids ranging in age from about ten to sixteen dashed in front of our bike. Their eyes were also fixed on the monstrous craft. And it was bloody huge. Not \"Independence day\" huge-but easily as large as a football field or larger. It was gunmetal gray; like a giant monolithic slab  about the proportions of a thick cereal box or box of cigarettes with slightly raised and depressed geometric shapes of various sizes on it's surface (it was not smooth at all). It hovered over a large empty parking lot that stretched out in front of an abandoned Rink's department stor! e. The road we were on was busy, but I didn't notice if others had stopped to look. The craft had the three painfully bright lights mounted on what looked like it's front. There were smaller amber/ red and bluish green lights underneath it that glowed steadily, and as we kept driving we came around to the \"back\" of the craft, which featured three (maybe four) flat, glowing rectangular panels in a horizontal row that were tilted slightly downward. They looked like large observation windows to me, and I felt-or perhaps even saw-figures moving around inside. I didn\u2019t want to see anymore and looked down. My former fiance finally said \"We have to get closer!\" and I completely flipped out -and I'm not one who is given to \"flipping out\". He turned the bike toward the craft and I hit him hard and told him that there was no way in hell that he would take me any closer. I was in tears I was so frightened. Just as this was happening the group of boys that had crossed in front of us co! uld be seen running across the expanse of the parking lot towa! rd the a rea under the craft. As they neared it I glanced down for a second time, not wanting to see what was happening,  and as I did I heard my ex exclaim \"Holy Fuck!!\" I looked and the kids were standing there, but the craft had disappeared. Ken said that it had shot straight up into the sky at a speed that was simply unbelievable. I begged him to keep driving and we continued on.

My friend was giving me a ride home from his house.  As we got closer to my home, I noticed an unusually bright star.  We continued driving, but then out of nowhere, my friend and I noticed at the same time, that the star was no star.  The light we saw grew even more intense and then disappeared just as fast.  We herd absolutely no sounds what so ever.  We then pulled into a parking lot and continued to watch.  The craft was hovering very close to Ft. Benning.  As we got out of the car, I flashed a flashlight in the direction of the light; it disappeared very quickly, but with a small delay. Thinking it was over, again out of nowhere, no other sounds or lights; the craft instantly appeared less than a mile away, just a couple hundred feet up.  I saw a disturbing sight.  The light was being emitted from the bottom of a craft.  The bottom of the craft was smooth a! nd flat, but tapered to a blunt top, similar to a spinning top.  On the side of the craft, there was a reddish light.  It was sweeping in a clockwise rotation, if viewed from directly underneath the craft.  The red sweeping light never made a full 360 degree swoop around the craft.  It maintained this close distance for less than a minute, and then disappeared again, just as quick.  As the sun was rising, it kept its position in the sky, and would blink as the bottom craft light grew and dimmed in intensity.  We managed to capture a one minute video of it blinking and changing intensity.  And eventually we lost sighting at about 7:30am the same morning.  Again, this just occurred an hour ago and for the amount of time it stayed visible, I\u2019m very sure that my friend and I weren\u2019t the only ones to see it!

After stepping out of Fairoaks Mall in Columbus, IN around 7:00 p.m. I noticed what I first thought was a BLIMP, only MILES higher than any blimp I've ever seen before. I began to watch it as it traveled across the sky very slowly.  It was low for a jet or commercial plane, but still much higher than any blimp you would normally see.  I began to think maybe it was a weather balloon of some type, but eventually decided that since it was traveling on such a direct path that it must be some sort of vehicle with an engine.  I was first surprised by the fact of a blimp so high in the air at first, but what really surprised me was what happened after it had traveled halfway across the sky.  It was traveling at the same speed, never stopped or slowed or sped up, yet when it had traveled roughly halfway across the horizon it spat out a huge chunk of white \"smoke\".  Then about 3-5 seconds later it spit out another hunk of what I thought was smoke.  Now there were 2 dashes ! of smoke across the sky coming from what I thought was a blimp.  My second witness also witnessed these puffs of smoke.  However, seconds after these two puffs were spat out, it began to emit a CONSTANT trail of this smoke like substance, just like your typical Chemtrail (or Contrail, I suppose).  After traveling at the same speed completely across the horizon, this Blimp (which looked like a cigar covered in Aluminum foil) just SUDDENLY, out of nowhere without changing a thing in trajectory, speed, or altitude, began to omit a chemtrail. It literally looked like a giant crop-dusting blimp, miles in the air.  The thought of it made us feel extremely eerie and upset for the remainder of the day.",

It was the fourth of July and there were many fireworks in the area.  We were driving west.   As we turned south toward our neighborhood, I noticed a red and orange fireball just above the trees to the west.   It seemed to have a red center with a orange misty glow around it.  It was about the height of a street light and from our point of view, the outer glow looked like the size of a basketball.  It was difficult to tell if the \"glow\" was part of object or due to viewing it through the windshield. I traveled a block south and turned west on a street toward our neighborhood.   I turned a street earlier than I usually do to get a better look at the object.  When I came to the next intersection, 1/2 block distance, we saw the object above a house to the south.  We turned south.  I told my 11 year old son to keep an eye on it as I drove.   I traveled the length of two more blocks (still going south)  and then turned west again.  The object was now above the houses on the south side of the west bound street.  We drove two blocks to our house.  I pulled into the driveway.  My husband was in the yard with the kids.  I jumped out of the car and pointed it out to my husband.  It was south of our house in the sky at about a 45 degree angle and getting small but still too bright to be a star - and it was orange red.   We  watched it get smaller assuming it was getting further away.   It took several minutes before it disappeared. I went inside and the family continued to shoot  fireworks.  I would estimate I was in the house ten minutes when my  son came in and said \"Dad needs you.\"   When I asked why, my son said, \"The orange light is back\".   Sure enough.  In the same spot it disappeared it appeared again  It looked like a very bright orange star.  I watched it for several minutes then came inside.  My husband reported it moved slightly to the west and then grew small and disappeared again. What drew our attention to the object was the  fourth of July fireworks in our area.   As we were driving home and nearing our neighborhood, we were watching the fireworks.   A large firework in that area lit off but this orange ball didn't move.   We expected it to explode and it didn't.   At first I thought it was a street light on fire or a fire in the trees.   Then as it floated above the houses, I wondered if it were a parachute type firework that was on fire and I was concerned about where it was going to land. When we first saw it, it was floating about the height of the street light and below the trees.  It climbed to float above a one story house.  Soon it was above the larger two story houses and when we finally saw it in the distance it seemed to be very high in the sky. We zigzagged in a south and west pattern to our home.  The object seemed to move south - southwest.  My vehicle was moving slowly at a 15 mph estimated speed.  The object moved ahead of us and I would assume it moved a quicker speed than our vehicle,  but not much given that it dissected our route.",

      "story": "Possible UFO's over Columbus Ohio October 29th This is the night of the Ohio State Wisconsin Football Game in the Ohio State Stadium on campus.  There is a small bridge north of the stadium, where after the game everyone walks in large crowds back to their cars, or to tailgates that are still going on. At about 11:45 I was walking back to meet up with my three cousins (who are brothers) who went to the game, because they were my ride home. On the bridge, about halfway, three round glowing lights in a perfect triangle formation came flying from the west very fast. I was walking slow in the crowd of people looking at these things honestly thinking that they were jets because of their formation. Once they got about parallel to the bridge they STOPPED.  They were close, like three times as close as a typical plane. They were very bright and clear, and literally looked like fireballs.  Orangish red, and almost pulsating like they were some sort of aircraft or something. there was no shape to them though, just br! ight lights.  Right when they stopped, i stopped walking and started asking people around me what these things were.  About 5 or 6 people stopped next to me and we started talking and looking at these 3 things in this hovering triangular formation. Ive never seen anything like this, and i am usually the type of person to make fun of people who say they saw UFO's, or religious signs.  Anyway this gets even stranger. Almost a minute of me (and now about 15 or so people around me) staring at these things, the one closest to us MOVES INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE OTHER TWO.  All these UFO cases you hear people saying that these aircrafts do impossible maneuvers or something that makes no sense.  We saw this thing just perfectly glide in between the other two, forming a PERFECT FREAKING LINE.  This was after one of the biggest games of the college football season, so MANY people were drunk, i was not though, because i had to drive home.  The people around me i could tell weren't either becaus! e we were all talking going what in the hell is going on? I ha! ve to te ll you i was on absolutely no drugs nor under the influence, because after the objects form into a line, we all start yelling because there is a FOURTH ONE coming from the west (the same direction the original three came from). This fourth one is flying. It was going so fast, almost looked like a missle or something. It was exactly the same as the other three though. This thing comes near the three that are in a line, and stops right near them. Yes, it STOPPED. It makes NO SENSE AT ALL how anything in the air can stop after going so fast. After it stopped the first three literally freaking SHOOT towards the south. I dont want to say disappear, but these things went from just being stationary to going very fast. in about 5 seconds they were to the point where we could not see them because they were now so far away. However, the fourth one that came up, stayed stationary for about 5 more seconds, and it slowly started to move to the south. We all watched this one go off for ab! out a minute into the distance, much much slower than the other three. I was standing there (and still am) trying to figure out what in the hell this was. My first guess is that it has something to do with the game, but that doesnt make any sense because THIS WAS AN AIRCRAFT, or some type of object. I want someone to tell me that it is something that i can look up and then confirm that its not a UFO, but nobody can. And this was a a pretty long sequence, about 4 minutes. Literally, like 20 people around me on this bridge one this fourth object was flying in were all talking to each other trying to figure out what was going on. I found a number of videos online that show similar looking things in the sky. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woCXh2kaw78&list=PL5AA853A833B2D26B&index=16&feature=plpp_video This one shows exactly what they looked like, even though the ones in this video dont show the same maneuvering characteristics. I have no idea if this video is real or fake, all im saying is that what i saw looked exactly like this. Please, if someone has any idea of what these things could have been besides some type of aircraft that doesn't belong to earth, please tell me because its one of those things that if it actually was just mistaken for something, i really want to know. Also if you read this and you were on campus that night and saw this too, please please let me know",

But, after a short time, it still did not seem to move.  The all of a sudden, it quickly darted to the south, and then quickly disappeared from sight.  The several lights were very close together, which I thougt would be part of one craft.

I have a 20 min commute I from the center of town to the north end of the outer-belt (I-270) where I stay at.  The night was fairly clear, but I can't see too many stars due to light pollution.  I am in the city (obviously) but my street has no lighting what so ever.  Its kinda isolated which is why we chose to live here.  I was coming East down my street (approx. a 1/4 mi of no lights / straight shot to a T intersection) and saw an orange glow in the sky.  I would guess that from the horizon it was up approx. 30-40 degrees in the air, and was an orange ball.  I think it was between 2-7 mi away in distance from me.    I saw it traveling from at least north to south, if not NW to SE (which is my better guess but not 100% sure).  I THOUGHT I might have see 1 flashing light happen as if it were an airplane, but this thing was going at a pretty decent pace.   The only thing I can think of that would go at its speed from that low would be a helicopter, but there was no sound, and I don't get much air traffic over my house from Port Columbus Int'l.  Too fast for a smaller aircraft, and definitely not an airliner.  I saw it travel, then I drove up by a tree and lost sight of it because of the tree, and then it was gone.  I looked outside for 10 min not find it.   The orange color was about the same tint as the orange in highway lights that make everything gray. I don't think it was jupiter (or any other planet) due to the movement and that I lost sight of it.  But I'm not ruling out the thought.  Maybe someone knows where certain planets are at this time of year and specifically for that date.   I don't know of any aircraft that have that orange tint to their headlights.  I've seen the normal white, and recently saw an airplane w/ LED (like the obnoxious head lights that pure white).

      "story": "Orange Glowing Orb or Fireball seen over Columbus OH, (North OSU Campus) Observation: Myself and a close friend were walking South in an alley between 18th and 17th Street, OSU Campus.  We saw two objects in the sky to the South-East of our location.  The objects appeared to be orange lights.  They were travelling away from us (S.E.) at approx. 1000 feet above ground, and approx. 100-150 mph.  The 2 objects travelled in the same direction, in a straight line formation.  The second trailed the other by 100-200 feet.  At this point they were quite far off, such that we did not get a detailed look at them.  The objects left our field of vision in the distance to the South-East of us.  Then about 10-15 seconds later we observed what appeared to be the same orange objects, however this time the objects were to the North-East of us, travelling South-East.  They were much closer this time, passing our longitude at a few hundred feet to the North of our location.  At this point we observed the objects in greater detail.  Both objects were travelling in the same trajectory as previously observed, with the same approx. altitude and velocity, travelling the same approx. distance apart.  Their speed, altitude, and trajectory remained constant.  The orange objects, now at a much closer distance to our position, appeared to be comprised of two sections, upper and lower.  The upper section of the object appeared to be spherical in shape, with a light emitting a \u2018glowing\u2019 effect, rather than a \u2018shining\u2019 effect.  The lower section was a shining orange light, and appeared to be swaying back and forth in relation to the upper part.  These observed qualities led us to thi! nk that these were balloons, with a glowing globe, and an under-basket emitting a orange flame which illuminated the upper globe portion. \t However a few questions remain unanswered.  One, the objects appeared to be about the size of a small 4-person propeller plane.  The orange globe appeared to be too similar in size to the orange light underneath for it to be the parachute of a balloon.  Two, the objects travelled at a velocity much faster than a typical balloon.  Three, how did the two objects move so quickly from the SE of us to the NE of us in a matter of seconds, or were there in fact 4 glowing objects in the sky?  About the Observers: I am a 22 year old Music Instructor, recently graduated from Under-grad. My friend is 23 years old, on break from school, working as a restaurant server.  We are house-mates and close friends. We both observed the same objects, agreeing on the physical characteristics, and details of the event, to the best of our knowledge.  Neither of us were able to identify these objects, although our closest guess was some sort of balloon.  We were intrigued by them and looked online with the intent to find some explanation of what they were.  In our search we stumbled upon this reporting site and decided to write a report.

I'm sure that these were ufo's because of the amount of other air crafts that were in the air soon after.   Also there is a military air force base & a loca! l airport here, as well as an industrial park where helicopters, drones, and other aircraft vehicles are manufactured, and being well versed on what type of air crafts are being manufactured in those buildings,  I can bare witness that what I saw did not match any aircraft or object being manufactured in any of these locations.

One was clearly in the lead, the other three lights moved behind at some distance. They appeared to be moving directly over the flight path for the Columbus (CMH) airport's approach, however, they stayed at the same height.  As the moved across the sky, the three that trailed the leader moved in different formations.  At first they had no distinct pattern.  Then they drifted to align in a straght line eventually forming a near perfect triangle. Winds were from the west at 5 miles per hour, these were traversing the sky at a much faster rate - totally silent, not quite the speed of the many jets I see and hear taking off and landing each day. The lights did not flash or flicker, akin to the &quot;chinese lantern&quot; effect I've seen described in other reports.  Quite bright, as if drifting across the sky (except for the various formations of the trailing three) until they faded into a hazy cloud layer. I called the police, the dispatcher had no other reports of the sighting roughly ten minutes later.  The lights left no trail but were very unique. I'm a fairly sane individual who enjoys watching the skies for meteors and space station sightings and can name several of the galaxies formations and objects upon sight.  This was unlike any of those.  They did not reflect, but produced their own light in a shade similar to sodium street lights with a bit more red, somewhat pinkish tint. Within a few minutes, I could hear a jet approaching the airport. It was a quiet evening for this part of town.",

We waited and watched the sky and pretty soon(within 5 minutes) the object appeared again in the East and traveled west towards us, turned north and then was gone again and it did not return.

My wife, her friend and I were outside smoking a cigarette at around 10:50 P.M. when I noticed three glowing orbs moving north to south overhead. We went to the front yard to watch them, and discovered that there were actually four, one having passed the house moments earlier. They were roughly circular, but obviously spherical, like a jellyfish lit from within by an orange/reddish light. My immediate thought was that they were paper lanterns, but as we watched for even two more seconds, several things became apparent. Firstly, despite the lack of any noticeable wind at ground level, all four of the objects were moving at an eerily fast rate: they had each passed over the street facing our house and were at least a quarter mile away less than twenty seconds later. Secondly, each object, while grouped relatively close, moved at variable speeds and transcribed smooth arcs and lateral movements that brought them within feet of one another at times (excepting the fourth, which was the first to pass overhead). The glowing objects appeared to dim and wink out as they moved to the middle distance: the entire encounter having lasted no longer than two minutes. Our house is less than two miles from the Columbus airport, and at least one often-used flight plan brings aircraft directly over our house every twenty minutes or so, but these lights could in no way be associated with any airplane that I have seen.",

On this occasion, I went outside to lock my car and the object caught my eye.   It was moving from east northeast to west southwest.   It was not falling like a shooting star, but moving horizontally.  Unlike the first sighting, this one had no trailing \u201ccone\u201d shape behind it, but otherwise it was identical.   It produced no trail, like a shooting star or comet.   It moved in a straight line fairly quickly, like the speed you would of a plane flying across the sky.   But I have seen planes flying across the night sky with their navigation lights flashing at regular intervals.  This was definitely not a plane.  The object was basically round and orange in color, but it shimmered or flashed but not regularly \u2013 the effect was more like it was an irregular shaped object spinning around fairly quickly.   Maybe it would be akin to wrapping aluminum foil around a rock, hang from a string, spin it around, and shine a bright orange light on it.   Anyway, it tracked across the sky and then it gradually diminished in intensity and eventually faded from view.   The whole episode lasted about  10-15 seconds from the time I first spotted it.",

      "story": "bright white cigar/cylinder above columbus OH  4/03/2012  daytime sighting Tuesday April 3rd 2012. I was outside on a break at work, it was about 7:15pm.  Weather was perfect, bright blue sky with hardly a cloud to be seen.  Upon exiting the building I looked to the sky, as I usually do (I\u2019m fascinated with looking up, watching airplanes, looking at stars etc.) I noticed two planes very high heading west, one behind the other and a little offset.  I watched for a few seconds and turned my attention to my phone to do a bit of web surfing.  After a couple of minutes I again looked toward the sky, but this time I was in for a surprise! When I looked up, I saw something I can\u2019t explain.  There was a bright white object. The shape was somewhere between a cigar and a cylinder.  Actually, it looked like a pill capsule.  Take the fuselage of a plane, remove the wings and tail and cap both ends with a dome.  That\u2019s what I saw. I was on the east side of Columbus, OH and fairly close to the airport. Keep in mind, it was broad daylight when this occurred.  The \u201cobject\u201d was traveling from south to north in much the same way a blimp might travel. (silently gliding across the sky)  The altitude was really not that high, I\u2019m guessing around 5\u2019000 ft. It was low enough to see that it did not have wings, and that it was not a blimp, but it was just a little too high to see any clear detail. (as in windows , doors etc.) A pair of cheap binoculars would have revealed something I\u2019m sure.  That\u2019s how close it was. I watched the object pass over as it headed north.  I\u2019m guessing it was about a half mile east of my position. Hard to tell though because I don\u2019t know the true size of said object.  From my perspective I\u2019d say the size was somewhere between a private jet, and a commercial airliner.  The moment was very surreal. I just watched in amazement. I did think about taking a picture with my phone, but I knew the picture would only reveal a small white blob in the sky, and wouldn\u2019t prove anything\u2026 I would be made fun of by friends when trying to show it. In hindsight however, I wish I had taken that picture!  The object continued heading away from me to the north, and after I had my fill of watching it, I again returned to surfing the web. (I knew I had just witnessed something extraordinary, but there was nothing else to see)  After reading a couple articles in the news I decided it was time to go back inside. I took one more look to the sky, and low and behold, there it was again! It seemed to be on the same trajectory, only this time, it was headed back to where it came. (south) I couldn\u2019t believe it. I watched for a few seconds and decided I needed a witness. I went back inside, and yelled for one of my co-workers. I told him to hurry, you\u2019ve gotta see this. We were back outside in about 15 sec. I pointed to the sky and said \u201cWhat the **** is that?!!\u201d  He was without words. I had him confirm what I saw.  Me:  \u201cdo you see wings?\u201d   Him: \u201cno\u201d   Me: \u201cis it a blimp?\u201d Him: \u201cno\u201d  Me: \u201cwhat do you think it is?\u201d  Him: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d We watched it head further to the south for maybe 30-40 sec. and then it changed course a bit and headed roughly south east and then accelerated (gradually, but firmly) off into the distance. Im very glad I called for him. I have no idea what I witnessed. I very much like looking to the sky, and I do every time I go outside. I live in the flight path of Port Columbus and I am accustomed to seeing different types of planes as they come in to land. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m no aviation expert, but like I said I\u2019ve always been fascinated by flight, and I watch planes every chance I get. I love to read about the mysteries of this earth, and in doing so, I have read enough to also be a very skeptical person. However, this is one thing I cannot explain.  To me this was truly an Unidentified Flying Object. From where it came, I do not know, but I am very glad to have witnessed it. I have searched online every day since and have come up with nothing. Surely somebody saw it, and I would like to hear other accounts.",

My brother and I were crossing a field on our way home in the winter of 1958.  ((sic.  1955-1957.  Please see addendum below.))  There was a thin layer of low clouds that night.   Something in the sky caught our attention.  We looked up and saw about 5 lights above the cloud layer in a \"V\" shape flying south to north.  I thought they must have been military aircraft flying exceptionally high since we could not hear any noise, but the lights seemed to be just above the cloud layer.   We could see the glow of the lights through the cloud layer.  They were all white lights.  I thought it was probably military aircraft for about 55 years until I recently watched a UFO program on one of the cable channels.  They showed a few amateur photos and artist's renditions of what many people have seen in central Ohio for years.   What we saw that night was similar to what many folks in Ohio reportedly have been seeing for many years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in 1958 is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I would like to add an addendum to my last report.  After I sent the last report, I thought hard about the sighting.  I concluded that we saw the lights between 1955-1957.  Also, there could have been 7 lights shaped in a \"V\" or just 5 lights.  I also remember thinking it was one of the air force's old flying-wing aircraft.  But I was really puzzled that it made absolutely no sound.  If it was an air force aircraft, the lights were low enough that it should have definitely made an noise.  ((END ADDENDUM))",

I walked outside of the porch and after looking around the house and only finding a slow moving truck cruising down the street I headed back to the porch.  The sky is very clear tonight and the temperature is nice so I was stargazing. In the southwestern sky I saw three bright white lights very brightly flickering.  Immediately I called for my mother and she quickly joined me in viewing these lights.  They were arranged in a triangular pattern with one of the lights pointed in the direction of north and the two others being relatively close together in the rear.   I then noticed that they were moving very quickly in straight lines.  The movement was far to fast to be an aircraft as it was immediate.  It appeared that the lights were defining the edge line of the craft.  It was completely silent and moved at the speed of a typical jet.  It was traveling south*west to north. As it moved another light appeared and the size of the craft was plain to distinguish from the rest of the sky.  However, the object was exactly the same color as the night sky. It was like a perfect reflection; it was as if it was invisible.  As I watched it move and watched the lights move back and worth I could see that it appeared like a gian! t rectangular panel.  The size of the craft was massive. It was only possible to know that the lights belonged to only one craft because as it moved it blotted out stars in the area between the lights.  It continued north (towards Wright Patterson AFB) and as it went further from my location it was possible to hear the sound of its engine.  It was the sound of a jet engine.  This was comforting, as it allowed me to have no fear that this craft was anything otherworldly. My mother and I are medical professionals.",

On Saturday, November 17th,  we had just dropped our son off to his third shift job at a mall when my wife remembered she left some things at her work, which is just across the street from where our son works nights.  We drove into the parking lot and I waited while she ran inside. Looking straight east I noticed the planet Jupiter bright in the eastern sky.  It was a clear night and cool. Just a little to the Northeast of Jupiter I noticed a small flashing light that just looked funny.  So I grabbed a pair of my binoculars that I keep in my van to get a better look.  Through the binocs I saw a huge white light with a red blue light on surrounding the bottom.  I thought it might be a prism effect of the binoculars when my wife came out of the building and asked what I was looking at. I pointed the light out.  She was looking with her naked eye and I through the binocs when suddenly the object split in half.  My wife commented, &quot;did you just see the light split! &quot;?  She saw with her naked eye.  The object moved quickly apart, with the brighter part moving away from the red blue lighted half.  We watched for a few more minutes and then headed home keeping the separated object in view.  When we got home we quickly looked east again with binoculars just in time to see the object merge back together. Amazing sight to be sure.  I would guess the object was huge and at a great distance because of lack of detail.   As a closing thought, later that morning when I picked up my son from work at 6 AM Sunday morning, the object was gone and have not seen it in the sky since.",

      "story": "Columbus Ohio area- orange and white lights I'm a 55 year old registered nurse, and the second witness is 60 year old retiree/ small business owner.   This evening as my husband and I were driving west on Broad Street, I observed about 8 orange lights in the southern sky.  They appeared at first to look like maybe chinese lanterns as they were floating from the horizon up and eastward toward Columbus.  They appeared to be fairly close, like they may have been released from the Battelle Darby Metro Park a few miles south of Broad Street.  I continued to watch as I had never seen any lights like this.  I wondered if they might have been a new type of firework as this is July 4th weekend and a lot of folks were letting off private fireworks in the area.  These lights didn't extinguish like I would have expected however.   I turned south on Murnan Road and lost sight of them because of some trees.  When I caught sight of them again, they appeared to be over the city of Columbus maybe 10 miles away.   Both my husband and I were surprised by the distance they covered.  We continued to watch as I tried to follow in the car.   From Murnan, I turned north on Alton, east on Hall, south on Galloway, and then east on Alkire.  Our view was obscured by trees during a good bit of this drive, but by the time we got to the golf course we then saw 4 bright white lights above the Grove City suburb just southwast of the city of Columbus.  These may or may not have been related to the 8 orange lights we viewed a bit earlier.   I pulled over into the back of the firehouse parking lot to get a better view.  These 4 lights did some unexpected things--on occasion one or more would fade out and then illuminate again, the lights would move around a bit, combine and then break apart.   There would be 4 then 2 then 3 then 4 again until eventually they all combined into one very bright white light which kind of blinked out.   During this time we both attempted to film with our iPhones but just couldn't get ! it together before the lights were gone.  They were absolutely! mesmerzing like I couldn't take my eyes off them.  We waited awhile, ready to film but they didn't come back- until later that is... At approximately 1020 pm, I was on my deck watching the sky when one orange light, just like the original 8 we  saw earlier this evening, came up from the west horizon and floated up and eastbound, more toward Hilliard, a suburb northwest of Columbus.   This was followed by a second orange light maybe 20 seconds later and following about the same path as the first.  These both faded as they went upward as if they were going into the clouds. This evening was partly cloudy, it had rained earlier in the day.  The temperature was around 76 degrees.  There were a lot of private fireworks going off as this is the weekend following the 4th of July.   Our first sighting was at dusk and the second was dark.   This is an area that is northeast of Wright Patterson AFB.  We also have Rickenbacher close to the sighting area- it was a former AFB.",

My husband, our son, my brother, and I were at the South Drive-In Theater in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday, July 6, 2013, about to watch a movie around 9:20pm when over in the southern sky, under the clouds, we saw four round white lights in the sky.   We were facing west towards screen 1.  The sun had already set in the west but there was still a sliver of light in the western sky. These four lights were in lateral wavy line.  Then they moved into a triangle formation.  Each of the three round lights were at each point of the triangle and the fourth went to the left of the triangle and it's light went out.  They were in the triangle formation for about 5-10 seconds.   Then they went into a straight vertical line along with the fourth joining the three, which the fourth lit back up to get into formation.  They were in that pattern for about 10-15 seconds.   Then they dispersed from the pattern laterally from one another, however staying relatively close to each other.   All four of them started to descend in altitude until we could see them no more due to the tree line.   The whole duration was approximately 3-4 minutes.  We could tell these lights were several miles away and that they flew with a purpose, not a random act.  They flew at a leisurely pace.  I knew they were not fireworks and they were not planes.  There were people shooting off fireworks on the other side of the South Drive-In Theater.  There was also a commercial jet flying to the southwest of the four UFO's, heading southeast during the time the four lights were in the sky.  Afterward, there were two helicopters that flew over to where the four UFO's had been.  The helicopters seem to be searching for while.  They searched for approximately 10 minutes or so.  Although, we did not pay much attention to the helicopters after that.  I've never seen anything like this before.  All four of us saw them.  A lady in a car next to us was recording them with her cell phone after I pointed them out.  I hope she puts the video on YouTube.  I did not have anything to video record the four lights unfortunately.",

It looked like something on fire very high up in the air.  It looked to be about the height of a helicopter but there was no sound.  There a a lot of trees in the neighborhood and it went behind some heading east and gaining altitude. We went to the front yard where the object seemed to be much higher at this point and had turned heading northeast.  My uncle said it seemed to be changing course as it went.  There was not a trail behind it like you would expect if it was on fire and moving as quickly as it was.  The intensity of the orange/fire would change as well and when it started heading northeast it looked more like a light than a fire.  Columbus is very close to a major airport and we get planes all the time, there were planes much higher so we could compare the lights and sound and there was no sound coming off this object.  And no blinking lights as with aircraft.",

      "story": "Bright amber lights travelling toward airport and army base I was in the process of getting a few items out of my car before going into the back yard and sit by the pool, admire the full moon, and make a phone call.  I don't recall why I looked up into the sky but I looked up and there were two amber colored lights floating across the sky.   A small airport is 2-3 miles away so I am accustomed to seeing objects in the sky but nothing like this. I have been an airplane buff since I was a kid and, even as an adult, I still look up to the sky when aircraft pass over.  I know that airplanes have red and green blinking lights and that's what caught my attention, the fact that they were steady lights and amber-colored.  They looked to be fairly low-flying, perhaps no more than 500 ft above me and flying over the spot 200 yards away from where I was standing. As I saw these two lights coming in my direction, at first I thought, \"That is something big, because I was thinking it was the lights on the front of a plane's landing gear.   But then I could determine space between the two lights, with sky in the background, and I realized it was two separate entities. I listened for sound but heard absolutely nothing.  No propeller, no jet engine, zero sound.  Even with the light of a full moon, I could not determine the shape of any sort of craft.  They just looked like two bright lights floating across the sky. The lights were traveling at a steady velocity and did not deviate from each other. They were traveling towards the southwest, directly at the airport.  Also in the southwest direction, a few miles beyond the airport, is a large U.S. Army base.  Thus, at the time, I thought I was seeing some sort of experimental military aircraft. I watched the lights for as long as I could see them. They seemed to slow down as they approached the approximate vicinity of the airport but that may have simply been an illusion as they got farther away from me. Eventually, they were hidden by the trees and I could no longer see them so I don't know what direction/action they took once they reached the airport.",

We saw what looked like 3 to 5 dark orange hovering orbs still and silent.  Position was N to Ne just above tree line. Next, as we turned canoe to get a better look the large low hovering orbs began to float up and away glowing like Chinese lanterns.  However, we knew they were not.  At first they looked like large oval glowing jellyfish then appeared to shift into a more lantern like shape as they floated upwards silently. The third phase was when they appeared smaller and more brightly colored but were still much bigger and lower than stars.  They locked into a formation at about fifty degrees above the horizon and floated in that formation more directly north.  This formation looked like the top of Orion the Hunter, or possibly a circular form with a shape inside it much like an arrow or cross.  Unfortunately part of this formation was hidden behind a building on the end of the lake so we couldn't fully make it out. The next phase of this encounter was 8 to 10 stars looking like they were blinking in multi colored lights much like Christmas lights.  Their appearance in size was at least 10 to 20 times larger than an actual star would appear.  It would be comparable to holding a dime about a foot in front of your eye, but a little more cylindrical.  They resembled radio stars in they way they flashed multiple colors blue, white , red , yellow, green.  They danced around each other like bees over flowers in silent circles somewhat erratic in this pattern as if they were swirling around each other. Finally they organized once again and formed a perfect hatchet shape with the rectangular piece facing west at the top and a long handle on the right or east side each dot representing a light bright type of design of perfect angles to create a clear shape.  They flashed a couple of times as though to show off their display, or the final act of this show. Lastly they filed slowly out of the hatchet type of shape drifting off to the Northwest sky, up and away.  They almost seemed to puff out one by one like a burnt out firework.  We were so transfixed at this point we didn't want the experience to end.  They seemed to possess an intelligence.  They seemed to know we were watching.  One final light lingered as we focused on it, then disappeared into the NW along with the others.",

      "story": "Line of bright white, flashing lights. No sound, despite seemingly low altitude. At approximately 10:30 PM EST, on 7/16/2014, I looked up to witness a 'line' of flashing lights in the sky.  My view was not obscured by any trees or other objects, and the sky was clear.   The lights were not flashing in a synchronized fashion, but seemed to be blinking on and off independently of one another, with each doing so at fairly regular intervals of every two seconds or so.  The lights seemed to be close to the ground, but - sans a point of reference to judge distance by - I only say that because of how large and bright they were.  There were perhaps eight to ten lights that I could see all at once, stretching from a point directly overhead, from north to south, until the roof of my apartment building blocked my view.   I watched this go on for around fifteen seconds, then realized that the number of lights seemed to be decreasing; it did not look as if they were ascending, or flying away outside of my field of vision, but rather that every few 'blinks', one of the lights would not light up again. At that point I ran inside to get my fiance.   When we got back outside, we went directly to the rear (south) of our apartment building. Since the 'line' stretched in that direction, and presumably beyond my line of sight, I assumed we would have a better view of whatever lights remained from that vantage.  This turned out to be the case, as we BOTH still saw four or five of the lights - as well as a single plane flying east to west at a higher altitude than the lights were when I originally saw them - flashing on and off.  Only, by this time, they were much further away from our location, and seemed to be at a higher altitude. Our view was also obscured at that point by a number of trees.  My fiance still definitely saw them as well, though I wish she could have seen them as I originally had.  (For the last hour and a half, I've been constantly refreshing local news sights and google searches, hoping to find a similar report from someone local.  So far I've seen nothing.  But what I have found is a video from San Diego that shows nearly exactly what I saw, only in that video the lights were at a greater height:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot9R6wE4Wtw  And a picture that looks remarkably similar to what I saw during the brief times when all of the 'objects' were lit up simultaneously:  http://humboldtsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ufo-blinking-lights.bmp)  The lights were bright white in color.

It was silent and slowed to a stop a few degrees southeast of the field I was in and appeared to drift rapidly from side to side, speed up, and slow down moving rapidly in different directions at a very high altitude.  It continued moving from east to west in an erratic manner far above the clouds with no jet trails or sound.  The object would appear to stop and then dart rapidly as it were moving very fast but over a very small arc less than a tenth of a degree.  It gradually seemed to drift south of me from east to west but approached the area I was in more rapidly slowing almost to a stop.  It was partly cloudy and there were no stars in the sky.  The sun had set half an hour before. It was around 9:45 PM. At one point it was moving so slowly I thought it might be moving in the opposite direction it came but there was definitely a subtle and rapid darting from side to side.  I noticed nothing else in the sky that seemed to reflect or emit light at the time.  The dot may have had a slightly yellowish tint.  What was unusual was that it seemed to approach the field I was in very rapidly as though it were a plane traveling in one direction and once it were about three or four degrees southeast of me it stopped and drifted very slowly darting around erratically but subtly.  I got tired of watching it as it moved slowly south and west from me continuing the erratic darting and slowing as it were not moving quickly enough across the sky for me to watch it go to the horizon.  I could not identify the object.  It could have been a satellite or space station or something not extraterrestrial, but what was unusual was that it had slowed and stopped a few degrees from where I was and darted around.",

Hello, in 1966 my brother and I both had morning paper routes and lived on the west side of Columbus, Ohio, at the corner of Briggs Road and Wedgewood Drive. I don\u2019t know the exact time but it was dark outside as we delivered our papers and returned home.  I also don\u2019t remember the time of year but it seems to me it was summer. As we stepped out of the back door of our apartment building, there was an object directly overhead and was stationary.  The object made no noise and it was reddish-orange in color. It would vary in light intensity slowly. I said to my brother, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d (more of a statement than a question) and he replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, the moon I guess.\u201d  Well, it wasn\u2019t the moon because the moon was out and high in the sky to the north of us. The size of this object was large.  I will attempt to describe the size as being the size of the moon as it appears at moon rise on the horizon but this was directly overhead. Anyway, I was just curious as to whether or not you have any other reports from roughly that time frame. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

Houses were on long, narrow ten acre lots - about two tenths of a mile up a hill on the edge of the woods.   I was fifteen years old and regularly sneaking out - no fear!   I was walking home alone at 1 am.  Fifty feet from my driveway, up to my left, out of the north sky came a large lighted object..  It stopped in mid air just past the edge of the woods.  Scared, I hid behind a large oak tree peeking, not knowing what to do.  It made no noise - no movement. I knew \"they\" knew I was there, so I ran up the driveway stopping in front of my house.  Approx one- two hundred feet away at tree top level was a saucer shaped aircraft with pale colored, rectangular lights around the bottom.  The lights were white, red, blue, and glowing.  Maybe an acre in size - it just stayed there. I didn't dare move - it came to me \"they\" wouldn't hurt me.  Who were \"! they\"?  It finally moved at the same level slowly south parallel to I71, with a slight up and down motion.  On top of the hill, I could see it for maybe a few miles and it made three loud, high pitched, whirling noises and went straight down.  I had left my friends house at 1am, when I next looked at the time it was 3 am.  A short time later I saw headlines in the Columbus dispatch where an airforce pilot reported a UFO sighting.  I had my proof.  Now I always wonder.. where did 2 hours go during the time I was outside with the ufo?  Could I have been upducted?  I've had a bump behind my ear the I always pick at, its bothersome.. and I don't remember always having it.  And since this day, I have been obssessed with UFO's.",

There were no other stars visible anymore so it caught my eye that there was a very large, very bright star off to the Southwest in the sky. Except when I looked closer at it, it was flickering incredibly fast between mostly white, but also blue and red. The lights flickered for the duration of the event. It then occurred to me that the shape was not regular for a star and rather than a dot, it was a long cross-like shape.  At first it appeared stationary, but then I found a place to view it where I could set it against a stationary object in the foreground, and observed it was actually moving. It listed to the left, or right, sort of randomly and moved slightly downwards several times. Movement seemed random, just sort of listlessly floating around, and then it started rising up. As it rose, it became slightly more dim and moved up very, very slowly, appearing as if it were moving away from the earth at a very acute angle of ascent.  We live near an airport, so I see and hear planes coming and going all the time, and this did not appear to be a plane. The flashing lights were reminiscent of a police siren, and it was far too far away and/or small to be a plane. I observed it with binoculars, but could see no increased details. Eventually, after twenty to thirty minutes of slowly moving away and up it became too faint to view and by then the sun was up enough that we lost sight of it.  It continued moving in a Southwesterly direction for the duration of the event in an area of the sky that lies south of the airport I am near. Flatmate claimed to hear sounds, but I did not hear anything, and other aircrafts were regularly flying overhead, into and out of the airport to the east.",

Three red beams of light were shining brightly in the shape of a triangle.  What was most odd was that the object seemed to hover in the same location (unlike an airplane) for several minutes.  At first, I thought the object was shaped like a stealth bomber, except that it appeared white in color.  My other thoughts was that the red, glowing objects had white beams of light connecting them together. I ran inside to tell my husband and daughter to come outside to verify what I saw.  By the time they got outside, there were only two, red glowing lights connected by a single white beam of light.  My daughter saw the bottom one disappear first and then the top one followed suit.  My husband also saw the two lights fade away into the sky. During this time, I ran through my house to the backyard to see if they would travel in a typical flight path.  However, there were absolutely no signs of the objects.  Their disappearance was quite unusual in nature. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

      "story": "High speed lead craft leaves three others in its wake It was my first Spring Quarter at the not-yet-named, \u201cThe Ohio State University.\u201d  It was late afternoon, probably the middle of May, 1967, when I left my room, # 332, to call my best friend, in an adjacent dowm.  It was the inaugural year of Nosker House, my dorm in the newly opened north complex of residence halls.  He lived on the first floor of Drackett Tower, to my north, and on the west side of his building.  Although we had phones in our dorm rooms, they were only able to access in-house phones.  To call outside the dorm we had to use the phones located in the stairwell, mine was on the west side of the building. So here is my report. As I was waiting for my buddy to answer his phone - located in his room and able to access in-house and out-of-house calls \u2013 I looked up and saw four jets flying in a diamond formation.  I was intrigued by these jets as they flew east to west and were at an attitude of about ten-thirty as seen out my stairwell window.  I don\u2019t know their altitude, but they were way up there!!!  No wings could be defined, but I had often seen jets (probably military since commercial aircraft don\u2019t fly in formation) flying at this altitude.  As soon the phone was answered, I immediately asked, \u201cHey look out your window, can you see those four jets up there?\"  I planned to give him more information as to their being a bit to the north, and quite high. In the time that it took me to utter those few words, the lead craft hit the accelerator and completely flew to the end of my visible horizon and out of my scope of visibility.  We are talking hundreds (?) thousands (?) of miles based on the altitude.  The three remaining jets continued at a snail\u2019s pace, although I am sure they were travelling at a high rate of speed - for them.  There was no contrail, no noise heard - no deviation of direction, just an incredible display of speed like I had never seen before, or since - and that was 48 years ago.

Myself and a friend were sitting outside and we saw an amber light (ball) appear on the horizon, it was low, perhaps 5000 feet, no noise whatsoever, and traveling at the speed which one could say was similar to a small high performance prop aircraft, faster than a helicopter but not real real fast.  We watched it track closer and it took a gradual curve and we watched it as it slowly disappeared on the far horizon.  We then saw a second one, originating at the same point as the first one, it too followed a similar path. Subsequently, there were 3 or 4 more, and at one point we had eyeballs on two of them as one was fading and another had started.  I'm gonna say each one from start to finish was about two minutes. My friend lives in a neighborhood with curving streets all over so unfortunately I cannot give you an orientation as to North/South etc., as I'm not sure the exact direction where they first manifested since I have no clue as to which way the backyard faces.

I looked up to the sky because I saw blue light out the corner of my eye.  It was to the right.  At first I thought it was a shooting star because it was moving so fast.  But as it flew further from me, I saw blue light from the left as well.   That\u2019s when I realized the lights were a part of the same structure.  It appeared to be on the wings of a massive sort of flattened crescent shaped structure.  And I mean massive.  It stretched from one side of the sky to the other.  If it were on the ground, it cover several miles.  I couldn\u2019t see the center and body of it well, but I could see where the lights were.  The wings were thin and very aerodynamic looking.   The body of it was shadowy.  But, I could see the stars through the body of it as if it were kind of transparent.  It was very fast and extremely quiet.  That\u2019s how I know it wasn\u2019t man made.  I\u2019m ex-military and I\u2019ve seen most of what we can do.   Our technology is junk compared to this thing.  We cannot create something so massive and so fast, yet doesn\u2019t make a sound as it zipped across the night sky.   I waited for news reports.  I just knew people were going to report it.  It was so large.  It was fast and there and gone in under a minute, but it was so large that I figured someone else had to see it.  '' I searched the news and internet.  No reports. I only told my kids about it.  I\u2019m reporting this for the first time, and it feels good to tell someone.  I don\u2019t feel so crazy anymore. I saw a similar picture of a UFO on a tv show a few days ago and that prompted me to find this website.  It wasn't the same.  But, close enough to get my attention.

But they were not stars and they did not appear to be planes.  Besides, I have never seen that many \"planes\" in the same area at the same time before.  And there was absolutely No Sound.   I just want to know what there were and if anyone else seen them.",

They were rather bright so I thought maybe it was a helicopter.  It suddenly stopped its motion and just hovered, absolutely motionless.  Then it quickly reversed from its original direction with great acceleration and then stopped again 3 seconds later.  (There was no spot light from it ever.) It did this for a few minutes and then quickly flew north.  All motion was very angular and when it hovered, which is unlike normal helicopters.  I couldnt make out any sound, but there was a lot of background noise being by the highway.  It was a clear night sky.  No other strange phenomenon occured.  I hope someone else saw it too.

I looked southwest toward gsp airport and noticed the very bright space station, or Venus or whatever and o was captivated by what I saw, the stars were moving eratically.  I looked north away from the airport and started noticing stars were chasing each other at high speeds yet no tail was visible, all research I done today by calling news Channel 4 and gsp tower cotrol, to see if they had seen anything was in vain, I guess I was the only one in north or South Carolina to witness the event.  They were in battle formations, I saw at least half a dozen aerial dogfights but not close up, they looked like stars but moved at incredible speeds.  I also seen that when these fights occurred the UFOs involved were suddenly enveloped in what I can only describe as a dark cloud formation, which obstructed a lot of the visual details.  I woke my gf to witness what I was seeing, more for my reassurance of sanity than anything else and they didn't let us down, we watched as they did tit for tat until dawn when it all stopped and the sky was clear. It is very surreal and kinda scary.  What has our government done!??  The grey alien agenda, secret deals trading human lives for alien tech??  I believe all the lies are coming out soon, and when it does, you need to be prepared for it!  The US is shooting down other entities for fear they will stop the Greys aliens and ultimately restrict giving out too much technology to a race that can't even get along in its on world with humans, how much more dangerous could it be for the other factions of Aliens that have no agenda except to observe and record.  If anyone else happened to see the events I spoke of in Polk County, NC, or surrounding states by all means please put it out here.  We quite possibly could all be in very grave danger, not just the!

The craft then very slowly hovered right past our window, there was probably 8 to 10 yellowish-white lights on the side we could see, and at least two red lights on the belly of the craft.  This thing was literally at the height of the power lines, made virtually no sound until it was passing right next to the house.  It made a very faint humming sound - we live really close to an airport so we're pretty familiar with airplane sounds and their landing lights. It was a black triangle shape from what we could make out. It was insane how close we were to this thing.  You could've probably pegged this thing with a rock, it was flying so low.

It actually descended vertically with no horizontal movement.  We saw no red or green lights present on the craft.  (Indicating a commercial or even military aircraft.)  It came from the North, until it got around some trees, made a gradual 90 degree turn and began heading to the West.  (In the direction of the airport here.)  We see tons of planes coming in and landing all day, everyday.  This thing was not a commercial airliner. It was flying entirely too slow, too low, and was way too quiet to be a passenger airliner, and had too many lights on it.  (And in the wrong places/not having the correct lights for an airplane.)  It flew pretty slowly past the house, it was probably about 100 - 250 feet away (maybe a bit more) from the house, and it was flying at a pretty low altitude, I'd guess somewhere around maybe 200-400 feet area possibly.  I actually managed to snap a few quick pictures of the thing, which I will attach to this. What was odd to me was the fact that there weren't any other airplanes coming in for about 10 - 15 minutes before this craft came, and nothing came in to the airport for about 15 - 20 minutes after we saw the craft.  There is also an Air Force base pretty close by (Rickenbacker AFB), but that base is roughly 30 minutes to the South of us. This one did have a sound, like a plane - but a very, very quiet plane. (It was more quiet than a single prop airplane.) We didn't hear the noise of it until it was passing the house, and for a brief moment after it had already passed by the house. It had at least 6 - 7 bright white lights present on it. (That's only counting the lights on the left side and back side of the craft.) It was very dark, but it was most likely a black craft, and the way the lights were situated on the craft, it had to be a triangular craft. Note:  Normally we hear crickets outside all night long, but when this craft hovered past us, it was dead quiet outside with the occasional sound of vehicles on the nearby highways and the craft when it hovered by.",

Unfortunately there are several tree lines so I didn't see it firsthand, but was fascinated by what he got a picture of.   He said the light was stationary and changed from purple to yellow, light blue to white, and then faded into blackness (visible for only a few moments).",

While driving south on Maple Canyon (about 50 yards north of the Dublin-Granville Rd intersection) I came to a stop due to a red traffic light.  A flash of white light ahead in the clear blue sky caught my eye, at first thinking it was an airplane.   By judging the distance/height of the object, I would place it somewhere around 15,000 ft in the air, appearing to be about the diameter of 1.5-2 commercial airliners.  The white light (circular/oval shape) became smaller (about half the size), returned to its original size, then with a flash of chrome suddenly appearing (as if turning or changing shape and reflecting sunlight possibly), a thinner flat shape became visible and without the white circular/oval light.  While still stopped due to traffic I never lost focus of the object, but it then completely vanished.   No trails visible anywhere near where I witness the object, only clear blue skies.  The duration of the event was 10-15 seconds.",

The aircraft was approximately 200 yards from rear corner to rear corner.  There were white lights on each corner, a total of three lights.  There were no other lights visible.   The aircraft was so large and so low it felt like we could have thrown a rock and hit it.  There was absolutely no sound emitting from the craft.   It flew overhead very slowly and headed towards the main area of the Fort Benning military installation.  I should state that our location was almost adjacent to the military installation boundary and the craft was moving parallel to the boundary.  It continued moving in south trajectory, until it disappeared.   We all looked at each other and asked if anyone knew what we witnessed.  Everyone stated that they did not know what it was.

But here is an account of the incident.  I fell asleep on my couch in Columbus, OH at around 1:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on 7-8-17.  Then I woke up on my back, inside of what I equated to being an enclosed tanning bed-like apparatus.  It felt as if I was traveling at a high rate of speed and the ride was very turbulent.  I began to look around and one of the things I remember seeing is a worn down \"yellow labeling\" on the inside of whatever the hell I was enclosed in.  The next thing I know, at least my head was no longer enclosed as I saw an alien take an object and touched my forehead with it and I was \"out cold\".  I woke back up on couch in the exact same position I fell asleep on with my CPAP on just as it was prior to this \"possible abduction\".  I had no fear, not sure why..  In the ensuing minutes after waking up I tried to make sense of what had happened.  There was no missing time, I was back up within a half hour. Had a sick like feeling in my stomach, open waking up and its been on and off all day. Description of the alien I saw:  Structurally, it was similar to many of the common air craft aliens we see in our American pop culture documentaries (Short around 3 feet, thin body, big dark eyes, funny shaped head) accept this one had rather dark scaly skin, not true gray.  One the the things that stood out was the wide of its arm and forearm, it was the equivalent of a broomstick width the arm was the same width as the forearm.  I was unconscious seconds after he put the object between my eyebrows and forehead. Other information about me which you may or may not find relevant. Since the age of 8 years old I have been an experiencer of sleep paralysis -entity attacks, but even before this the paranormal world seemed to antagonize me at a really young age.  I can remember some things just before the age of two.  I've had thousands of negative nocturnal (non physical) attacks by paranormal entities, like smacking, prodding, choking and senses manipulation (I've also had a few positive ones like when I was tapped on the shoulder after falling asleep while feeding my infant son a bottle which caused the nipple to go adrift from his mouth.   Lately, I'd say within the last year, I've seen very bright lights in my dreams on more than one occasion.  I have been \"spiritually probed\" several times, mostly in the back of my head - cerebellum, but also in the navel and unfortunately my fudge tunnel a time or two. I'm not psychotic or mental, I've never done drugs, and rarely consume alcohol.",

My close friend (to this day in 2018) and I were driving from Houston, TX to Austin, TX between 11pm-2am sometime during the 3rd week of July. I merged on TX 71 West from Interstate-10 in Columbus, Texas.  About 20 miles down TX 71 West, I noticed what I thought was an airplane about 30-50k feet up, with blue glowing beacon lights.  Even back then, when I was 18 years old, I knew that no airplane (to my knowledge) had glowing blue lights.  I pointed this out to my friend (also 18 then) and we were watching the light move across the sky like an airplane, as I explained to him for about two minutes how planes don't have blue lights and I wonder if it's military etc; it's hard to describe this how I saw it; so bare with me.  The light was  moving slowly across the sky like a plane - very normal, then in 1 second it shot off at light speed into the sky - - NOT across the sky into the horizon, I mean in to the clouds directly away from the ground, the way it zipped off, I have and never will see anything like it again. That object zipped away so fast, like a movie, I think about it all the time up to this day, and nobody believes us.  It was not a comet, I see those weekly when I am in Texas.  I investigated all the Texas July 2011 reports and nobody has reported this, even though somebody near Columbus, TX, HAD to have seen it. The only color I saw was blue, and the craft was not close to the ground.  This was at 1am with good visibility.  Whatever this light was, it left the Earth at light speed.  I have personally never seen a UFO, or anything abnormal in the sky aside from this incident when I was 18 back in 2011.  My girlfriend at the time thought I was crazy.

      "story": "My neighbor and I were sitting in his front yard located near the Westgate area of Columbus, Ohio, when I noticed a golden orange light traveling west just to the south of our location.  I thought it was a jet making its approach to Columbus International Airport as I normally see them do. As it reached a position nearly due south of us, it turned north (as jets typically do to make their final approach to the airport).  When it cleared the trees, it was obvious this was no jet.  It was a steadily glowing orange object, no sound, no blinking lights and no sign of navigational lights.  This is when I called my friend's attention to it. We watched it reach an angle of about 60 degrees in altitude from where we were standing, it stopped and hovered, emitting a bright and steady orange glow.  There was no \"beam\" as typically seen from a helicopter search light, just the steady, unchanging glow. After hovering for about 10 seconds, it began to slowly move back southeastward and the glow gradually dimmed until it was just a faint speck.  After it disappeared, we sat back down and tried to find a logical explanation for what we just saw. It was about 2 minutes later, it reappeared again coming north almost straight toward us.  Once it cleared the trees, it  stopped and hovered near the same location for about 10 seconds before nearly retracing its path in a south-southwest direction and dimming till we lost sight of it. This occurrence being between 10 and 11PM, the neighborhood was very quiet so it was easy to discern that there was no sound created by the object.  There were no other lights on it, it did not leave a trail.",

It felt like the object had lights projecting off the sides because it was so bright.  My eyes started watering from how bright it was and I couldn't look away, but I could see that there was no bulging shapes like one would see on a plane.  It was remarkable and then it flew over a building and I could no longer see it.  Easily the most bizarre moment of my life.  Keep in mind, it was almost three in the afternoon with zero clouds in the sky, so this object was almost like an immense mirror flying at a distance.

I watched it for at least 2 hours and it seemed to move occasionally.  It was much bigger than a star and would pulsate and flash or blink.  Sometimes it would go much dimmer.i took many videos and zoomed way in with a camera app on my phone to took several photoa.  They are not the best quality but the object seems to have a circle in the middle of an x in the visible ones.  My phone kept shutting off as if I had no battery even though it was well charged.   Eventually I left and was wondering what it could have been.  My friend whos house it was didn't think it was a ufo of any kind and blew the idea off.   July 3rd late at night we saw the same light in the same exact spot and I felt embarrassed thinking I must have been wrong about the ufo idea.  It must be a satellite or something else.  I'm not sure but two times in the same spot made me doubt myself.  Then there was last ni! ght July the 4th. I saw the same light again.  It seemed brighter and this time there was also a 2nd one a ways across the sky.   I was no certain something is going on and when I went inside to get my phone to take a picture I came back out and it was completely gone.  The first light remained there and didn't seem to do anything strange.  Aside from the occasional flashes and blinks it never flew or moved.  It seemed to just stay in the same place.

Anyway, my vision out of my one eye was a little blurry because it looked as if I was looking through a clear kaleidoscope.  I felt like I was telling them to go away and leave me alone and so they did.  This time, I didn't wake up from that, I just kept sleeping.  So, what I acknowledged was going on (I think telepathically) was my vision from that one eye was crystallized.  And also telepathically, I told them to stop and they looked like \"why were doing something good for you.\"  And they hurried up and left me with my blurry eye.  Like, I could see their heads moving and looking at one another conversing among each other to hurry, but they didn't hesitate much until I realized \"wait a minute, I'm stronger than you \" that's when they fled entirely and I slept peacefully without waking up from the experience.",

My findings are that we do have craft, 10 at the present and that we have already been traveling with them for decades.  I also am seeing that the Moon does have a secret base on the far side, occupied by us, Israel and of course ETs.  Money spent by us alone, comes at around $750 billion over the course of it's existence and construction has been partnered 3 ways. \tThe other facts that I've seen are that the craft have the ability to go from Earth to Moon in 15 minutes and Earth to Mars in 2 1/2 hrs. to a base that's there, too. \tThe old Majestic 12 group are now a group of 32, headed by an Air Force General, Marc Jamison, also commanding the secret M.I.B. unit.  His name came to me letter by letter and afterwards all I had to do was to Google his name and below is what I was totally amazed to find.  Excerpt from the internet: Col Marc Jamison, (ret.), USAF, Former Director of Future Operations, J35 and Chief Modeling and Simulation (USCYBERCOM), CSFI Advisory Director    Colonel (Ret) Marc Jamison consults on Cyber Security, Strategy and Operations for his own company Cyber CheckMate Consultants. He has consulted for over 30 industry partners supporting cyber operations. Recently, he completed a tour at STG as their VP of DOD and IC Business Development. From 2013-2016 he supported the US Army as they build their new Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) concept combing Cyber and Electronic Warfare. He worked for L-3 Communications as the Director of Cyber Operations and Director of Strategic Ventures that included Merger & Acquisition evaluations and oversight of strategic partnerships with universities Colonel Jamison has more than 30 years of progressive experience directing, managing, and training government teams in air operations and cyber security. He has led and planned national Cyber, Counter Terror and Air Operations and has advised senior-level USG leadership on strategies and policy. Colonel Jamison is a demonstrated expert in cyber strategy, planning, training, threats, operations, policy and organizations. Prior to industry, Colonel Jamison served as J35 Director of Future Operations for USCYBERCOM and as the J3 Director of Operation for its predecessor organization Joint Functional Component Commander \u2013 Network Warfare (J3) at Ft. Meade. He spent three years as a senior executive establishing USCYBERCOM, a \u201cplank holder\u201d, where he directed multiple national level operations and developed cyber doctrine and tactics, techniques and procedures. Colonel Jamison is a retired U.S. Air Force Colonel and combat aviator, who flew B-52 and B-1 bombers. He was the Director of USAFE\u2019s Strategy Division and commanded the Combat Plans Squadron for 8th Air Force. He is a graduate of the School for Advanced Air and Space Studies and USAF Weapons School. He holds four Master\u2019s degrees, including an M.S. in Strategic Studies from the U.S. Army War College and is a published author. Colonel Jamison serves on the Board of Directors for Association of Old Crows, Cyber Security Forum Initiative (CSFI) and on San Antonio\u2019s Chamber of Commerce Cyber Industry Council .  \tLast information that I sought was where these ETs have been coming from.  Without putting a whole lot of time into it, I'm seeing that we are the only advanced specie in the Milky Way, the Greys are the only ones in the entire Andromeda Galaxy and the next 2 closest Galaxies after that have no advanced species.  The Greys have the ability to travel here in 8 hrs. by bending Space/Time.",
