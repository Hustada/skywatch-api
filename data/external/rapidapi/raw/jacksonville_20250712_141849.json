      "story": "These are accounts of several personal UFO and 'other' experiences. 1) The January 2005 UFO sighting, Jacksonville, Florida:  Shortly after dusk on the evening of January 19, 2005, I was closing the curtains in the band room of my West Jacksonville home.  While doing so, I noticed a very bright light in the sky, larger than a star, which was changing colors, hovering and moving slightly up and down, which was located in the ESE sky. I called for my live in boyfriend to observe as well, in which he did.  We watched the object for a good ten to fifteen minutes, as it appeared to hover, and make only slight movement in the sky, mostly in an up and down motion, but sometimes slightly back and forth.  The object appeared to grow brighter and dimmer at times, but did not seem to be 'traveling,' like a plane. In the center of this object, stretching horizontally across the object, the lights emanating from the object changed colors frequently, and one could clearly distinguish that this was not a star or planet. My boyfriend and myself both noted that this was not a star or planet from it's slight movements, and the line of lights which changed colors, and noted that it was not like any aircraft which we normally see from where we live, because of it's movements, and sometimes the lack thereof.  We heard no noise from this object. I began cooking supper, but occasionally checked back on the object, which was there several times when I checked on it, but eventually disappeared. One interesting note, in another account of the January sighting, the person witnessed the UFO on the 15th, we witnessed it on the 19th, however, the witness was on HWY 301, which is not far from our house.  We live on Cahoon Rd, off Normandy Blvd, which runs into, and ends at HWY 301.    Normandy Blvd., Jacksonville, FL 32205  This incident can be verified by my current boyfriend of 4 years.  I did notice several conventional style aircraft flying in the same area that night which may be able to substantiate this story further.  .....................................................................................  2) The electrical assault incidence:  This may sound very strange, but on my word of honor, this is the truth, and did in fact happen. In 2003 or 2004, my memory escapes me as to which year exactly in which this occurred but, one afternoon I was washing dishes at the same address as the above incidence, and I was alone in my house, as my live in boyfriend was at work.  I became aware of a strange frequency which I could hear which seemed especially 'targeted' at my right ear.  This frequency was a lower pitch than the frequencies I normally pick up on from time to time, and seemed strange that it seemed 'targeted' at the right ear, instead of being heard by both of them.  What was also strange was this frequency was also felt as well as heard.  As I experienced this frequency, I also experienced a strange sensation in my head, almost like a slight stun to my brain.  Though I found this to be quite odd, it did not become unpleasant until a few seconds later when from this frequency I suddenly experienced what felt like an electric shock to the upper right side of my head, which felt like I was being zapped by a stun gun!  This immediately brought me to my knees!  After about a minute, I returned to my feet, (quite startled, scared and somewhat pissed off), only for this to happen once again! Immediately after somewhat regaining my composure, I grabbed a pistol and searched the house for an intruder and a possible explanation, but I discovered that I was indeed alone in the house, with the doors locked.  I had never before experienced anything like this, nor have I since, however I am now quite frightened when I hear frequencies. I debated with myself the idea of calling up the military to see if they were doing some kind of military weapons testing using frequencies, but declined to do so, as it dawned on me that they probably would not tell me the truth, and them knowing I would sue them for testing on me, I figured that it probably might not be a good idea, as they could (and would), probably kill me by zapping me, if they chose to, rather than being sued, if this occurrence was a result of military testing.  I also pondered that this may be UFO related, as I have had 'other' strange occurrences happen in my lifetime, which I suspect could be UFO related. I have no answers or explanation as to who is responsible, or why this incidence happened, but would truly would like the answer to this.  Have you ever come across any instances like this in your research?  If so, would you please share them with me?  Any input on this is greatly appreciated! .....................................................................................  3) Time loss incidence #2:  In early spring of 1997, I was traveling from Louisville KY, on my way home to Jacksonville, (I lived on the Northside of Jacksonville at this time, but was spending time with my boyfriend at the time, who was a mechanical engineer working in Louisville, while my best friend stayed at my house, held down the fort and cared for my dogs.  One of my dogs was in the pound, and I went home to rescue my dog.) I had stopped at the Pio-Ono (GA) exit on 1-75 late at night, to get gas and coffee, before leaving the parking lot, I put in a fresh 90 minute cassette tape, of some recorded music, (45 minutes per side), which had CCR on one side and Aretha Franklin on the other.  The tape was rewound before I left the parking lot, as I used 90 minute cassette tapes to help 'time' the trip. I got back on I-75 headed south, (I was quite sure of this), and was on my way down the road.  In what seemed like just a few minutes back on the road, I went to take a sip of my coffee, and it was cold, at this point I knew something was weird, as I had just bought the coffee moments before, and it was quite hot at the time, and I take creamer in my coffee, and powdered creamer does NOT dissolve in less than hot liquid, yet the creamer in my coffee was perfectly dissolved.  I then became suddenly aware that the tape I was listening to was well into the other (Aretha) side, and I had not changed it! I kept going on my journey to spite the strange occurrence, pondering an explanation.  A few moments later, I discovered that I was not traveling South as I was sure that I was, but was headed North instead.  (I was starting to weird out at this point). I got off the next exit, and turned around, and started heading South again.  It took me about 20 minutes to reach the Pio-Ono exit once again, and it was at this point, that I understood that I had experienced another time loss episode.  I later told my best friend, and boyfriend (at the time), about the incident, which you can contact both of them concerning this. .....................................................................................  1996 UFO sighting, Jacksonville FL:  One evening while sitting home enjoying an evening alone, (no boyfriend in this incidence LOL, and this event took place at my Northside Jacksonville residence, the same one as the incidence above), I was lounging on the couch, listening to music, and I happened to look out the window at the night sky, and noticed an object fitting the exact same description of the UFO in the #1 sighting in the sky.  I observed it just hovering there, moving slightly up and down and sometimes back and forth growing sometimes dimmer, sometimes brighter, and changing colors.  I realized it had to be a UFO. I watched this object for a good half an hour, when my roomate/friend came home, and I told him about the object.  He checked it out, agreed that it was probably a UFO, and after a while, he went to his room, where I did not see him for the rest of the night. I watched the object for a while longer, and suddenly it just disappeared like a light being turned off! This can be verified by my ex-roomate.  .....................................................................................  Time loss incident #1, Jacksonville, FL, 1994:  About 10:45 PM, I went to the convenience store to fetch a soda and a pack of cigarettes before the store closed at 11.  I lived on Deerfield Lane in the sticks off of Starrat Road in North Jacksonville.  This was the only store for about 5 miles, and wanted to get there before the store closed.  This store was only about one half mile away from my home, so the entire trip usually only took 15 minutes tops, even if I stopped to chat with someone, or their was a line, etc.  It was the norm for me to put off making the trip until the last minute, because at the time I was writing a book, and was very much caught up in the process of doing so. When I left, my boyfriend Brian, was sitting in the recliner watching TV.  This too was the norm, as he would retire for the evening customarily after I made my evening run to the store. I went to the store, got my RC and smokes, and headed back home as usual.  When I returned home, the lights in the house were dimmed, and the TV was off.  I thought this very strange.  I started feeling quite spooked for some strange reason, which is NOT the norm for me.  I walked in the door, and there was a very pissed off Brian waiting for me interrogating me as to where I had been!  Of course, I thought he had lost his mind, as I had just been to the store and back as usual. I asked Brian if he had lost his mind, and explained/protested that I had just been to the store and back as usual.  This infuriated him, as he said that I had not been just to the store, that the store has been closed for hours, he began ranting and raving about how he went up there looking for me, I was nowhere to be found, how he called my best friend, blah, blah, blah, and pointed at the clock and said it doesn't take 3 hours to go a half a mile to the store, blah, blah, blah, and proceeded to have a conniption!  I looked at the clock and it was after 2 AM!  I then thought that he had lost his mind, AND was picking a fight with me, that he had moved the hands on the clock. He then tells me to call my best friend Brenda, and let her know I got home safely.  I did. I found out then that Brian had not moved the hands on the clock, that in fact I had a strange and unexplainable time loss eppisode.  (I'm still not convinced that Brian had not lost his mind though, from the conniption he threw.  I then nick named Brian, \"Flyin' Brian\".  LOL.)  Brenda had been very worried about me, as was Brian. I could not explain what had happened during that time, but after that, everytime I had to travel down that stretch of road between the convenience store and home, I was terrified, though I could not offer any logical explanation as to why! Shortly after that, I began having \"nightmares\" in which I could swear I was awake, and these things were happening to me.  I would pinch and even slap myself to make sure I was not dreaming but.... I would 'dream' that I would be awakened by a presence in the room.  I would get up, look around and sometimes there would be typical greys, sometimes no 'seen' being was there, but a presence was felt none the less. I would try to wake up (Flyin') Brian, but never could wake him up when this happened. In this dream, I would wake up, and get up and look out the bedroom window into the field out back which was covered in blackberry briars, and sandy Florida soil, with dips in it, where it was not exactly driveable, and see lights like 8 or ten vehicles lined up outside, complete with dust and sand flying up, in this field.  I could swear that I was awake, but apparently this was a dream, because the next day when I would inspect the field where the lights were, no vehicle tracks were apparent, nor were the blackberry thickets matted down.  This was a fairly regular occurrence.  And like I said, the field was not exactly drivable. Brian and I broke up not long after that, and to this day, I refuse to go down that stretch of road. This incidence can be verified by my ex-boyfriend Brian, and ex-best friend Brenda as well.  .....................................................................................  Fall 1986, UFO sighting, New Bern, NC:  One evening in the Fall of 1986, I went country cruising with a friend and coworker and we decided to take a break from riding, and parked in the Croatan State Park just East of New Bern, NC, and not far from Cherry Point Marine base.  Yes, we had parked to smoke a joint, as hey, we were in our mid-twenties at the time, and to just talk.  (I am now in my mid-fourties, and no longer smoke weed.) As we were sitting in my friend's truck smoking the tater and chatting, we noticed an object, that again matches the description and maneuvers of the other UFO's in the above instances. Both of us, having lived in the area for quite some time were quite aware of the aircraft, military and otherwise, which flew regularly over the area.  This was NOT the normal aircraft which we were accustomed to seeing, and no, the pot was not especially spectacular either. The next day, there were articles in the paper about a rash of UFO sightings seen across the US and the world. This can be substanciated by my friend.  About 6 months, maybe less before this incidence, my mother told me in the strictest of confidence, and after much prying as to what was bothering her, that she was hearing 'signals' one night, kind of like when one hears frequencies, only in something like Morse Code. My mother lived directly across the street from me, and I did not hear them.  My mother never drank or smoked a tater in her life, didn't take so much as an aspirin, and was a very honest, Christian woman.  .....................................................................................  Fall of 1978 UFO sighting, Hendersonville, NC:  About 2 weeks before I was to be married, my mother and I were sitting up discussing \"if I was sure I really wanted to get married or not\" mother and daughter speech.  It was a pleasant night, and we were sitting on the couch with the lights off, and the windows open to her 2nd floor apartment. Mom alerted me to check out the object in the sky.  The object, again matching the same characteristics and maneuvers as the ones in the accounts stated above, only with the slight difference, that there was one large one, and three other smaller vessels which moved about in the sky around the larger one.  They would move in directions that clearly differentiated them from any aircraft we had ever encountered or knew of, and would change colors in tandem with the larger craft. Sometimes these vessels would hover in a triangular pattern around the main vessel, and at times zig-zagged about, or go straight up and down.  We watched these crafts for about 25 minutes, until all of a sudden they took off at tremendous speeds.  We knew from the speed they were traveling, that these had to be UFO's. Unfortunately, my mother is no longer with us to substantiate this story, she died in early 1987 of a rare disease, sideroblastic anemia.  My ex-husband however, can substantiate that Mom and I told him about the incident.",

      "story": "Visitor for the heaves before the Falcon Heavy 9 launch on June 25 2019 It was between 0020 and 0050.  I was walking Mickler Beach that is located in Jackonville, Florida. I was there because I was waiting to see the launch of Falcon Heavy 9 from Cape Canaveral at 230 am.  While I was waiting for the launch to happen I was observing the stars, at the time there was no moon.  I saw a couple of shooting stars and satellites.  When out of the blue I saw this bright light coming from the northwest.    I was impressed so I pull my cellphone and started recording.  It was moving strangely, I concluded that it was no plane or helicopter, because it didn't make any noises and it was just a bright intermittent bright light. after two minutes it looks like it went southeast extremely fast or it went up (I couldn't see it after). I am sending this video to see what it was.  I didn't come to any conclusion. Thank you! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness on two occasions, and he seemed to us to be quite serious-minded.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you so much for the response.  Well like I said in the report I was at the beach. Exactly Mickler Beach. Its located in the city of jacksonville, florida. I was waiting for the rocket falcon heavy 9 launch at 230am on the 25th of June 2009. I don't know why my celluphone didnt picked any stars. It was a clear beautiful night. Moonless for a couple of hours. I was looking at the stars and stuff up there. When from the corner of my eye I sae a shooting star. When I looked the direction in disapeard.  I SAW this very bright light.  Then I took my camera and started filming it. It was doing some crazy moves. And the thing that caught my attention was that it didn't have any directional lighta requeird by the FAA on any fying aircraft. I can't tell what it was and like I said unfortunatly no stars where picked up on my celluphone SAMSUNG GALAXY S10E. It was doing some crazy manouvers and all of the sudden it was gone.  Took of like to the south east.  I was speech less. And all I have ia that video and unfortunatlly I was the only one at that beach.  Again thank you ao much for responding. I wish it had reference points. I saw a report like back in april 30 I thing andit looks like thiS guy saw something similar. ((END ADDENDUM))",

      "story": "light appearing behind satellite, in front of it and then disappearing on 4th of July I live in a pretty old somewhat historic area with very old large trees around my property in every direction that block any distant views. It was 4th of July here in the united states. My boyfriend and I had decided to go outside to see if we could see any fireworks at around 9:15pm central time, we witnessed a few fireworks of a local neighbor & were able to see part of the finale at the local shooting & sports complex that is adjacent to my house several blocks north of my house. Those were the last viewable fireworks we saw from my house, you could still hear the fireworks from several directions but we were not able to see them with all the very large trees surrounding the area. We continued to stay outside, we put a blanket in the back of my boyfriends trailer, both of us having back problems decided to just lay in it and look at the stars & listen to the radio, my boyfriend went inside for a cigarette and i laying there on my back in the trailer looki! ng directly up above me see a slow moving satellite just passing by then out of nowhere i see a gold colored oval shaped o light appear a bit of a distance behind the satellite moving at the same speed trailing it for a brief moment as if it was following it. then the light went out then it reappeared a good distance in front of the satellite & sat there like it was waiting for it to catch up as if it was inspecting it. the light went out again, then came back on a short distance ahead of where it previously was then it disappeared & zoomed off instantly. The sattelite and the object both went south. My boyfriend came back outside & I had told him what I had seen. we stayed outside until about 11pm, the object was not seen again, the satellite had floated off and no more fireworks were seen",

      "story": "Activity after the meteorite hit in Florida On the night of 30 March 2019, I was working as a security officer on the northbound rest stop on interstate 95, near exit 331.  As I was making my rounds, I saw a bright object fall smoothly to the ground.  It was too smooth to be a flare, or fireworks.  Amazed, I walked over to a trucker and asked if he saw what I have just seen.  He said no, we joked for a minute about UFO\u2019s, and he went on his way. I was still confused, so I returned to the spot where I witnessed the light.  As I was staring in the area, two objects appeared in the sky.  They were off set from each other.  They were maneuvering unlike anything I have ever witnessed on this earth.  At first I thought that they were flying bugs in the distance that were attracted to the street light.  But they were flying smoothly around the area where the light fell.  I was still convinced that my eyes were playing tricks with me, because the objects began to mimic my movement.  They would glide back and forth in sequence.  Then they would maneuver around each other.  When I took steps forward, they ascended, then stopped, when I backed up, they would descend, then stop.  I was convinced it was not my eyes because as I continued to stare, they started gliding again.  This went on for about a good 5 minutes.  Then, I guess they got tired of messing around and disappeared. The objects reminded me of a dragon fly.  They were not saucer shaped, and I did not see any lights coming from them.  I would say drones, but I never saw two drones fly next to each other with that much control, and speed. This report may be nothing, but I will never forget what I saw.  I only wrote this report because, I was reading the news today, and they claimed that the light was a meteorite.",

I was staring at the constellation Cassiopeia and then turned my attention behind me, to the south west, where a very bright star was...maybe Jupiter, not sure. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving from right to left..which would have been exactly in a southerly direction. Naturally, automatically i tried to see what it was and soon found a black, boomerang shaped object moving, very steadily across the sky. It had no lights and no visible features and disappeared out of sight, in a very weird kind of fading manner. It is like it flickered out. It was completely silent. The size is very hard to estimate. Since it was black I could not judge the distance or the size. My BEST estimate would be about the length of a football field from end to end. It was moving very straight. My best guess is that it would have been flying directly over the St Johns River, right on the eastern shore, moving southward. Im a few locks from the river, on University blvd W., between San Jose blvd and Powers avenue. A few days later, I went online to see if anything had ever been talked about. I googled \"boomerang ufo\" and got scared with what I found. This is EXACTLY what it looked like, except it was night time and much darker. The other thing, the most significant was this website: www.cassiopaea.org/cass/boom.htm I imagine it is a coincidence that I was staring at Cassiopaea just prior to this since I stare at constellations all the time and it was the only one visible in that direction at that time of night due to the trees on that side of my yard. But...it strikes me as odd, that I REMEMBER having been staring at that specific constellation and secondly of course, that the only time in my life I have ever seen anything like this (a UFO) was immediately upon turning away from looking at it. Please, if you can, read what that website says about contact from the constellation.  I have always been agnostic but open to these things. I am a sane, normal, everyday person that never ever thought it would happen to me...as the story goes..as Ive heard people say. If you have questions, I would be happy to answer them. I could go on about the psychological nature of the experience, which in itself, was unique, but I will leave that open if you wish to ask. Im very glad this is possible to share. This is now a very real thing to me and my desire is great to see us learning what is happening.   here is a link to the page and it is the image top center - www.cassiopaea.org/cass/boom.htm",

      "story": "A mysterious blue light filled my room and I felt a friendly presence. It was one or one-thirty in the morning on a warm summer night in July.  I was only five years old at this time.  My window was open in my bedroom on the first floor of my house, facing towards the backyard.  I had abruptly awoken to a loud humming sound coming from outside.   After a few seconds, I noticed a blue light that seemed to be coming from my open window.  At first, it was very faint and hardly noticeable; but after the course of a few minutes (three to five), the blue light had become so bright that it covered everything in my field of vision.   I tried to go and get my parents, but I was paralyzed, either out of shock from the event or from an unknown force.  All of the sudden, I felt a presence in the room.   At first I was scared, but then I felt a strong reassurance that the presence was not there to harm me.  Then, with an overwhelming flash of white light, the buzzing sound stopped and the blue light disappeared.   After this, I was able to move, and went to the windows to see what had happened.  I looked out into the lawn, and everything looked eerily still.  The trees weren\u2019t moving, the grass wasn\u2019t waving, and there wasn\u2019t a single ripple in the pool.   Since that day, I have never seen that blue light again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

The figure did not go into the light of the street lights, instead it stayed in the shadows.  The figure looked as if it had wings and it's legs were webbed together, as the figured got the closer it started to hover off the ground, the figure went into a neighbor's yard and went to the chain link fence, as the figure stood there it put it's hands on the fench, that  is when we seen the figures face.  The figure had these big black eyes and it looked as if the figure did not have a noise and a small mouth, it was something we have never seen before, there was only 1 figure that we seen.  The object was A ball of fire and it left a trail behind it, you could also see lights on the craft.  The observers was myself and my friend, when we seen the object then the figure, we could not move at all nor run for that matter it was like the figure did not want us to run away like a force field if you will.

I found it disturbing because I could not determine the reason I had awoken. I did not usually wake for no reason. I felt alert and full of adrenaline. I then noticed my old cat looking at something outside. This itself would normally be very odd. She was old and almost blind. She never focused on anything including me. That is when a spotlight illuminated my room for an instant moving from N to W. My room had 3 large (4 ft tall, 1.5 ft wide) windows facing directly south and one window facing west. I quickly pulled my blinds up on 2 of the south facing windows hoping to catch a glimpse of it. My house is close to Cecil field airbase and our house was directly in the path of P-31 Orions on landing approach which normally fly E to W. They never illuminated my room. Sometimes, our local Sheriff  helicopters fly over too which is what I expected to see. They had illuminated my room before but they flew higher, their light was not as blinding, and they tended to fly in circles which this did not do. They also tended to make noise. I was surprised to see a dark circular craft hovering over some nearby tree lines. There was no sound. None. It had an Extremely bright spotlight which was very Blue in color. The craft was moving NNW and its path took it just past my house and past my backyard. I estimated the craft to be hovering at a very low altitude. 50-75 feet above the ground. As it moved, it was also moving its spotlight. After I had opened my blinds, the light had been refocused at the street 60 feet away (South of me) and just to the right of the craft straight down. Again, if facing my house from the north, to the right of my house and south 50 feet on our street. It moved the light quickly north, then northwest and then again into my bedroom where it then stayed (obscuring my view of the craft for most of its time within my vision) focused on me as the UFO moved towards, and then past my house. I would estimate its speed at 20 mph.I tri! ed looki ng through my west facing window and watched the light as it moved to the neighbor's house directly behind mine and then northward out of view. I never heard of other reports and did not bring it up because it greatly disturbed me. I didnt sleep the rest of the night. I cannot stress how errie it was that there was no sound at all. Were there sound, everything about the incident would scream normal sheriff helicopter activity. There was just absolutely no sound at all, completly silent, and it seemed much lower than I normally observed local helicopters.

Although time has faded my memory of the exact date and time of this event.  I will attempt to re-account my sighting.  I was around 7 years old at them and it was in the evening perhaps in the spring/summer of 1976 and my parents, younger brother and I had stopped by a local McDonalds for a bite to eat.   We were eating inside our car in the parking lot when both my brother and I noticed a low flying rotating object flying over a strip mall across the street.  My parents dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter or something rationale, since Cecil Field was very close to this area,  but my brother and I were just fixated on this object!   The object was maybe 400-600 ft. up in the air as it flew over this strip mall moving from left to right in our field of vision.  The object was circular with multicolored lights (red, green, blue, etc.) around its edges, it rotated like a carousel with a slight tilt to the right and angled facing us so you could see it was circular.  I could see all the individual lights and the object itself rotating clockwise.  The object also had a single light on the top that illuminated a little bit of the surface around it.   We did not hear any noise that would suggest an airplane, helicopter or blimp.  We eventually lost sight of this object, but I was left very shaken and the event has remained etched in my mind ever since.

I thought it was a plane or helicopter, except it wasen't moving toward me or away from me. It did looked like it was slightly moving side to side a little but still staying in the same place. I thought maybe it was a meteror falling and waited for it to burn out as it came closer to the atmosphere. About 20 to 30 minutes went by and it still was not moving. I then went and got my binoculars to get a better look. As I focused on the light it was pretty wild, it was a triangle with a bright white light at each point and red was flickering in the middle. I watched this for about 10 minutes and still never moved. I went to put the binoculars up and as I came back it was gone. I was only gone for about 45 to 50 seconds. Now this is funny, I just went out to measure the time that I was gone and I looked out the window just now and there it is again. This time it's further away. I got my binoculars and could see it very clearly but it's now further away. I assume this is a star. It has white lights and the red light flickering in the middle. It's almost in the same spot as the other night. Just north of this light is another but to far to really tell. I hope I'm not crazy and sorry to waste your time if it is just a star. I'm not sure if I really believe in UFO's anyway, but it was and is pretty interesting.  Good luck,",

It just lookied like a huge wing. judging by the distance it was at, i beileve this ufo was miles long. A 747 flys a 32,000 feet. This object was in space and completely dwarved what planes look like in the sky. It crossed the sky in about 15 seconds. Within an hour this ufo was seen twice. Also, with and without the \"mothership\" there were massive formations. They were in Formations resembeling the \"mothership\". there were about 8 different goose like formations each consisting of 8 to 9 craft. to creat one massive formation. The awesome part was. When it was directly above us in the clearest part of the sky, you can actually see individual craft drifting in and out of formation. these formations crossed the entire sky south to north within 15 seconds.

I was looking at this one start in the western part of the sky when I seen a star shaped obect moving away from the star. At first I thought plane, but no blinking lights. What would further tell me it was not a plane is when 2 more lights kicked on and made a perfect equilateral triangle.  To ensure I was not seeing things I glaced elsewhere for about 10 seconds and returned to the object in question. To my amazement it was still there growing the distance between the star it originated from. After what seemed to be a minute the distance had grown extremly and the all 3 lights disappeared.  The lights were all white and in each corner of the equilateral triangle.I couls not make out anything else but the lights since it was so late but I could only guess the ship color had to be dark only because I felt like I was watching 3 stars move, but the fact they moved perfectly together with no change in distance from the other lights told me they were connected to a much bigger object.  I was not Fearful simply because if life does exist beyond ours i doubt with such amazing technology they would be coming to do harm to us. Truely an amazing sight.",

Shortly after 2200, I saw an object that was round to oval in shape I am unsure if it was tilted if at all. It was not emitting any light at first but a faint reflection of light pollution making its shape apparent. I was facing east; it passed by at about 20-30 degrees above the horizon moving from south to north. I noticed it first coming into sight from the right behind a few trees. It was in plane sight for approximately 90-120 degrees, for 5- 10 seconds.  For the last 3 seconds of my observation, it was emitting a neon-blue light. There was no apparent source of the light, meaning no visible bulb or bulbs, it looked like it was projected off of the surface or the surface itself was emitting the light in sporadic pulse. Only parts of it were making light, not the whole object, it was not in unison or uniform. It was like an imitation of lightening or the reaction to some form of stimulation, comparable to bio-lumination. It stopped making the blue light just before it fell out of sight behind more trees. It did not slow, stop, accelerate, or alter course for the duration of my observation.   I am within 5 miles of a municipal airport, and within 10 miles of a naval station, that holds near constant helicopter operations, this was not a helicopter, I have military training in identifying and reporting surface and air \u201ccontacts\u201d and identifying standard light configurations, I am very familiar with the helicopters I used to observe in the military and watch fly over the house every day and all hours of the night. It did not make a sound. I can only speculate the altitude of the object; it was low enough to reflect a very faint and dull light from urban lumination for the duration of my observation.",

Observation  from beginning to end would be approximately 7 to 8 seconds. There was no noise whatsoever, and the lights were not one right behind the other. They were at a distance of approximately 5 degrees and one behind the lead light was to the right offset to about 2 degrees.

I am a professional who works in the medical field radiologic imagery (not X-ray).  This incident occurred when I was 14 years old. It may seem strange to describe the exact circumstances of my observation, but you have to see this through the eyes of a teenager.  I had a cassette player which was the type that your regular portable unit which was about the size of an elongated cigar box.  My parent's house was about 5 blocks from the ocean.  At night, the next door neighbor would come over and she would sit at the dinner table with my mom and talk for hours.  So, to play my music and get away from my surroundings, I would take refuge by easily ascending to the rooftop by clmbing a palm tree via the ac unit. One evening after dusk, 9pm, I was listening to music, not to loud on the rooftop, when suddenly, the tape stopped playing.  At first, I thought the batteries died, but I could see the rollers were still moving.  I fiddled with the volume wheel, but it was not that either.  Perplexed, I sat there for a minute thinkin that the tape was bad or my player was going bad.  I honestly do not remember why I looked up, but I did.  Then I just leaned back and stretched my arms behind my head.  I noticed something odd, but I could not figure out what I was seeing.  Something to the east and to the North was moving. I saw a dark triangular object that looked to me at the time like a black hang glider up in the clear star lit sky traveling from North to South at a speed of maybe 300 mph or more.  It was dead quiet and it was definitely up there.  No lights but it was so clear out, that I could see its shape.  Now, Ironically later in life, it seemed to me to look more like an F-117 stealth in its overall shape, but this was in 1983.  Whatever it was, it profoundly etched itself in my memory.  About 30 seconds after traversing the peripheral of my view,  the tape player started playing music again. It was playing the song as if it had missed the part where the track was silent.  Before this incident, and after, I never had any problems with the tape or the machine, until I got rid of the player a few years later. I do not claim to have seen a UFO or a secret military craft.  But what I saw defied any satisfactory explanation to this day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

There were no flashing lights like I normally see on planes.

I followed these lights to the northern horizon but never saw any flashing.   When the light was to my north I noticed a plane crossing east to west.  I could clearly see the flashing lights on the plane and could hear its engine even though it was at a higher altitude than the light.  After the light passed out of view on the northern horizon I noted that were 2 other planes in the air at the time (one to my south passing east to west and the other to my west headed south -both headed toward birmingham) Both of these had flashing lights. I could also hear the engine of the plane to my south as it passed. All 3 of the planes were in \"normal\" flight patterns  (where I expect to see air traffic)- the light was not.

When it ran the last sequence of lights it seems to click in place and it disappeared.  The next day there were no signs in the yard where it was of any kind.

We have NAS planes fly over our homes many times a day. My 10 y/o daughter and I were in our parking lot looking at the stars. You could hear a military plane approching. It appeared across the parking lot flying very very low and slow for that time of night. If we were not familiar with these planes and it was not so low, I would not have figured out it was one. The plane had red and blue lights going all around it in a circle kind of blinking on an off as they went around. I could see the actual military plane, as it was so close. Following behind it, about 50 yards, was a very big bright white ball of light. I looked back to the plane to see how it was \"pulling it\" but I didn't see anything. The plane went over my building and the bright white light followed. We couldn't see it any more as our building was in the way. We never hear any sound other than the plane.

It looked like the pictures you see of meteors going across the sky, except this was at tree level, about the size of an average house in prospective to the trees, and was silent.  It was bright bluish-greenish in the front and red in the back, traveling from east to west.   I waited there in astonishment, waiting to hear a crash.  I was unraveled and ran inside to call our local TV station to report it. The next day, as I was explaining it to my neighbor, his teenage son saw it too!

It was probally a quarter mile from my location.  I could also make out a couple small dim white lights that seemed to be on the edges.  At one point it looked like it momentarily turned on some sort of spotlight for a few seconds and shined it on a large ship docked at the port.

I asked her to look at this painful bug bite for me on my neck and upon looking at it, she informed me that it was a burn and not a bite.  She said the burn was a triangular shape. A day or two later, I had my son take a picture of the triangular burn and upon relating what happened and expecting him to laugh at me, he immediately went to the computer and pulled up a very similar triangular mark on a male allegedly made by aliens when he was abducted. While I wasn't abducted, the uncanny similiarity of the two triangular marks, both appearing like arrowheads, leads me to be suspicious of what I really saw that night. It was a clear night, no clouds, stars could easily be seen, and there were no fires or any other instruments/equipment near me that could have burned me in such a manner.  I still have the scar on my neck as well as the pictures of the burn.",

However, I'm certian it was on a day between Feb. 10 and Apr 5, 2008.  I will describe the best I can.... I was in Jacksonville, Fl on the campus of Jacsonville U.  I saw a silent, dark, triangular object cruising at an altitude of no more than 1,000 ft and the length of each side appeard to be approx. 160 feet, give or take 20 ft.  I clocked it at bout 75-100 mph and was standing almost directly underneath its flight path (it was about 120 ft off to my left side) and there was a circular white light near each corner of the triangle (8-15 in diameter?). It was also headed North.  I didn't make a big deal about it to my friends cause theres no point and it's honestly not that shocking to me.  But it was awesome b/c that technology seemed eithr a good many evolutions ahead of the current stuff on the mass market or it was alien.  Either way ! O SHITson!!

One object appearing like an orange and yellowish round fireball, or meteor-like, started rapidly falling from upper left portion of window (about 10 o\u2019clock on a watch dial) towards the lower right of the window (or about 4 o\u2019clock).  After dropping to about 20 degrees off of the horizon to the lower right of my window, the object very quickly changed direction and shot off slightly to the right and away and disappeared over the horizon in kind of a bow shaped pattern following the contour of the earth at about 20 to 30 degrees. I would estimate the distance to the object was initially several miles from my viewing location, and was 15 to 20 miles away before disappearing over the horizon.  It initially appeared about the size of a golf ball from my vantage point, but was very small when it shot off and away to the right.  Total viewing time was a matter of a few seconds.  My wife was with me, but her back was facing the object when it appeared, and object was out of sight before she could turn to take a look at it. Event occurred the same night as the last launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery from Kennedy Space Center.  I have lived near Naval Air Stations in San Diego, and now Jacksonville, FL, and have observed numerous military aircraft, but have never seen an object like this, and seen it move and change directions so quickly.",

      "story": "Comet-like UFO. Major air surveilance at time of sighting. Two seperate crafts sighted. Thank You for your time. Please excuse this for its minor length. I saw two objects. The first object was heading north bound, actually flying across the little dipper constellation. The second object appeared immediately to the north when the first object flew over the tree line. The sky was clear and bright with stars. A few miles down my road is Historic Camp Milton. I looked on Google Earth a few months back and saw that they have an air strip. It is not uncommon to see helicopters flying a perimeter around the base.  So, I assume the base is active.  But there isn\u2019t much plane activity going in an out of Camp Milton. On March 6, 2011, at roughly 4:00 p.m., I was alarmed to hear low flying planes, so I went outside to have a look. I saw two radar planes, flying at least a mile apart, circling a huge perimeter around Camp Milton within 200 ft from tree level. I also noticed various planes at various clearances moving at various speeds, with the fastest I guessed was moving at around Mach 2. They were peppering the sky with activity. The spectacle of seeing so many planes in the air, with a lot of them moving in formation, was enough to be in awe over, or at least enough to make me question.  It also gave me a lot of things to compare my sightings to. So, I did question. I figured they were looking for something, so I kept looking up, hoping to maybe catch a glimpse of what they were searching for. These radar planes were circling for hours. At around 9 p.m. after checking the scene out a few times, I just stared up in no general area thinking something would catch my eye. That\u2019s when I saw the first UFO. This sighting lasted 3-5 minutes. It caught my attention much as a shooting star would, but it was moving much slower. Light put off was a constant when it was visible, but would fade in and out, much like a comet, but the trail lasted longer. The craft was still moving at a fantastic rate for its altitude. It looked as if it were among the stars. When it would appear, it would be further than I had saw it, but its position did not make sense in relation to its speed. It never blipped or blinked, only faded in and out in no apparent pattern. It took anywhere from 3 seconds to 10 seconds to reappear. Each time it appeared, it looked like a shooting star. I know it wasn\u2019t a meteor shower, because it kept a path. It was a yellowish light that had a haze to it, not a definite shimmer as a distant light might have within our atmosphere. It moved directly north, but after a few appearances, I lost it for around 10 seconds only to see it reappear, heading directly east and over th! e tree line. I was astonished, but saddened that I couldn\u2019t watch it for long. That\u2019s when a bright light caught my eye to the north. This sighting lasted around 10 seconds. The light from this UFO was blue, much like the new types of headlights for automobiles. It appeared and descended a little past Camp Milton, maybe a couple of miles above the tree line, which is within 8 miles from my house. The light was huge. I thought it was a helicopter, but it was moving much faster. The light had an aura, much like any flashlight shined in your eye, then it seemed to dim to as faint as a distant star, never blinking; remaining constant. It curved down, then flew off in a 45 degree angle, away from the horizon, until I could see the light no more. This sighting happened within 10 seconds, so I guessed that this craft was moving at a stellar rate of speed. There were no clouds in the sky at the time, so I was able to see it fade to nothing as it seemed to ascend into the sky. Both sightings combined happened within minutes. I stayed outside and kept watch. I noticed one other thing, which was a blip of light around Orion\u2019s belt, which I dismissed.. But then I saw that blip in the same spot. I could hear the planes circling on until midnight. I went outside for a late cigarette around 1 in the morning and there were NO PLANES IN THE SKY. I sat there for a while to try and see another plane, but there were none to be seen for my duration of looking at the sky. A thick fog rolled in around 3 in the morning. My rational explanation for the first sighting would be that it was a stealth plane. I may have saw its propulsion. I know they move at incredible speeds.  But, for the other, I have no guess. It was amazing.",

Both Pilots and I then continued our observation from my driveway.  I estimated its height at least 100,000 feet.

Not in the direction of our planets rotation, but rather racing back n forth, turning on 90 degree n less angle turns. Also swaying back n forth. The movement from here on the ground would travel to what appears up to be about 1\" to 1-1/2\" before turning or curving back around in a different direction. That doesn't sound like much distance but if you consider that these objects are in our atmosphere, a star moving 1-1/2\" in the sky must be a pretty good distance of travel. And the speed that they travel this distance must be great as well. They seem to be in patterns and holding there positions for the most part and have been there a while now.... As crazy as it sounds and appeared to me myself, I had to get some other person/s to see this as well to insure i wasn't seeing things. So I had my kids come out as well as a few of their friends to see these objects as well.. The did in fact see t! hem and noticed there movements just as I was... I myself do not the equipment or resources to film these objects, but believe someone should try to document them with a high powered telescopic/camera.

As he launched his bottle rocket off, something caught my eye.  I noticed an object flying what seemed to be a little to low for a normal airline plane. I noticed that it was slow moving and not shaped like an airline's aircraft and it had no exhaust trail and made no noise.  I pointed this object out to my brother and both of us were dumbfounded by this event.  Hat was most fascinating to me about this object is that it seemed to run an odd path in the sky and the atmosphere surrounding the object appeared distorted such as the heat waves you would see radiating off of hot pavement.  It didn't distort in a heat-wave type pattern though.  It was more of a pulsating visual as though it were bending light rays from its form of propulsion. The object seemed to be a dull metallic disk, with a smaller disk stacked on top of it, and it moved in a smooth elliptical path heading north before slowly, and gradually, decreasing in size until it finally disappeared.

It was shaped more like a ahort bullet and glowed reddish/orange/yellow as if it were extremely warm.  It was not a meteor.  It did not travel in a straight path but rather moved slowly on an angle, as if to steer it self a bit and then straighten out again.  I had enought time to call a witness to this from in the house. As the oject moved over head it appeared to pulse with this heat while it seemed like it was losing some of that heat.  It was moving slowly, like a slow helicopter speed.

      "story": "Three very bright orange lights above the tree lines traveling in the same pattern and direction. On Saturday night, my fiancee and I were sitting out on the front porch chatting.  Suddenly a very bright orange light caught my attention above the tree line on the opposite side of the street.  We both were astonished as we got up from the porch walking to the back of the house to keep the light in sight as it travelled over the house.  It appeared to descend and turn dark as it dissapeared behind the woods.  Just as we could no longer view it we turned and immediatly noticed two more identical lights travelling in the same pattern and direction as the first one.  The first of these lights seemed to have a haze over the top, and all were equally bright.  Immediately, we jumped into the car and attempted to follow these lights, however they dissapeared rather quickly.  My first thought was that perhaps they were associated with the military base, however I quickly realized that the only aircraft associated with the base are helicopters, and these lights certainly were not helicopters. I have seen the military aircraft every day of my life for the past thirty years, however have never wittnessed anything like this.  I believe the lights came from the west, were extremely bright, and made no sound.  As the lights appeared to be descending behind the woods they appeared to fade or darken and the shape seemed to be something of an elongated sphere.  I am not good with size or distance, however I would describe them as being the size of a smoke detector held at approximately two arms lengths.  Upon returning home, I called my Dad who happens to be a pilot and asked if he knew of any aircraft that had bright orange lights, he did not.  I also called my son as he is in the Air Force and asked him the same question.  His response was also the same.   I am still puzzled over what I have seen. Wish I had an answer.",

      "story": "Oval shaped craft with blunt ends no lights, completely black In early February, 2013, I stepped out my front door with my Jack Russell terrier so he could do his business one last time for the night.  As I recall, it was around 2200 and the moon was nearly full and there was some sporadic cloud cover. The front of my home faces east and it is located about twenty five miles west of the Atlantic ocean and about eighty miles north of Cape Canaveral. As I gazed up at the moon, I observed a dark, elliptical shaped object silently pass in front of the moon, almost blotting it out, and then disappear in the cloud cover.  I was able to view the object for approximately two seconds, as it crossed south to north.  It was hard to gauge its size, but the impression I was left with was that the object was very large; it was oval shaped in the middle, but the ends were blunt, or square. I quickly dismissed the object as being an aircraft because it had no wings or navigation lights.  The object was completely blacked out.  It was several days before I mentioned the sighting to my wife, who met my revelation with a very perplexed expression.  We\u2019ve been married for twenty three years and she served twenty of my twenty one years in the Marine Corps married to me, not to mention the past seven years that I have been a police officer, and my wife knows I am not easily impressionable, prone to exaggeration, or likely to joke about such things. Occasionally I have caught glimpses of shuttle launches from my front yard, but I truly cannot explain what it was that I saw that night in February.",

      "story": "reddish-yellow elongated diamond star-sized lights moving in elongated V formation against night sky that gradually disappeared I was just out in my backyard around 9:40 pm Saturday, February 8th looking at the evening sky-some low clouds, a clear moom, stars bright against the night sky.  And then I noticed these lights, as bright and slightly larger than the stars, the color of a lit match- something between red and yellowor, like a hot orange.  There were 5 or 6 of them moving steadily from right to left in an elongated V formaton at a moderately steady pace.  The one furthest to the right was highest with the next one slightly lower, the next lower still, the next dropping much lower, the next much higher and the last higher still. They weren\u2019t blinking or alternating color like lights from a plane, neither was there any noise like helicopters make.  I followed them as they moved across the sky until they were blocked by large tree, so I went out into the street to follow them and noticed two or three of them were gone.  I watched the ones remaining as they continued their path across the sky and noticed that one by one, from the right to the left, they were becoming fainter, losing color until they disappeared.  And then they were gone.. It was truly the strangest thing I\u2019ve ever seen and have no idea what they were.  I\u2019m not one for conspiracy theories and figure there\u2019s an explaination other than extraterrestial, but I\u2019m totally at a loss for what it is.  When I did a search online, I was shocked to find so many hits of similar sittings over the last year and from many locations across the country.",

It rose up and a lot of flashing lights went all around it the our eyes, but on video it shows a object of light shooting off of the one we was recording. It then started moving and stopping, and then lowered again. It came back up and stopped, and then flew away like and airplane would have been flying. This report will be on the local news Nov. 21st 2013. I have seen this object  1st in the north sky right above the tree level.  The 2nd sighting it was me and ((woman's name deleted)) and it was in the west sky, and again right above the tree level.  I called my mother, ((name of 2nd woman deleted)).  And the object moved alittle but that was it, and floated with the sky out of sight.  The 3rd sighting was in the south sky, right above the tree level.

I don't know how to explain it. Once they were in a row, the lights turned from red to orange and kept changing colors.  They never seemed to move but somehow disappeared.  We never heard any noises like we would have if it was a plane or several planes, which we hear often because we live in between a navy base and a commerce center for private/commercial planes.

I looked in the direction of the Kennedy space center as I often watch launches from there.  And there was indeed what looked like a rocket.  I enjoy trying to catch the take offs from my area when the weather is nice.  So I am usually familiar with what is taking off when because I try to watch for them.  (And sometimes photograph them)  I remembered that SpaceX had tried to take off early in the week and had been delayed but I thought it took off that night before on Dec. 3.    When I got home I did searches and could NOT find anything about any launches at Kennedy. I also checked the schedule of launches from Kennedy and other than one later this month there was nothing scheduled after the Dec. 3 SpaceX launch that had happened the night prio! r.  So after lots of digging I have yet to find anything about this launch.  My guess is it's unpublished NASA launch of a spy satellite or something.  But it definitely was a rocket launch and looked very much like it would if it were from Kennedy Space center. Also immediately after there seemed to be a lot of activity at the NAS Jax. (Tons of military jet planes) The area I was in 32256 is very close to the NAS base (just across the river from it), however, the \"launch\" was coming from the coast in the South eastern direction.  Again this is the exact direction I have previously watched many NASA launches. I did find, after lots of digging this video-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgRzshn_8QI&list=FLgk_WMPAW3xQhP2N9OtTnMA&index=1 .  It sounds and looks just like the launch I witnessed.  (Although I witness, obviously, from a much greater distance).  It was LOUD though even from our area.",

April 4th, 2014, I was about to return to work after lunch break was over.  I was walking in the door and glanced up in the sky to try and see if it looked like it was going to rain, a Black orb/oval shaped object caught my attention.  The object was flying across the sky horizontally towards the downtown area, the rate in which it was moving looked faster than any fighter jets that i have seen flying. The back object was moving rather fast, however there was no sound or flashing lights like airplanes, jets or helicopters have.  As the object was moving towards the direction of the downtown area (10-15 miles from my workplace), it appeared to rotate mid-air resulting in looking more narrow and smaller than it did when i first noticed.  After a couple seconds in this narrow appearance it rotated again and was back to the first observed shape. From the moment I initially saw the object until it was out of view lasted about 15-20 seconds. There were clouds covering the sky, and I am no expert of the distance of things, but it was well below the cloud line.  My guess is this object had to be between 1,000 feet - 2,000 feet in the air. I rushed inside work to tell my co-workers what I had seen only to get laughed at.  Within a minute of entering the building, my co-workers & myself heard what sounded like 2 fighter jets flying overhead & the sound of the jets was going in the same direction as the object. I do not know what the black orb/oval was that I saw.  The object made  No sounds,  No lights and a fast velocity, which was shortly followed by some fighter jets.  I can only describe the object as a U.F.O,  I'm not automatically assuming Extra Terrestrial, I just can't explain what the object was.",

At first I thought it might be a star, but as I drew closer I realized it could not be.  As I continued to travel along the freeway I was watching it and it did not appear to be moving.  I considered that perhaps it was a signal light on top of a cell phone tower or similar but I was not aware of any such construction in the area. As I got closer and it came clearly into view, it appeared to be triangular in shape and the size of a large plane.  It seemed to hover and didn\u2019t have any speed like an airplane or jet would.  There was also no audible sound coming from it.  Although I did not lower the windows on my vehicle, I feel sure that had it been a plane of that size I would have heard the roar of the engines. The other thing that struck me as unusual was that it appeared to have search lights on it.  They were very big and round and they faced down, towards the ground, not like the head lights of an airplane.  It did also have a red and green light on it which I understand is used to signal port and starboard on aircraft. I am not sure how many of these search lights were on this triangle as I did not count them, but I would guess at perhaps 6 or 8. I was unable to stop on the freeway, or to take picture whilst I was driving so I took the off ramp and drove around to where I normally park, hoping I would still be able to see it, however by the time I got around the building, I could no longer see the craft. I would very much like to learn what it is that I saw.",

I tried all types of medicines and finally gave up and went to the hospital.  After being diagnosed and given my prescription for antibiotics and pain meds, I went to a diner and had breakfast while I waited for the pharmacy to open.  At the diner I check my Facebook page and I read a message from my sister; Dad has cancer and is not going to do chemo.  Then crying.  Then pharmacy to pick up meds, call dad, he is too sick to talk, and eventually drive back home. I am one block from my house though and see this disc in the sky. It is a white disc, oval shaped.  At first I just thought, \"what a weird shaped cloud\", but then I realized it was moving.  I passed my house and continued down the street to catch a better glimpse of this thing.  I quickly reach for my phone to take a picture and it quickly flies away.   I park at Memorial Park on the river and try to look for it , but it is no where to be seen. This is the second alien sighting I've seen in the last 6 months, and last time I was with two other friends (all of us sober!) who saw it as well.  Last time it also happened that when we brought out our cameras it disappeared, but last time it was flashing different colors and it was also night time instead of daylight . Very interesting.",

At first I thought it was a helicopter. But the object moved so fast. It dove down and right back up and swirled around, way too fast and too bright to be a helicopter. It was not a plane either. I knew that from the start. It did not have the right shape or fly like one. As I turned on to Hodges blvd I continued to watch this light rise and fall in the sky. It would go way up in the air maybe 100 or 1000 feet and then fall right back down fast and zoom back up.  When I made it to my home my family got in the car with me and we drove toward beach blvd to try to find what it was. As we turned onto Hodges again we saw the ball of light zooming around.  It flew over the Windsor realty office and when we got in the turn lane to get closer it flew above our vehicle, about 10 feet above us. And then we pulled into Cape House and it zoomed away from us. It seemed to hover 20 feet away and above from us. I took out my camera phone and tried to get a video but the quality is horrible. As I started to film it I felt like it was watching us. It was so weird and then my husband took my phone from me and tried to zoom in on it and lost the light in the image. Then it zoomed up over the cape house office building. So we drove into Cape House Apts. Trying to ! find where it had gone but we never saw it again. We drove around for about 20 minutes trying to find it again. Got home at 9:20 PM. So It ended at about 9:00 PM.  We thought if it wasn\u2019t government or alien then maybe someone had a gas powered flying toy that they modified with blue/red/pink lights. I don\u2019t understand why no one else driving around noticed this thing and tried to find it too. It was so bright and flying so close and all over Hodges Blvd.  I want to say it was maybe a foot long of light but I couldn\u2019t get a good view of it because of the bright light. It was so fast. I have no idea what it is. The lights did not blink. It was like a bright ball of light maybe a foot wide. NO sound. After the ball disappeared a Plane came by flying kind of low and we wondered if that was government coming to find out what it was too. Or maybe the plane had dropped a drone in that area. I'm stumped. The light seemed clear but we couldn't tell what it was attached too couldn't see anything but the light.",

Being in  communication technologies I thought it was a radio tower but realized there were no towers by the house in this direction.  They were in a triangle formation.   The object that was flaming was the top left (east) of triangle.  The other two, one was to the right (west) horizontal to the flaimng one.  The third was below the other 2 and in a center position.   As  I turned left there were several couples with children walking , they were all looking and pointing at the objects.   As I ended the street I lost sight of the 3 objects due to trees and houses. I took a right turn an! d saw the flaming object still in the same place.  The other 2 objects were gone.   People walking on Blanding blvd were also looking and pointing at the object too.  I was not the only one who saw this.  The flaming one stayed stationary till I reached the next light.  The object was still flaming, then it moved toward the east at a fast pace and was gone.  It did not go away in a flash.

The lights then began to move slowly behind my house out of my sight to which I ran outside to see how far it had moved, and it was gone. I continued to watch the sky for about thirty minutes, as I was still stunned and shocked that the enormous light had disappeared so quickly.

      "story": "Smooth silver sphere in cloudless blue sky hovering at about 300 feet On a cloudless day, in the middle of the afternoon, I was in the backyard of my in-laws house by the pool, talking to my husband who was about 40 feet away in the yard.  I looked up to admire the sky and was surprised to see a silver sphere sitting stationary in the sky about 390 feet above me.  It was shiny silver, looked like a pinball from a pinball machine except it was a brighter metal, like silver.   I could not discern any movement at all as I watched it, saw nothing that appeared to anchor it, saw no exhaust, etc.  It was fascinating.   Having grown up with access to a naval base, I am familiar with military craft, and this was nothing like an aircraft.  It also did not resemble any craft I have seen out of NASA, and did not resemble a balloon, blimp, or any other known craft I could think of.  If anything, I thought maybe it was a new type of drone, but I haven't seen a military or civilian one that was a perfect sphere like this was.   I turned to call my husband! so he could witness it and when I looked back up maybe a second later it had vanished.  No contrail, no clouds to disappear into, fairly open horizon, and I searched the sky trying to locate it again, but it was nowhere to be seen.  I have never seen a plane vanish that quickly.   It made no sound, I observed no lights or color changes, may have had a slight haze around it, but if so it was so minor it caused little to no distortion of the craft or air surrounding it.  I did not feel threatened by it, more surprised and curious.   There had been a plane that passed by at a much higher altitude and at a different point in the sky several minutes earlier, but it and its contrails were already gone, and I saw one or two several minutes later, and the were also at higher attitudes at different points and had contrails.   Date and time of day are not exact because I didn't report it right away.  We were not using electronics so observed no issues with them.

At the time, I was using a magnification of about 100X with a # 21 orange filter.  Although the rising moon was still low in the SE, seeing was quite good, and there were no clouds or haze. While observing features on the lunar terminator near Mare Serenitatis, I noticed a fast moving, solid black pentagon-shaped object traversing from west to east [moving from the terminator roughly in the direction of Mare Imbrium] across the lower (mid-northern) portion of the moon.  The estimated time of passage before it swept out of the eyepiece\u2019s field of view was \u2013 my best guess \u2013 well under five seconds.  As I was not wearing a watch, I immediately went inside and looked at a wall clock (known to be accurate within a minute or so), and recorded the time. The most unusual aspect of this observation was the shape of the object.  Because it swept across the field of view so rapidly, I am not 100% sure that I am getting this exactly right, but my recollection is that its silhouette was something between a pentagon and a five-pointed star, as shown on the accompanying drawing.  This rendering is based on a quick pencil sketch that I made within a few minutes of seeing the object.  The thing that sticks in my mind is that this object was inky black and perfectly symmetrical \u2013 with no change of shape or tumbling effect as it crossed the face of the moon. As to the object\u2019s size, I have tried to relate it to some of the named lunar craters in this area, and \u2013 again, to the best of my ability \u2013 it seems to have had an apparent angular size midway between that of Menelaus (27 km) and Manilius (39 km), so my best guess would be an apparent size of about 30 km, as projected against the lunar disc. Based on its eastward trajectory, moving roughly in line with the ecliptic, my suspicion is that this is some kind of large, earth orbiting satellite \u2013 but what could it be?  Although I have never witnessed a lunar transit by the International Space Station, I am familiar with its appearance, both as it has been imaged in telescopes and as it has been photographed traversing the moon, but the object that I observed looked noting like this. Has anyone else seen anything like this? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides very nice illustration of what the object looked like in the field of view of his telescope.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter -- Thanks for your follow-up email on the report that I submitted this morning.  You wrote: \"You do state in your report that the object appeared to be moving from west to east.  Am I correct in assuming that your statement implies west to east, as the witness faces the Moon, and not as he is looking at the (reversed) image in the telescope?  I think your drawing pretty well answers my question, but I would like to be certain on that point.\"  Yes, you are correct, moving from west to east across the face of the moon as shown in the diagram.  In my reflector's eyepiece view, everything is of course inverted but not mirror reversed, and I corrected for this in the drawing.  Always confusing.  One of these days, I am going to get a good penta-prism so I can get non mirror-reversed views in my refractor, lol. Of perhaps more interest, I shared my report with a friend, a retired aerospace engineer [His wife is a retired aerospace engineer, too, lol.] who was able to take the data -- with a few assumptions about a probable earth orbit height -- and perform the following simple calculations: ((calculation)) Hello ((witness name deleted)), You don't need trig for this one, just algebra. 30km (object)/ 376364km (Earth, Moon Distance - surface to surface) =  X/200 miles.  Solving for X, we get .0159 miles which at 5280 ft/mile  gives a size of approximately 84 feet, about right for a large spy  satellite or old booster tank.  Likely just more space junk. ((name deleted)) PS. You may find this site interesting. http://www.stuffin.space/ Click  on an object to see what it is. Hummmm.  84 feet is not as large as I thought it might be, but it would seem to \"fit\" the data pretty well  I remain puzzled by the odd symmetrical shape, but perhaps this is the way that some satellites are constructed.   Anyway, thanks again for the follow-up on the report.  My feeling is that we have now, most likely, gone from a \"UFO\" to an earth satellite, albeit of unknown origin, lol.   PS--Yes, you have my permission to post the drawing, and -- if possible -- it might be interesting to post Richard's back of the envelope calculations as well as a postscript, so long as there is no need to specifically identify him. PPS--I always enjoy hearing your segment on Coast to Coast, and hearing about what other people are seeing in the sky these days.  As I have mentioned to you, my only \"real\" UFO observation was made back when I was a kid -- almost sixty years ago, now.  The truly amazing thing is how much data has been gathered about this phenomenon over all of the intervening years, but how little we still seem to know about what it all really \"means.\"   Clear Skies -- ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2)) Hello Peter --        As for my friend's calculations, you are correct, there was indeed some bootstrapping involved, lol.  At my suggestion, he made the assumption, as a starting point, that the object was in low earth orbit at an arbitrarily chosen altitude.  Then, he applied the simple geometric calculations that you see to get its approximate size.           Obviously, if the object was not in this type of orbit -- in a higher orbit, or much closer to the lunar surface -- then it becomes much larger, and far more problematic in terms of an explanation.  The limiting case would be a huge object -- on par with the diameter of a moderate sized lunar crater -- flying at incredible velocity over the face of the moon.  Think Independence Day II, lol.        On the other hand, its [unhappily, not very well] observed transit time can also serve as a geometric limiting factor.  That is, if something is seen to cross the entire face of the moon in, say, five seconds, then this (from the application of simple geometry) gives us a strong indication about where -- and how fast -- it must be moving relative to the earth and the moon.  In this case, all of the parameters, working backward, seem to \"fit\" the more mundane explanation that this is some kind of earth satellite, but it still might not be... Going Down the Rabbit Hole        As I mentioned in my last email, the most interesting / deeply troubling aspect of all of this is that most of us -- you, me, and the Coast listenership -- seem to be struggling to come up with some kind of logical, rational, and more or less coherent and comprehensible \"model\" of what the UFO phenomenon is all about and what it might actually \"mean\" in practice.  Sadly, this is not the model that \"our\" government seems to be pursuing -- cf, the contributions of everyone from Richard Dolan to Dr. Steven Greer -- and we never seem to get much closer to a real understanding of what is happening.        As I remember you observing many years ago, such a deliberately orchestrated denial / obfuscation of reality is absolutely toxic to our form of representative government, and this would help to explain everything from the pent-up anger of the public [The Brits seem to have voted to leave the EU yesterday.] to the near total dysfunction of Official Washington.  We are, at best, living in a carefully manufactured official reality where very little is what it appears to be, including the sundry aerial phenomena that you record every day, and yet nothing much is \"done\" about it.        Unlike the more optimistic assessment of Dr. Greer and others, my fear is that we live in a world in which anything like official disclosure (or even a simple confession of ignorance as to the exact nature and purposes of the phenomenon) may never occur, and The Powers That Be will simply do whatever is necessary to make sure that their version of reality \"sticks,\" even though an increasing majority of citizens know better.  How our present system of government can survive such a dual reality in which everyone knows that its public officials are lying in their teeth about important things is open to question*, but it took quite a while for the Soviet system to implode, and TPTB now have much better \"tools\" with which to mold / coerce society**. *As seems to be taking place in the election of 2016, lol. ** See, for example, Jane Mayer's recent book, Dark Money. As a number of people in the field of ufology seem to be calling for at this point [Many of these people have appeared on Coast and in other venues.], perhaps the best that we can do is to continue creating a citizen-sourced, distributed network model type of investigation that simply gives up on the idea the gov'mint will ever come clean with the public in this area.  Instead, we will, I hope, end up with something like a Wikipedia of UFO-related material that will constitute (for most people, probably) a viable alternative to the manufactured \"reality\" that the government and / or TPTB continue to shovel in our direction.  Then, based on this open, public consensus version of reality, perhaps we can begin to \"do\" something--whatever this might turn out to be--about our objective situation vis a vis the things that everybody keeps seeing in the sky. Thanks, as always, for your help with this -- ((witness name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #2))",

It initially appeared to be moving slightly downward and was thought to be just that, a meteorite.   It then appeared to level out ever so slightly, still at very high altitude.  It had a Southern heading.   As it was tracked visually, its abnormal shape became more apparent.  The chevron-like outline was the only part that appeared to glow (now a white/blue) and thus was clearly visible, but the interior portion, while difficult to make out, was definitely opaque (making the object a triangle rather than just a chevron).   Just before the object left line of sight, it abruptly and instantly changed direction and increased speed, heading East, toward the Atlantic coastline.  There was no trail, haze, or sound throughout the duration of this sighting. As a military veteran, I initially suspected some sort of stealth craft upon recognizing the unnatural shape, but nothing in the United States military arsenal (that is known publicly or that I've seen during my time in service) can travel that fast or instantly change direction at such speeds. This was my first unidentified flying object sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

Almost every night, a large orange orb in the sky that is located above Craven road off Sunbeam Road in Jacksonville, Florida.  A planet does not move at will nor do stars while this orb does.  I looked at it one night and thought to myself, if this thing is satanic, evil, it has to do what I say, as that is what the bible says.  So, I looked at and \u201cthought clearly\u201d, \u201cMove away from me if you are evil. \u201cHere\u2019s the weird thing; It did just that. It has two orbs below it that blink constantly.  One blinks dark blue and light blue and the other blinks red, white and green.  The red white and green orb has actually moved on its own, much like a drone, but there are no drones that look like it.  This orb has a saucer shape but you can only see an outline as if it is covered in camouflage paint, it blends with the night sky.  Again, there are no drones that are like this.  It is the size of a very large helicopter but completely quiet, not even a whistle sound like a drone would make. They seem very curious about the people in the apartment complexes on Sunbeam Road for some reason as well.  I have observed a figure with only an outline walking by one of the buildings that looked too skinny and small to be a human. Shaped like a grey but, with a smaller head, barely visible.  These orbs seem to enjoy being near the hill located by Sunbeam Road across from the veterinarian hospital but they have moved location, sometimes sitting above the post office in front of the trees.   There is also an isosceles Triangle located above Sunbeam Road that changes locations quite often and has an odd rounded shape at the bottom. I get a very creepy feeling when I look at it, almost like someone is staring at me.  I have made the attempt to create a drone to fly towards the red, white and green orb, I call it Italy, but, I am stuck trying to figure out a good power source to fly that far.  I also do not want it to destroy or take my drone nor assume it to be a hostile attack.  It has flown directly over a plane one night, very slowly, showing its size.",

Just West of Hodges Blvd. on Beach Blvd. in the Wolf Creek housing development, Jacksonville, FL.  Two bright orange lights in South-Western sky.  They were separated horizontally at about 45 degrees and maybe a mile or so vertically.  The bottom light was to the left of the top light.  I watched them for a few minutes and the bottom light started moving to the right.  When it was almost lined up with the top light, the top light started to move South-West very rapidly.  The bottom light started moving South-West also a few seconds after the first.  They both moved extremely fast and disappeared in the distance. I left the spot where I first spotted the lights and drove about two minutes or so to another part of the housing development.  I made a right on another road and the two objects were back in the same part of the sky.  I drove back to the original spot. They were arranged different.  The top one was to the left of the bottom. They sped off tho the South-West again.  Amazing!  The second time I saw them, there were two other people watching the lights.  We did not speak. Later that night I saw at least 8 more orange orbs moving though the sky.  They could have been Chinese lanterns, but they were not flickering like there was a flame.  The were solid orange and very bright.",

It didn't have the lights on the bottom that I have read about but it did have some faint lights around the perimeter and they were blue.  I live about 6 miles north west of NAS-JAX and it came from that direction so I assume it is very possible this was a military aircraft but it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that they would fly secret craft over very populated areas.  Anyway it was moving very slow and you could really only even make it out, at first, because of the perimeter lighting.  I am no aeronautical expert by any means but it was certainly lower than the normal craft we see flying around here (but I don't know what that elevation is...) I am going to guess that it was at around 8 to 10k feet.  This just happened so I am a little excited, I apologize if I am skipping around. After a couple of minutes it got brighter - significantly brighter - and then sped away very, very quickly - still heading north-west.  I only even went outside because my dogs were barking at the door yet no one was there.  I didn't even think to mention that until I got to the part of your form that asked if animals noticed.

My girlfriend noticed a bright star over one of the trees and pointed it out to me when we got out there but I insisted we look at the moon first.   After observing various objects in the sky approximately 15 minutes after my girlfriend noticed the bright star, I looked up and found the star, and proceeded to tell her I was going to try and locate it in the telescope.  We observed the bright spherical \"star\" for another 10 seconds before I turned to move the telescope.  We both took our eyes off of it for no more than 5 seconds and as I looked up the star was gone!  It was not a shooting star (wouldn't have stayed there for 15 minutes), not a satellite (once again wouldn't be up there that long in the same exact spot), what does th! at leave?  The event was one of the craziest things I've ever witnessed.",

      "story": "Fast moving, black star-shaped object seen transiting the moon at 144X magnification. Another Lunar Fast Walker?  While observing the moon last night with a three inch (80 x 900 mm) refractor, I saw a black, star-shaped object transiting through the eyepiece field of view at approximately 17:57, EDT.  [Please see the attached diagram for more details.]  I was observing the Aristarchus - Herodotus area of the moon--near the lunar terminator at this time--with a star diagonal and a magnification of 144X .  The waxing gibbous moon was rising in deep twilight, and seeing was excellent.  At the time of the sighting, I had just switched to a 12 mm eyepiece with a 2X Barlow, and just as I was coming to focus with this combination I glimpsed a black, five-pointed, star-shaped object transiting from right to left through the eyepiece field of view (FOV). All of this happened very fast--probably in less than 1 second--and my impression is that when I first saw the object it had already begun to cross the FOV, and I was only able to observe it as it moved toward the left side of the image.  Again, please see the associated diagram for more details.  Note that since I was using a star diagonal which gives a mirror-reversed image, the object was actually moving from east to west--the opposite of what is shown in the eyepiece view. As a point of interest, this is actually the second of these objects that I have seen while observing the moon.  The earlier observation took place on June 23, 2016, and there is a report on file with NUFORC.  As memory serves--and going back to my earlier report to confirm my recollection--this is exactly the same type of object that I observed last year, and moving in the same east to west direction. As I am at best a \"casual\" (as opposed to a systematic) observer of the moon, I am wondering about the reported frequency of sightings of objects of this type.  Given that I have now seen two of these within the space of a year and a half, it would seem to me that others must also be seeing them.  But what is it, exactly, that I and presumably others are seeing?  ((name deleted)) Jacksonville, FL",

My understanding of these sightings in the past to me have been that these people must be of not sound mind.  Simply put that has changed.  I now have been a witness and through thorough online research have found many other conversations of this nature.  My wishes in this letter are that I bring to attention a possibility of a defense flaw in our technology, also a possibility to learn from their designs as well as seek video evidence which will allow a reverse engineering if possible of the technologies in which they use. I went outside at 3:48 am 10/13/2017 at 30\u00b015'58.5\"N 81\u00b044'01.4\"W I saw clear as day a diamond shaped object with a blunted rear.  Large cylindrical shaped matte green lights were similar to doughnut shaped circles that were phosphorescent but did not emit any light pollution outside of the light itself or within the center.  I believe this was caused due to a magnetic field as the light would normally have emitted a void within the center.  It was not far I would estimate 500ft up at most or whatever the ceiling height of the cloud cover was.  About 200 ft away to the SW.  Size of about six houses maybe as large as twelve in mass.  I was awestruck at the magnificence and engineering that went into it.  I could see the louver like body on the craft and the design was like plates were set similar to a red clay roof as if the heat was dispersed by the space behind each plate.  The sound may be in the video however my ac unit could have caused that.  I would pass any lie detector test on this I am 100% certain of what I saw. I am going to do my best to have an image rendered.  I could pass a lie detector test on this. I was not open minded on this and grew up in Bermuda.  I am now very interested and am setting cameras up to record any anomalies. I have video however it may need some editing to be able to get a clear view of what I saw.

      "story": "Driving down the road, we noticed a triangle formation of 5 extremely bright Balls of light hovering in place in the sky.  To the left of formation or our right there were three separate light orbs moving at a high rate of speed towards the main formation which was holding position, to the other side of the formation was a single one closing in on the main formation as well.  The craft appeared as incredibly bright balls of light flickering in and out a orange color.   As I started video recording, the 3 separate craft moved very fast and completely silently at a low altitude approximately 500 to 1000 feet in heigth and joined with the main triangle formation, at that point all the lights began to move north and faded out.",

On September 10th, at 12:30am, traveling home to Jacksonville, FL, from a vacation on the west coast of Florida, we noticed a bright light in the air over the St. Johns River.  We were traveling east on 295 about to go over the Buckman Bridge in Orange Park about to enter Jacksonville.  The light was bright orange traveling north then upward, it looked like a bright orange Nike swoosh, then turned into a white light.  At first I would have thought it to be a meteorite, but it was traveling along the circumference of the earth and made an abrupt change straight up, almost a 90 degree turn.  Then it changed colors from a bright orange to a white light.  My wife, two daughters and a friend all saw this light.",

      "story": "Disc or circular objects with colorful lights moving erratically high in the sky. Tonight and on many different occasions one to three colorful disc shaped objects have been seen hovering high in the sky. One is always in the center moving slowly side to side and up and down, its seems to be larger than the others.  Sometimes it is alone, but on most occasions it is accompanied by two to three smaller ones . The smaller ones are also multi colored, and move erratically in circles and side to side around the larger one.  The movement is very erratic at times not like any air craft I have seen. They really put on a show, with the blinking and rotating lights.  It usually last a few hours. They are so high in the air, if they were still you would think that they were stars. This happens several times per month, five miles east of the Little Rock Air Force Base, around the Kerr station road/South Bend area.
