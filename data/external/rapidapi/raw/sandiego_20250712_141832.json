A flame that was moving from west to east was coming toward our position, directly overhead.  It was moving slowly, and seemed to be approaching us.  At one point, we asked each other if it was falling from directly above us, down toward us.   It was very large (looked like the fire that comes out of a hot air balloon but bigger) and slowly floated above us, in the same west-east direction.  It looked like it could have been only 100 meters above ground at the closest point.   It then gradually moved away from us, getting smaller and smaller, as if it was moving further from the Earth as it moved eastward.  This continued until it turned into a small red light and disappeared.  The red light at the very end looked like a small red star.   By the end we were not looking as easterly as we were looking up at the sky.  From our vantage point it seemed to move very slowly while it approached us (like a hot air balloon) and very quickly as it moved away from us (like a jet or rocket).  Nothing we could imagine could seem to be so close, and in just a matter of seconds be so far away.   The entire episode lasted 3-4 minutes, most of which was time it spent approaching and floating above us, always moving in the west-east direction.",

First, there was one, which we thought might be a light.  Looking from the Poway area, it was Southwest and at the same star location as the Menkent star cluster. It faded away without moving after 5 minutes, but then reappeared in the same spot with a second light around a minute later.  These stuck around for another 5 minutes, or so, faded, and then reappeared with 3 lights, in the same spot. The three lights stayed for about 10 minutes.  During this time, they shimmered in different patterns, then faded away.  After less than a minute, one appeared above and to the right of the original location, stayed a minute, then faded, and soon after two appeared, below the previous but above the original location.  They faded as well, and that was it. There was a heavy Marine layer at the time, so no other stars were shining through, but these were abnormally bright, much brighter than the city lights in the distance though appearing to be just as far.",

It moved very slowly across the sky from NE to SE for about 25 minutes.  At times it disappeared behind the high clouds and then reappeared.  It reflected the sun's light the entire time.  I took 59 photos of the \"dot\" in the sky.  When magnified the object was as follows: bright silver cylinder with a donut shaped object attached on top of one end of the cylinder.  My various photos showed different views of the object, so indeed it was turning around both horizontally and vertically.  My wife and neighbor both witnessed this sighting.  I verified with the local military air installation that they did not see that object even though it appeared to be above MCAS Miramar at one point.",

      "story": "2 lights hovering around south san diego, bordering tijuana. H1, although this event occured roughly 2 years ago, I felt that I wanted to share my story after watching a few documentaries of UFO's on television.  To begin, my family had a small get together at my house for dinner, and after we were just hanging out with my younger nieces and nephews playing video games. After the games, my cousin and I went out for a walk in my street, it was about 9-10 pm. Just about 2 houses away from my house, something from the sky caught my eye. I looked up and I saw 2 spheres(?), can't clearly classify it because the objects were far away, however they were clearly visible due to their illumination. After spotting the objects, I looked at my cousin, in which he was staring at it in the same amazement as well. Having to be skeptics of everything, i quickly suggested that it was an airplane or star of some sort. However, my theory was proven false after 10 minutes of staring at the objects. See, we've always noticed that airplanes have blinking lights, however these objects did not have any. Another thing, these objects moved in a wierd manner that they were like chasing each other. Also, after moving fairly fast, (unfamiliar to our eyes )they would just stay in place and be stationary for a minute or 2. Later they would resume moving around. Having to be a bit scared, my cousin and I were satisfied that these were UFO's. However, it doesnt stop here. After 10 minutes, the objects would suddenly dissappear in a flash, either they migrated in the speed of light, or they just turned off all their lights. So my cousin and I were looking everywhere, and still no sign(let me note, it was a clear night no clouds). 30 seconds or a minute later, they would reappear again and do the same routine, they would chase each other around and then stop all of a sudden and hover in the air. However it gets even wierder, one of the objects shoots some kind of light(laser), in which the light dissappears after a while it has been shot. We were thinking, that either the object shot the light towards the other object, or towards the ground, i don tknow, because like i said the light dissappears after a while it travels in the air. After all this they become stationary again, and all of a sudden one of the objects flashes away into the sky, and the other one follows. (again in such a speed, not familiar for us to observe). The whole siting took about 20 minutes, and those 20 minutes were standing in the same exact spot that we were, when we first spotted them. And believe me, after we saw those UFO's my cousin and I were still in awe of what we just saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the alleged event occurred sometime in 2004.  Does not specify exact date.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in 2004.  PD))",

It stayed in one location for a couple of seconds then darted over us heading north.  The craft made no noise and there was no traffic in the area or any other noise...very odd because of the proximity to MCAS Miramar.  The shape seemed to be similar to the stealth plane, a triangular shape, black, with large lights on the underside toward the front.  One light was under the pointed nose with two or three lights on both sides, angled with the shape of the plane.  I believe the aircraft had lights on the upper side as well because of the soft light above it.  The lights were not spotlights; they did not cast a beam.  I emailed a local news station with a half hour of the sighting, but never received a reply.  Nothing was ever reported in the news, so I am unable to confirm if others saw it as well.  Something else was very unusual:  the news did report that San Diego's commercial airport, Lindburg Field, was closed for a time due to fog.  Odd, because there was no fog that night.

Some night toward the end of July I don\u2019t remember the exact night but me my friend and two girls were listening to music on our balcony of the house we rented. All of a sudden a bunch of the street lights went out and a lot of houses went black too as if there was a blackout and then I turned around and I saw a slight white flash or white bright object in the sky and then a beam of light and then it was gone and shortly after that all the lights came back on. This happened on South Mission beach area. It was very strange I don\u2019t know what it was but all I know is it was like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen. It was definitely very strange. It moved very fast it disappeared in no more than 2 seconds. It was a roundish in shape I guess u could say but I couldn\u2019t really tell if it was a bright object or a flash. The sky was pretty clear that night too and there was a slight breeze if I remember right, if that helps at all. But what I witnessed that night was very odd and I will not forget it.

I had eaten pizza at one of my favorite places about an hour prior, so I wasn't having low blood sugar or anything like that.  I have no know medical conditions (i.e. macular degeneration, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.) that could possible account for my observation.  I hadn't had any alcohol, nor any other drug (prescription/recreational) substance, nor do I have a history of using any such substance.  I don't wear corrective lenses and I have really good night vision. I am alert & orientated as to person, place, and time.  I believe this statement is given to the best of my knowledge and of my own free will, without seeking any personal gains.  I feel strongly enough about my experience as to overcome any and all concerns / reprocussions that might arise out of my making this statement.  And, I had washed my car earlier that day so the windshild was unobstructed! I was proceeding East bound on Route 52E just prior to the Regents road off ramp.    I could see military planes in the pattern at Miramar Air Station. I noticed a white light at approximately 2 O'clock middle (not high or low).  The light appeared to be between me and Miramar.  Initially the light appeared to be stationary and looked like a star and then it took off and I saw it start to accelerate at an incredibly fast rate of speed until it was out of sight.  All this happened in less than a second.  I was flabbergasted and I had to pull over to the right shoulder and come to a stop just prior to the exit sign.  I have taken three semmesters of Calculus based college Physics and I am familiar with Newtonian mechanics as well as optics, and I have taken the Nikon school of photography.  I am a primary health care provider.  Prior to this sightening I was a disbeliever in UFO's.  I've seen numerous shooting stars, I am familiar with the F-18 Hornet, F-14's, F-15's and numerous other Fighter & civilian plane/jet flight characteristics.  I've seen missle test flights, and NASA rocket launches.  I solomonly sware that I can't account for this visual sightening based on any of my life's experiences.  It wasn't an optical illusion or reflection or something that can be explained on my perspective in relation to its course of motion.  And, it was traveling at such a high rate of speed that I can't even conceive of anything going that fast!!!  I don't know if it is a space ship or whatever it is but I can tell you that it had enough of an impact on me to motivate me to make this report which I wouldn't ordinarily do unless I think it was pretty significant!  Because it went from a stand still to an acceleration it is difficult for me to explain its flight characteristics as a natural phenomen.  I would say that it is a UFO.  The was no visible trail nor any sound coming from it that I could hear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

I see so many strage things that I dont even tell anyone any more,  people are naturally skeptics.  I still have the videos if you will like to talk.  Last night at 2am,  I saw yet another strange sighting.  Went to smoke in my back yard,  always looking up at the sky...cause I really cant help myself anymore.  Didnt really notice anything strange..except the could were moving really fast & I could tell it was going to rain(it's raining today).  When I went back into my room as soon as I hit the bed I noticed a bright red light falling straight down from the sky.  While outside i just had a feeling I would see something for some strange reason.  As soon as I saw the light I yelled to my lady to wake up and look...indeed she saw it to.  As soon as she looked a second red light came behind it like is was following it.  We watched the light as they moved and danced until we could no longer see them.  They looked like they were coming to land on the ground,  however the rooftop of the neighbors house blocked the view.  After we could no longer see them,  me and my lady just layed back down,  neither one of us could stop staring out of the window.  I've seen many unexplained things over the last 5 months,  but this one got my heart rate pumped way up.  After we layed there for a minute,  my lady said did you nitice that there was no sound.  Minutes later an airplane flew overhead.  We both agreed that what we saw was no air plane.",

I was driving on Clairemont dr heading south bound. It was about 9:30pm at night and Clairemont dr was pretty quite. I think I was the only person on the road at the time.  As I came around a bend in the road I saw a gold bright light... I did a double take cause I thought it was the police helicopter that normally is flying around my area. I couldnt make out what the object was. I noticed no other lights and the police helicopter has two lights... red and green and I didnt see those. When I first saw the object I was looking about 200 yards to my right out of my trucks winshield.  as I got closer and realized that the object was not a helicopter I then thought it was an airplane but the sky was over cast and it would have been impossible to be an airplane flying that low.  I started to feel very nervous cause I couldnt make it out. All this happened so fast that I was unable to figure out what to do.  I continued driving and I kept glancing up at the object. It didnt move an inch. When I came right up on it I noticed it was about 3 telephone poles in height in the sky.  It wasnt very big, but it was bright like a like was hanging in the sky. I lost sight of it as a drove by it. I slowed down and was trying to look at it out the back of my truck window but the furniture was in the way. I got a little further down the road and could see the spot where I saw the light over the furniture in the back of my truck and I didnt see it anymore. It was gone.  I decided to go ahead and continue to dump off the furinture and when I came back Clairemont drive I decided to go driving around the back streets where I saw the object and I came to the cayon rim and I noticed something flying around.  I thought for sure this time I was looking at a helicopter flying around La Jolla mountain. I was facing north at a dead end of a back street. I then noticed the supposed helicopter was making very sharp turns and speeding up and slowing down real swiftly.  I knew I wasnt looking at a helipcopter. It was something else.  I lost sight of this object and so I got back on Clairemont dr and continued toward my house heading north. I spotted the object again. I watched move around the sky. It was covering a distance of 2-3miles in seconds as it went around in no given pattern.  It was flying low to the ground beneath the cloud cover. When I got close to home I made a left turn and I lost sight of the object for good. I told my wife when I got home. I went out side and smoked a few times throughout the night but I didnt see the object again.",

This evening, Saturday, October 27, 2007 at 7:48 Pacific Time, I saw 4 lights, shaped in a tight V-shape (2 on each side), fly across the sky from North to South almost directly over me; but passing slightly east of my location.  I was in a dark area near the corner of Convoy and Armour Streets in San Diego, California.  This area is directly under the flight path of Montgomery Field and a few miles south of Miramar Marine Air Station.  I have lived around the Miramar Marine Air Station for 20 years in several locations.  I have seen just about every possible plane and plane formation flying over me in this area and I have never seen anything like this.  Each light was about the 3 or 4 times the size of a normal star (so they were very obvious). A plane close enough to have a light that large would be very loud; but there was no sound.  The distance between each light was about the same as each light (making it seem like all 4 lights were linked) but I could not see anything in-between the lights.  This was a tight formation.  This V-shape of lights traveled from north to south across two-thirds of the sky in about 5 seconds  (5 seconds is not a quick glance---I watched it clearly).  Tonight, at 7:48 pm, there was about 10 to 20 percent of wispy cloud cover and these lights were above the clouds; but I do not know how high above the clouds.  I could see the lights through the clouds as they passed over the clouds.  The quality of the lights needs mentioning.  The lights were solid and bright; but not a bright light like a star or blinking plane light.  These lights were different, maybe softer.  These lights did not blink. I guess the best description of these lights would be a slightly dim, off-white.  I say they were a V-shape; but the open end would be wider than a typical V.",

I told my daughter to turn around and look at these lights that were in the sky off the coast. I knew that it wasn't a plane because planes aren't stationary in the sky, and it was too low in the sky to be a star, there was no sound, and the  lights were red on top and yellow on the bottom, close together, one light on top of the other light. We kept walking on the pier and continued to look back at the lights. All of a sudden there were no more lights in the sky. We just went down the stairs, got into the car and drove home. Of course, we talked about the lights on the way home, and speculated about what it could have been, but it wasn't until I started hearing about reports of lights in the sky in Phoenix, and the documentary about UFO's on the Discovery Channel that I'm watching right now, that I felt compelled to report the incident.

      "story": "Something very large and silent passed overhead - heard but not seen. January or February 1974.  I did not see a craft, but certainly heard something.  I was attending school at the Naval Training Center (NTC) in San Diego.  I had seen a movie (The Neptune Factor) and was walking back to the barracks.   Passing through a parking lot, I heard a tremendous sound - imagine something the size of a 747 passing 100 feet overhead with its engines shut down.  It was not the wind...  I have spent quite a bit of time outdoors and know it was not something like that.  Being a glider pilot, I know the sound that aircraft make when they fly without power - and it was almost like that, but 100x louder than any sailplane.  When this happened, I stopped and looked up.  Unfortunately, there were bright lights in the parking lot and I could not see if the stars were obscured.  NTC is directly in the flight path of Lindberg Field.  But if this was an airliner gliding to a landing at the airport, it never would've made it.  I thought perhaps I was hearing things, until I looked across the parking lot and saw another sailor, standing still and looking straight up.  I walked over to him, and he asked me, \"What the hell was THAT?\"  I asked him what happened, and he described back to me exactly what I experienced. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the source of this report for his having submitted such a excellent rendition of what he experienced aurally.  We wonder whether he might have been aural witness to the vortices, which are generated in the atmosphere at the wing tips of aircraft.  They descend to the surface, seconds or minutes after an airliner has passed, and they are very audible, as they twist at high speed.  Given that the witness was close to Lindberg Field makesus wonder about this this possibility.  The phenomenon is very common, close to airports where heavy aircraft are landing.

My wife and I were leaving a friend\u2019s house in Ocean Beach, and I went to start loading the car with all the goodies that our 15 month needs. As always, I was looking up at the sky as I walked to the car and noticed two bright orange lights. I thought nothing of this since there are many aircraft in the area (commercial and military) and I thought the odd colour was just due to atmospheric conditions or something else.  As I kept scanning the sky I noticed that all \u201cnormal\u201d aircraft\u2019s lights were their \u201cnormal\u201d colours, with the usual flashing red markers, etc. So I looked back at the orange lights and noticed that they hadn\u2019t seemed to have moved much, nor changed in size or intensity. This was intriguing, so I kept on watching. I noticed that the lights were moving very slowly but regularly towards the south. Then they suddenly shifted direction and started moving slowly west and then north \u2013 without changing colour/intensity/etc.  There were a few other people in the front-yard of my friend\u2019s house and I asked them to look \u2013 but they kind of just shrugged their shoulders since I was doing a pretty good Richard Dreyfuss as the realization of seeing a real UFO was dawning on me.  I ran to my car to get my video camera and by the time I got that, powered it up and pointed it at the sky \u2013 all of 2 minutes \u2013 the lights were dim but seemed to be in the same position as when I last looked. One was dimmer than the other \u2013 even though they had both been roughly the same intensity before. I shot some footage but haven\u2019t even bothered looking at it yet, as I expect the CMOS sensor and auto-focus probably screwed the whole \u201ccapture\u201d. The world doesn\u2019t need yet another crappy piece of UFO footage, I\u2019m guessing.  Anyway, I continued to watch the lights dim-out which they did over about another 2 minutes.  Later, when trying to make sense of what I\u2019d seen, I thought it must have been some rocket or satellite boosters or something of that nature, but there were no contrails or any smoke or haze around these lights. And if they were military jets, or something of that nature, then they must have been climbing for a hell of a long time \u2013 but without making any sound at all. And their motion from earlier wouldn\u2019t fit normal aircraft flying characteristics.  So, this was a UFO \u2013 I\u2019d love to think it was ET and that 2008 was going to be the year \u2013 but I\u2019ll be happy with a much less glamorous resolution to this.  BTW - I noticed that the following report, is very similar to my own: http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/060/S60019.html  I am a video systems software engineer, an amateur astronomer and a hang glider pilot. I like looking at the skies! And I\u2019ve seen lots of video footage of rocket/shuttle launches/etc.",

Anyway, stars shine, and shift light when visible.  This was a stationary light, real bright.  After, about ten minutes or so the light exploded, or imploded.  It left a visible cloud of smoke and after this happened, you can see a small bright little orb falling slowly away from the cloud of smoke.  After a few seconds, that small light became stationary, then it disappeared.  A few minutes later, you can see two airplanes one behind the other fly by where this light was.

      "story": "Unexplained beings hiking in the middle of the night I went backpacking in Anza Borrego Desert State park with my girlfriend late Saturday afternoon.  We arrived at Borrego around 5 pm, and decided to backpack at Culp Valley Campground.  Culp Valley is approximately 3500 feet in elevation overlooking the Borrego Desert.  We backpacked about 1/2 mile from the trailhead and set up our tent about 20 feet north of the trail.  Nightfall began and I couldn't sleep.  At around 3 am I heard a male voice conversing with someone or something.  I was startled by this realization and sitting in the tent I looked into the direction (about 50 yards from my tent) of the chatter and witnessed a green light moving back and forth.  I noticed the green light was coming closer and closer to the trail near where my tent was located.  I immediately ducked down in my tent and peered out in the front portion of my tent.  I noticed a mass gathering of people (12-15) or beings following the leader holding the green light.  I was terrified asking myself why people were hiking the trail at 3am in the desert.  I quickly took a glance of the party of beings walking past my tent.  I witnessed really tall beings and really short beings wearing white robes holding metal rods with light emitting from the rods.  These beings had bald heads wearing white robes walking very very quietly and slow....with their heads looking left to right with each footstep.  The little beings had robes on and I noticed their long arms swaying back and forth in unison with their feet.  The thing that surprised me was the minimal noise I heard during their walk past my tent.  I've backpacked far too often to hear footsteps of people walking near or around my tent.  It didn't happen in this instance.  The beings reluctantly continued on the trail and the bright lights slowly faded away.  I was panicking during the whole episode and waited 10 minutes to wake my girlfriend up to inform her of my observations.  The next morning I ran down to the trail to gather any form of evidence.  Unfortunately I didn't find anything that was peculiar.  The next day I made a call to the park ranger giving him my account of what happened.  He came up with two theories.  Night scientists or a religious cult.  I personally think it was a ranger guiding extraterrestrials into our natural habitat.",

      "story": "Bluish white and incredibly fast object witnessed over San Diego between cloud cover. On January 27th, 2008 at approximately 6pm, I was exiting my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother\u2019s house in San Diego.  My fianc\u00e9e was already seated in my car.  As I rounded the car to the driver\u2019s side, I opened the door and proceeded to get inside.  Before I had entered the car, I glanced upwards (in the fluid motion of getting into the car, my head looked upwards) and saw the object.  There was low cloud cover, and the clouds were slightly lit from either the moon or the sunset, although not brightly.  Between the sporadic cloud cover, I witnessed an extremely fast bluish-white light traveling from my left to right.  The object appeared to be relatively low to the ground, but above the cloud cover.  There was absolutely no noise.  The first time I saw the object, it lasted for about 2 seconds.  Since I could see the trajectory of the object during that time, my eye continued along the sky to where it would have been if it were not obscured by the cloud covering.  A few seconds later, I witnessed it again between the clouds in the same color and speed as previously seen.  Since I am familiar with fighter jets in this area of San Diego, I am familiar with the relative speed at which they appear to be traveling to the ground observer.  This was significantly faster, and without the usual accompanying sound that jets make.  Additionally, it appeared that the object was completely glowing, or possibly I could only see the flame produced by the object.  It may be important to note that I have better than 20/10 vision, somewhere approaching 20/5 vision.  In the short time I saw the object, I could not see anything traveling in front of the object, such as a rocket, although this could be possible.  Also, the \u201cflame\u201d appeared the have a gradient of color from white at the top to blue at the bottom, not from end to end as might be expected from a jet or rocket flame.  Also, in comparison to the diameter of the flame, this would be an unusually long flame, as it appeared to have a length approximately 10 times i! ts heigh t.  Also, although observed very briefly, the ends of the object appeared to not be pointed, but rather slanted toward the top of the object.  There didn\u2019t appear to be any trail left by the object, although it was so bright that visually it left a slight optical trail.  This was far brighter than what you would expect even a full moon would reflect off a reflective object.  The moon, however, at that time, was below the horizon and not visible.  Sunset had been approximately 45 minutes earlier.  I will e-mail a diagram showing my best estimate at the distances and my position at the time of the sighting.  The red arrow on the diagram shows my position and direction of viewing.  It may also be helpful to know that I have never reported a UFO, nor do I claim to ever have seen anything unexplainable before.  Honestly, this seemed to possibly be something manmade, perhaps the Aurora which I have heard about.",

Airplanes? They can't be because these things are lit up all around consistently from every angle as they move across the sky.  Helicopters? Neither because helicopters cannot fly at that altitude.  The only thing that it might be are satellites but, satellites dont just stop in mid air, or they dont zig-zag during travel.  Another thing, they seem to be moving very fast at times and other times, very slow.  They look exactly how the stars in the background look, same color and size, so sometimes it is hard to spot them, and I'm pretty sure they pass by unnoticed.  It is weird because when you tell someone that hasn't seen them, and you're out there trying to spot one, when you do, and are about to tell them to look up, they just disappear, as if they know your showing them to someone else.  It's happened to me a couple times.  They believe me until that person spots them for themselves, at a different time. Last, sometimes after these things disappear, you can spot an airplane or jet that is out of place from normal air traffic.",

There were no audible engine sound other then a humming noise - the type you would hear emanating from a Goodyear blimp.

We are used to seeing all different types of aircraft flying by and around our home: small private planes, jumbo jetliners, military aircraft, helicopters, etc. Never have we seen anything like we saw on this night. As my wife and I were planning our Thanksgiving dinner, I glanced out a window facing west. I noticed a craft flying in from over the ocean and at first thought nothing of it. After taking a second look, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the uniqueness of this craft. It displayed lights of a shade of red that I have never seen before on any craft. Also, the initial shape of this craft appeared to be rectangular, and it flew perpendicular to the ground. The more I watched this object, the more curious I became. I picked up a pair of binoculars to get a closer look. I thought perhaps I could discern a clearer shape. However, viewing it through the glasses did not prove any better than viewing it with the naked eye. All I could make out was that it seemed to be a flying bay of lights. Fully engaged, I walked outside to continue following the path of this object and attempt to detect any sort of noise. At this point, the craft quietly morphed into a spherical shape. When it appeared to stop its forward progression, I called to my wife to have a look. Begrudgingly, she came outside, but within minutes, she too was enthralled with this craft. It quietly hovered for several minutes then began to move slowly toward the west and gain in altitude. After some small flashes, it continued to fade into the night sky and was gone.",

The one closest to the ground appeared to be just a burning bolt of gold undulating/ cycling gold ripples downward. The second one closest to the bolt appeared as a wing doing spiral 8 patterns & the highest was a whitish corona with the classic saucer shape inbedded and what I found unbelieveable was that this certain one looked exactly like the crafts, (crap)? I thought as such anyways - Ed Walthers was getting from his Gulf Breeze shots. Totally strange to even a glimpse of something resembling this because I never took his pics. seriously. I'm in awe. My little sister buzzed me 20 mins. later freaking, Bro Beam - You were so right because I can see 3 of them right now & I just left the OB area going east out the I-8. $200.00 more & I get the gem i've been saving for & HOPING that an event like this wouldn't transpire UNTIL I got it.

As I was having this thought my friend who I was talking to on the phone said, \"wow, I just saw a shooting star or something\" and I of course shreaked and said I saw it too and then we both realized it could not have been a star; it was too low and too fast and too big and it could not have been a helicopter since we saw it almost instantaneously and I don't think helicopters fly in that area due to the airport.

I found this interesting and decided to transmit signals using my 2 meter ham radio (ten watts) and a cubical quad beam antenna to see what would happen.   I was transmitting for several nights on 146.520 FM (national calling frequency). I would transmit a series of mike cliks while aiming the antenna about 50 degrees off the horizon pointed at the south southeast direction.  This antenna was mounted on the roof of my van and i was doing this nightly from about 2am to about 4am.  I was also transmitting the audio from a digital timex 1000 program (sounds like a bunch of bees).  Then one afternoon around 3pm I was dialing in Michael savage out of san francisco on my radio shack shortwave radio. Suddenly the series of cliks i was transmitting around 3am in the morning were heard in the shortwave receiver.  The receiver was sitting next to the transmission cable leading to the cubical quad beam antenna on the van's roof.  I figure it inducted the signal into the small portable radio receiver. I was not able to figure from which night the signals were returned as I had been doing this for several nights. If it was from the night before it would have been about a 12 hour round trip if from 2 nights before it would have been a 36 hour round trip and so on. Then 9-11 happened and since I was sitting across the bay from Naval Air Station North Island coronado I decided to take the antenna off the roof so as not to be consider spying or anything as that.  So this is one more mystery in my life that I have not figured out.  I invite anyone to try this as right now the window is open up to about sept 11.",

My job in the Marines was TMO 3112. After the attacks on our nation I was detached from my unit and attached to PMO security forces.  I worked the graveyard shift from 1700-0600.  I was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar, San Diego, CA.   The evening of my sighting I was placed on duty, alone, to guard a gate on the flight-line.  I can\u2019t remember the exact gate number, I believe it was 15, but I do know that it was at the north end where the c-130s were parked.  I had been on Security forces for awhile and I had a routine way of keeping myself alert and awake.  It is a severely punishable offence to fall asleep on post. I would take caffeine pills throughout the night and practice drill movements if I felt myself getting tired. On this particular evening I was very alert.  It was particularly cold that night, and being alone on post made me very aware of my surroundings.  The small shack that was my post was not heated, so I would frequently leave the shack and walk the small perimeter of the flight-line that was my post.   On the last of these walks I left my shack and began walking the flight-line.  Something above caught my eye.  As I reverted my gaze upward, I was astonished to see small, bright, circular, orb hovering about 200 yards above the flight-deck.  The object was no bigger than the circumference of my body. I am a female and I stand at about 65 inches.  In a flash, it shot down and hovered inches above the flight deck. It hovered there for a few moments, and then just as quickly as it came down, it shot back up into the night sky, and was gone. I was unsure of how to go about reporting it.  I logged the sighting in my log book and radioed it in to my command post.  I was almost immediately relieved of my duty at that post, by a Staff NCO.  I was told that I was tired and needed to go home and get some rest, and to report back for duty the following evening.  Now that I have fully performed my contract with the Marine Corps I feel that it is time to tell people other than close friends and family. I did not see little green men, or a flying saucer.  I saw what I believe was an unmanned recording device.  I have no reason to lie about what I saw and know that what I saw was real, and I hope that with this report maybe another Marine who was guarding another post on the flight-line that night will come forward.

But it looked to be glowing or burning?  The first thing I said to my girlfriend was,  \"Hey, look at the moon, it looks like it's on fire!\"  She turned around, and we both looked in amazment as the burning sphere in the sky shifted its light source within itself.  At first the entire object was a red/maroon color. over the next two minutes the object seemed to transform the light within, shifting it downward and then upward within the sphere. After a few minutes the object dropped in the sky and we could see it through some trees approx. 3 miles from us.  After that it seemed to fade away and disapear. So, am I crazy or did anyone else see what my girlfriend and I know we saw?   Very interested in knowing!!",

There were four of us, Abe, Javier, Spencer, Pat and Jason (myself).  It must have been back in 1996 when this occurred.  I remember because I had a summer job working at a ranch with my step father. We were driving back from Alice, TX which is a town ten miles from San Diego, TX.  We would go there to look for girls and like the rest of times we came up short that night.  Well, we were about 3 miles from San Diego when a big white bird flew across the rode.  It flew from right to left, then up.  This is what caused us to look in that direction.  Abe was driving his small Ford Escort, (he was the first to see it) I was seating in the passenger seat.  Pat was right behind me.  Then next to him was Javier then Spencer.  Unfortunately Pat wasn\u2019t able to see this thing from where he was sitting and now we always giving him crap about not seeing it.  So, Abe shouts, \"What the hell is that!\"  I look to see and there it was. High up in the air was this Green Rectangle.  Looking at a full moon it would be twice the size.  The shape and color was awe looking.  I hear people say it\u2019s like being in a movie but it\u2019s not like that at all.  It\u2019s real; it\u2019s out of this world.  I\u2019m feeling funny just writing and thinking of the magnitude of what we were all a witness to.  It\u2019s scary.  The color of it was green for sure, but the clarity of it was what gets to me.  It was like a green you\u2019ve never seen before. The green was almost smoke like but solid at the same time. The smoke may have been the light reflecting off the clouds. The interior of it was black or we couldn\u2019t see it. The size of it!!! I believe with all of my heart, that as far as it was and how big\u2026 it must have been 3 football fields wide.  That\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m mostly sure of out of this whole thing.  It was moving up slowly, straight up, and then it was gone.  The interior of the car which was silent is now loud with gibberish and yelling with, \"What was it!\" and \"What do we do?\" it was chaotic for bit but we gathered ourselves and went our separate ways that night.  We all went to our homes.  We always talk about that night.  Thank you for reading. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

July 2009 My UFO Experience:  I was walking up the sidewalk/steps to our south facing home on Law St. in Pacific Beach (San Diego, Ca 92109) in 1970 or 1971, I think about 11 to 12pm when I glanced up at a cold clear night sky & saw a large craft the size of a blimp perhaps with many lights (in fact all I saw were the lights, no outline of the object) approaching to my right & slightly to the north moving silently from east to west.  It was being trailed by two fighter jets (I assume from Miramar Naval Airstation or North Island) that were shooting tracers towards it.  This obviously grabbed my attention.  I had never seen tracers other than in WWII documentaries. As the craft came to be directly in front of me (well above the roofline of the house to the north), it turned north on a dime and accelerated & vanished in an instant.  I realized that it was a UFO when I saw it streak towards LA like a bullet & disappear.  The two jets, which I could now hear, continued to follow by slowly arcing to the north.  The pilots had to be as totally mystified as I was. No man made craft then or now could have made that maneuver.  I thought about reporting this to some authority like the police or the newspaper, but it was late & I just went to bed.  I told my family & friends the next day & I combed the San Diego Union to see if anyone else had reported this but found nothing. This is by far the most incredible & unexplainable thing I have ever witnessed, and to this day I can still visualize it like it happened last night.  I have never witnessed a remotely similar event & to my knowledge, no one has ever reported seeing a UFO over San Diego. I have always wanted to notify an appropriate organization to see if an investigation could locate a Navy report which had to have been filed by the pilots, perhaps two per jet. From that point forward in my life I have always had a tremendous interest in UFO sightings, documentaries, stories, etc. I have had a lifelong interest in the manned space program (I  still have an old scrapbook of news & magazine articles about the Mercury, Gemini & Apollo programs) as well as astronomy & the knowledge constantly evolving about the Universe. I loved the movie Contact so much that I read Carl Sagan\u2019s novel which was just as awesome. I have watched some UFO programs on the Discovery Channel & I believe there were several very well documented UFO sightings/encounters near Catalina Island or the Channel Islands around this time.  I have been wondering if there is a connection between those events & the one I witnessed.  I would love to discuss my experience with a relevant organization in the hopes that it sheds new light or somehow furthers our understanding of this type of phenomenon. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful to the source of the report for his having submitted.  However, talking about a sighting that is at least 38 years old does no good.  We are saddened that he did not contact the newspapers there locally, in order to report the event.  Date indicated for the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I saw a bright light to the east and my boyfriend saw the same object. We both grabbed each others arms and looked in that direction. I saw a round, disk like object with blue lights around 10-15 ft in diameter floating to the left of us. We saw it for approx. 10 seconds and it zipped away in the most odd, quick, zig zag motion i've ever seen and then it shot up going faster than anything i'd ever seen before and it disappeared into the sky. Less than 3 minutes later, there were 3 Army helicopters ( we are in San Diego- Army and Navy base central) were flying over us- so loud that everyone around us could not hear the movie. I'm sure i'm not the only one who saw it- there must have been 100 people at the drive in movie. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

While looking up at the sky,I thought I was looking at a white plastic garbage bag initially blowing in the atmosphere by the way it was moving and responding to the wind. As I watched it for a few minutes I came to realize it couldn't be a plastic bag because it was moving  slowly and with intention to the East and bags just didn't move this way. It was shaped similar to a boomarang, white/silvery in color. When it first came into view it seemed to be about 2-300ft high and almost cruising. I starred at it for about 2-3 minutes before I ran into the house to get my mother, we came back out and was able to locate it immediately. By this time it had moved slightly farthur to the east and upward. It had to be about what I consider 6-700 feet high at this time. The white/silvery color stood out against the clear blue background of the sky. And was no longer heading east, but straight up. It got to a really high altitude and kind of came to a stand still for a period of about 4 minutes then increased in speed really fast and shot out of eye sight for a while. My mother and I screamed and jumped up and down, we couldn't believe what we just saw. Eventually after about 5 minutes she went back into the house, I stayed outside hoping to see it again. About 5 more miutes went by and I kept scanning the area, I saw it and another reappear much farthur to the east, but not as high. They continued to travel southeast in a pair until they went out of my view. It took about 1 minute. About 2-3 minutes after they disappeared I noticed 2 fighter jets hauling butt in the direction in which they were traveling. I assume they were trying to track them.",

The colors were  crisp and bright, had a gem like sparkle, the red looking like a ruby. They flashed in different areas looking as though they were moving around a shape.  But at this point it sat so still, we continued to believe it was a heavenly body of some sort. But the lights looked so conspicuously different than anything else, we continued to observe it carefully.  At first it moved about the speed of a bright planet setting on the horizon.  Then it seemed to set  fast but had moved slightly south.  We lost sight of it and it looked like it was gone so we ignored it for about 10 minutes. Suddenly, it was there again sitting in the sky higher up than when we last saw it and much further to the south, more in front of us. It started to move north at an upward angle for a short distance.  Then floated in a straight line down towards Earth.  Then upwards again ending with a slight but definitely perceptible fast, zig zag pattern.  It's hard to describe it's ability to change it's movements \u2013 it drifted, floated, cruised and had the fast zig zag motion. Losing altitude it moved south at an angle, the lights stopped flashing, it took on a pod appearance and drifted south in a straight line and we lost sight of it. Shortly after wards, the sky appeared active with military aircraft. Did anyone else see this? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

Some were bigger and brighter than others. I put my hazards on and slowed to about 25 mph completely blown away by what I was seeing and trying to come up with a logical explanation. I thought for a minute maybe something had exploded in the sky and i was seeing the embers, then  (There was an airplane heading south that was much lower but had to have seen the same thing I was seeing-probably either just departed or preparing to land at Montgomery Field.)  I pulled off Regents Rd and stopped the car-almost shaking as I watched each light slowly fade away.  I am a native San Diegan and have seen a few odd things in the sky but this is by absolute far the craziest thing I have ever seen in my entire life.  I called Highway Patrol about ten mins after the sighting to see if anyone had reported seeing anything crazy in the sky tonight and they had not received any other calls yet.

At first I thought it was a planet I never recognized before, but I knew that to be false after about fifteen minutes.  At first it was just a bright light, but after staring at the center it looked almost like a cross or even a human shape.  Four spokes (for lack of a better word) sticking out from a main frame.  There were rays of light coming from all sides.  These rays seemed to be rainbow colored and white at different times. It was hard to tell if it was moving or if it was just my eyes, but it seemed like it was moving slightly.

I observed at this location from 7am to 8:30 two aircraft making chemtrails traveling east to west, one was at a higher elevation, and you could see that it was an airplane but it was too high up to get details of the craft. The other plane was at a lower enough elevation to see the size and color of the plane, it had wing tips they were facing up, two jets motors on each wing, drab grey and black in color. You could not hear a jet exhaust noise from the airplanes. I observed 5 passes with this pattern; it would vary in respect to starting from southeast towards northwest and starting northeast towards southwest at the high and low elevations. I could not observe the whole incident, but I saw enough to know these facts to be accurate.  As a few minutes past I  found a vantage point to look at the sky again; I observed 11 chemtrails in the sky at varying heights going east to west and two from a more north to south west direction. I observed during two passes at the lower elevation after the \"cloud\" spread was starting, these planes had no chemtrails coming out of them. Slowly the chemtrails would spread out and the slight westerly breeze would push them east, you could see these \"cloud\" were stopping from the atmospheric pressure of the local mountains, so the chemtrails spread out from north to south. It appeared like there were several very, very long thin \"clouds\" stretching from east to west. By mid afternoon I could no longer feel the warm sun which I had from the morning or see bright blue sky. The sky was filled with a hazy looking \"cloud\" layer. Not any cloud I have seen, but a hazy white cover in the sky, with slight blue sky color penetrating through. As of this writing at 5:45pm PST there is still a white even haze in the sky, at my homes vantage point I can see normal puffy clouds behind the local Mt. Laguna to the east, which I see all the time as a normal weather pattern occurrence. These \"hazy clouds\" on the west side of Mount Laguna, were created from the trails of these military looking jet aircraft as I have described here. There is no round or puffiness shape to it, as with normal natural clouds, in regards to the hazy flat white layer created by these planes.",

I was standing outside on the porch enjoying the fresh air. I was looking to the north when I saw a large ball of fire.  It really startled me because it didn't look like it could be more then 1,000 feet high in the sky. Looking directly at it the size might have been the size of 2 basketballs put together.  I used my neighbors roof peak to give the fall a direction.  If the peak of their roof was 12 o'clock the fireball fell to 3:30 in 10-15 seconds.  I ran from the porch to the sidewalk.  Just when I thought it was going to crash into the houses about 1/2 block north of where I was standing it went poof and was gone.  By poof I mean that it got dim and just disappeared.  It didn\u2019t shatter or fall apart, it just got dim and was gone. The fireball itself was a bright white and the flames around the outside were neon lime green closest to the circumference then neon yellow and finally a very bright orange.  (The orange wasn't as intense as the other colors.)   I have never seen anything burn with those colors, as you are familiar with flame at the orifice of a gas burner it is the hottest at the very brightest blue, the gets cooler as you move away. I checked the San Diego newspaper the Union Tribune for 2 days and there was nothing mentioned about what I saw.",

My fiance and myself stood on the sand at Ocean Beach last night (February 12, 2009) for over and hour watching a large glowing orb (UFO) in the sky over the ocean. I watch the planes come and go out of San Diego almost every night and this extremely bright orb got my attention immediately. This isn't the first time I've seen something like this, but this was the closest one. It was extremely bright. So bright that I couldn't make out any detail and it looked kind of fuzzy with bright short streaks surrounding it.  I first noticed it around 8pm or so, and watched it for over an hour come a bit closer, go out, move a bit up and down, horizontally, and in seemingly random directions. It would slowly go very dim, then extremely bright. This was in our atmosphere and not out in space. When a cloud would cover the UFO, the cloud appeared to be glowing from within, then the light would turn into a very dim pinpoint. When the fast moving cloud would move, it seemed the orb \"knew\" and would quickly turn bright again, just after the cloud had gone.  I heard a military helicopter (and living in SD, I know what one sounds like) going toward the orb, then what sounded like a military fighter jet. The helicopter seemed to have turned its lights off when it got close the the orb, but I could still hear that it was there circling around. The jet seemed to have no lights on the entire time. I watched for as long as I could, but I was cold and went to my car.  I would look at it once in a while to see if it was still there at it would have moved its position a little. Eventually it had disappeared. I did not see how it \"took off\" or if the light just went out. This orb was near the flight path of outgoing planes. I know they must have seen it.

It was flickering red and orange and I noticed a moving aircraft near it, possibly a helicopter or small jet.  What really caught my attention was the fact that the object I was looking at did not move at all.  If it was a aircraft, it would have moved either to the right or left or something but this light was just in the sky with no movement.  I watched it for about 1 minute outside and then it just faded away!!  The object was north of the base and looked close to the coast if I had to estimate its location.  It was close enough that I could see the two distinct colors of red and orange but far enough away that I could not see any type of shape to the object except that it reminded me of a planet or something like that.

The object was like a flying wing approximately the size of a hangglider.  It actually resembled a kite with rounded edges white lights or paint along the nose of the objects.  No sound at all,  the object was very faint and appeared to be somewhat transparent like a floating light green shower curtain.

It includes a lot of details that you might find interesting or useful, so I will include everything instead of typing a new report. I just heard that there was a report on San Diego Local News within the last few 3 days of people reporting the same sighting. Monday Febuary 23rd 2009  I swear to you on my life Yas'...this is all true....This is how it happened....It was about 1:10 am...I went out onto the back deck to call in my cat. She didn't appear. I sat down in my usual spot and lit a cigarette to wait for her. As I looked back up I saw three little red lights way off in the distance. Jets I thought. We live right in the middle of the flight path for San Diego Airport, so I watch the incoming jets lined up in the distance 20 or 30 miles away when it's clear. Which it was this night. No clouds. But I quickly noticed that there was something different about these lights. They weren't staggered like planes lining up for their landing approach which I I've seen thousands of times in my life and watched out here for the last month and 1/2 everynight. Next I'm like, but the Airport is closed. It's been closed for at least an hour. No incoming or outgoing flights until 6:00 am. So I'm thinking smaller private planes..? Military Jets.? Why are the lights not flashing like ALL jets and planes do..with red lights on the right wing and green on the left. These are just red. Constant ..No flash at all. And they are coming closer, but they are still all together like in a pattern. They were getting brighter and bigger, but they were moving much slower than any planes..Taking way longer to get to where they should be in the landing path. Helicopters..?  They are getting closer and it's starting to hit me that I may be seeing something very strange. By now I'm standing up going saying out loud to myself...What the hell are those ? And they just kept coming still way off maybe 10 miles or more..But defenitely coming straight towards me. It was getting weirder by the second as they kept approaching.Then I slipped in the door and grabbed the binoculars. Is it a blimp..? Some kind of balloon. It was defenitely not an aircraft, helicopter or anything like that. It was coming right up over the top of the mountain ridge on the other side of the valley. And it was then I really started to kinda freak out..not really, but more like excited...what was it.... I came back out on the deck and I put the binoculars up to my eyes and focused. What I saw made my jaw drop. It was Huge..I mean the size of a Football field.One more second and that was it..Everything suddenly clicked in my brain... I had logically ruled out every possible explanation. It was a UFO. My mind had no doubt at that point. I was seeing a \"real\" UFO. I was wittnessing what they call a \"sighting\". I knew I had never seen anything like this in my life and then I realised it was one soild object. A triangle. It was perfectly visible now and moving slow...floating no sound..It just hit me..NO Sound at all.  Oh my God. I was in shock. Through the binoculars it was very clear and I could now see the defenite shape of a triangle and just then it started to turn slightly and I could see the red lights..one on the nose and two on the rear tips. A giant silent floating triangle. I couldn't beleive what I was seeing...but yet I really did..I knew. I kept staring in amazement..And the it rotated even more and swung around completly where I could see it from the side. It was incredible.! Then it just stopped..and hung there and I focused the binoculars on it again and I could cleary see the outline of the triangle. barely visible..but it was defenitely there..It was slightly brighter than the sky behind it, but it blended in so well you had to really look closely to see it. Oh my God ! Picture..I gotta get a picture...!  By now I had been watching it for at least 7 minutes or more...It just hung there..almost motionless...completly silent...Like I said it was giant...three times the size of even our largest Jumbo Jets...Bigger than the Damm Space Shuttle..My mind was racing now...I was afraid to walk away and grab the camera in case it did someting or took off...But I made my move...Boom I dashed in the house..snatched my Mom's camera and ran back out..10 seconds....Still there...! I turned on the camera and started to take the shot, but the display menu was on the screen and in the viewfinder and it wouldn't shoot...Damm it..! I kept messing with it with one eye on the lights...I could not get it to work..I tried for two more minute I'd say and then I gave up....And went back to staring through the binoculars...It was absoultely stunning. My brain is racing a million miles an hour.... With thoughts like........Is anyone else seeing this...? Can I be the only one in this entire valley that is seeing this...? Should I call someone..?...who...? 911...? the news station..?...Someone has to see this....God why is the camera stuck.. I am standing here looking at a UFO just hanging in the sky and I can't get a picture..Who is gonna beleive this..?   Mom...!  I have to wake her up...I start to go inside to wake her up...What if it's gone by the time she gets out here...? She is gonna think I have lost my mind or I am drunk or on drugs or something...Anything except seeing a UFO....! Oh well..I have to take a chance it will still be here...it's been here this long and with no sign of moving..I hesitated only a few seconds more and made my move...she can make the camera work...! It's her camera.!...Boom..I ran.....Ten seconds I am upstairs at her door pounding Mom Get Up..! Mom..! Wake up.....!  She answers starteled from her sleep...Jeffrey what is it....?  Whats wrong..?     I hear her getting up... Outside....Look out the window..!  She says while frantically getting dressed, Whatis it...?   I don't know I said....Lights..Red Lights...We gotta get a picture....!   She gets to her window and looks out I guess and says ...\"Jeffrey those lights are on the Road  across the hill\"...I had already started back downstairs and was yelling..\"Get down here..Hurry..You gotta see this and the damm camera won't work...!  I hear \"my step father\"grumbling in the background....\"What the Hell is going on ?\".... I hollared back at him..Get up _____, get out here quick...get your camera..your not gonna beleive this thing...! I was gone  In less than a minute I was back out and I looked up praying it was still there. It was. Same spot. Just \"hovering\" there..effortlessly. I go back to the binoculars...It is mesmerizing. A few seconds later and Mom is beside me...Still not sure what I'm seeing....She looks out and says again..\"my name\"...\"Those lights are on the hill over there\"  Kinda pointing across the valley off to her right .....I say No Mom...Up there..In the Sky......and point as I handed her the binoculars.  She puts them up to her eyes and fixes on the lights.....I waited for what I knew was coming.....Oh My God.!...Jeffrey..What is that ?  It's a UFO Mom...\"There is no doubt in my mind\". Look at that thing...the size of it. She already knew I was right. It was undeniable. It can be nothing other than a UFO. She just keeps staring going...\"Oh My God...It's unbeleivable...\"  I start pointing out all the details...No sound...the outline..telling her to look really close and keep the binoculars very still. She could see it all perfectly..She was astonished. I could still see it fine with just fine without the binoculars.  \"We gotta get a picture Mom...Fix the camera... I practically hand to pry the binoculars out of her hand and handed her the camera.. She turned it back on and waited for it to set, but it did the same thing..and she kept messing with it but it wouldn't take a shot. It just kept getting stuck.And I knew it wasn't going to. I was frantic to get a photo and yelled for \"My step father\" again a few seconds later he was there. Still half asleep ..going \"What the Hell you guys...\".....We just pointed...and I handed him the binoculars. All the while, Mom is still fumbling with her camera, looking up and down still shocked. Then it's ---\"his\"--- turn..After he looks at it for a few seconds....Same thing...\"Oh My God\"...That is a UFO ____...!..Look how big it is..!  We said something like Yes...Yes..Get your camera ----------This one is stuck... Another minute of mumbling words and staring at it in awe and he hands Mom the binoculars and takes off for his camera. I was pissed that I don't have one right now, except for on my phone, and that would not have shown up so far away. Even with their cameras it might not show up very well but I think it should be visible and it could be some kind of proof. Mom and I just keep staring and I tell how it appeared and everything. We were both still toatally stunned. What a sight. We were so excited and were convinced it was very real. Our eyes couldn't lie to us. By now it had been over 15 minutes since I first saw it. ______ comes back with his camera, and gets ready to shoot....But of course...It goes dead....He turns it back on...Boom...It shuts down again...Dead battery...We are all frustrated...Damm It.I don't know what is more unbeleivable..A UFO hanging in the sky in front of us or that we have two cameras that won't work....I can't beleive we can't get a picture... Another couple minutes and we realized that neither camera was going to work and we were disappointed, but still excited. We talked about calling 911...the police...fire department...But we just kept staring. I am serious Baby...It was truly Fantastic..I wish you could have been here to see it yourself. Then as we continued taking turns with the binoculars, It started to move again. We all said something...It began to turn it's nose back toward the direction it had came from go sideways..the it suddenly pulled up until it became completely vertical...straight up and down like it was standing on it's tail end with it's nose pointing straight up in the sky. It stopped there for a few seconds, and then it flipped around and went back leveled out facing the direction it had appeared from and hovered there again. To see it turn like that we all knew that anything we have that flys in the sky can not make those manuevers...especially without making a sound....We watched...eyes wide open..fascinated.... But what happened next was the most incredible part of the whole thing and left us almost speechless..It slowly began to disappear...one light at a time....what looked like the \"front light\" slowly dimmed out...It wasn't moving away though like the way it approached. It was actually vanishing....the 1st light...then the 2nd and then the 3rd...it took about 30 seconds to disappear. And it was gone just like that. It wasn't like it moved far away or went up or anything..it completly vanished right in mid air. We talked about the whole thing for about 45 minutes...All kinds of ideasand questions...what it was...what it wasn't...why was it here...did anyone else see it or report it..get a picture or video.....Is it possible for us to be the only people to see it....On and on..... We turned on the news and went through the local channels..Nothing.... We said we should report it..but to who..?...the police..and what would they do...Laugh..Probably take the report and throw it away..thats it. So I said I would go on the internet and find a UFO \"Hotline\" or something and make a report and see if anyone else made any reports also. About an half an hour after it had gone I looked out my window and saw several small planes flying around the area which was wierd that late at night..They flew around the area for a while and they flew off. I went back to the internet and a few hours later the next thing I knew it was 6:00 and the sun was coming up. Then I heard jets... Military jets...they were blazing around all over up there going around in a sort of big circle. This went on for about half an hour and then fly off away. They defenitely looked like they were looking for something. I'm pretty sure I know what it was..!  As of now I have not found any peports from that night, but I haven't looked yet today..But I will. Someone had to have seen it too.  What an experience Yas'. I'm not kidding Babe it was straight out of a movie scene...but undeniably real. Thank God I woke Mom and _______  up and we all saw it together...Otherwise they would probably beleive I saw something..but that it was something more explainable than a UFO. But we all agree it wasn't. I am 100% positive in my mind that it was some kind of \"Craft\"...Who was inside it is the big question. Extraterrestrials...?or was it the military testing a secret \"spacecraft\" which we supposedly crashed in Roswell New Mexico back in the 1947and we learned how to work and used the technology to build our own \"Ships\". All that goes on about 600 miles or so from San Diego in Nevada at the militarys most secretive base called Area 51. People claim they have all kinds of strange \"spacecraft\" out there. Who really knows. Why would they fly anything down here in San Diego..? I personally don't think it was \"us\" flying that thing. I beleive it was defenitely extraterrestrial in origin. We are wondering if it will appear again.....sometimes \"sightings\" as they call them happen alot in clusters in the same area over a short period of time.....it's possible.and I'm ready with a camera that works..just in case... I doubt it.  But we'll be keeping our eyes on the sky around here thats for sure.......I stayed up last night to see if it would return...It didn't. I could go on and on about all the details but I'll stop for now.and write more later. Pretty wild huh Babe !?! I'll tell you one thing...It was defenitely an experience that none of us will ever forget as long as we live.",

My wife said \"look honey look, what is that?\" When I looked up I saw a disk shaped saucer with a raised area in the middle, maybe for the pilots head/body. It was over a residential area moving right to left towards homes. It had no lights on at the time but it was close enough to see that it did have them. It flew too fast to be a helicopter but too slow to be a jet. were maybe 100 to 150 yards away from it but it made absolutely no sound. It was way too big to be a remote controlled toy, I would guess it was a one man craft. It looked like the classic saucer design from old alien movies. It was dark so it was hard to make out an exact color but I would say it was a dark metal gray. As far as size I'd say it was 15-20 ft. in diameter. If you have any info on this I would love some feedback as Im not a UFO enthusiast and I have no explanation for this. Im %100 sure that what I saw was real. Like I said it was very close, VERY surreal. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  We cannot certify that this report is intended as a serious-minded description of an alleged sighting.  PD))",

At approximately 40 minutes past midnight on Saturday morning 3/21/09 I observed two round disc shaped objects estimated to be 15 to 20 feet in diameter approximately 1500 feet in elevation near Mission Valley just east of my home.  Each disc had eight bright blue circular lights around the perimeter of the craft.  The lights were estimated to be 14-16 inches in diameter. They were hovering and making quick small motions darting slightly left than right and up and down. One of the two craft even slightly wobbled for a couple seconds. One of the craft than appeared to dart away completely east and disappeared.  Excited I woke my wife a she saw the same thing.  We also overheard some neighbors two houses down the street talking in an excited manner about the crafts, so we are not the only ones to have witnessed this.  The remaining craft slowly lowered down than disappeared.  One more thing the blue lights occassionally dimmed about three times and once when out completed for a second before becoming bright again. One more thing there were no sounds.  I am a electrical engineer for the DoD and must insist my name be kept anonymous.I have provided my contact info if you would like to talk to me.",

My wife and 21 year old son witnessed this very strange event while traveling Southbound on 5-S.  I am currently in Tucson,  AZ, as a retired U.S. Navy Chief (reason being that I retired June 1 of last year and due to our economy going down the tubes, I had no choice but to lose everything and begin traveling in search of my post naval career), but back on topic...my wife called me to report seeing 3 rather large (larger than anything Boeing has ever made) triangular shaped craft which was soon joined by a 4th craft.  Then the craft merged into one and began making some very interesting shapes in the sky (as you will see on the photos).  I immediately informed her to pull over as soon as she could and begin snapping pictures. Unfortunately by the time I got that message across (our first 2 attempts at connecting via cell phone were no good as we would lose signal), but by the time I got the message across sunset had already set in however, my wife used a Palm Treo 650 cell phone with its camera settings on maximum resolution to take the pictures (in which I have about 25 total).  The Palm returned some very interesting photos to say the least.  Upon receiving the pics I immediately reported the sighting to MUFON and filed a report:  Case Number:  22723.  At the end of the event they all seemed to merge into 1 or 2, dipped down from their hover and shot skyward at a very high rate of speed (in which one of them pulsed red as he/she ascended)   Later that evening I noticed that 2 or 3 other people in Southern California reported UFO activity.   One report identically mirrored what my wife and son saw (which indicated 4 craft merging into 2).   We are DEFINITELY not alone in this universe. Thank you.  JC",

I turned in the passenger seat to see if I could catch a glimpse of it through the back window of the car. I could see the aircraft silhouetted against the sky for several seconds before the aircraft vanished in an instant. There were other commercial aircraft in the vicinity due to the proximity to the SD international airport, but the chevron was definitely not commercial.

The amazing thing was how large it was and also the shape of it.  It was rectangular, just a little bit wider than high.  It seemed to have some kind of a band running around the center of it but was hard to make out the detail.  I took two quick shots with my cell phone camera.  The first one was off as I was driving and just trying to point and shoot.  The second one I got a shot of the object as it was almost touching the northern horizon and appeared pretty small by this time.  The shocking thing was the size and shape of it.  I was initially, I\u2019d estimate, 4 or 5 miles from it and it was easily over 300 feet wide and 200 feet tall.  The color seemed to be a dull battleship grey.",

Looked like a mirror in the sky, not moving.  To the right of mirrored object was a white cloud, seconds later after seeing object another object came out of cloud moving beside 1st object.  They were now both just side by side not moving. After about 10 minutes the objects went straight up out  of sight.  About 50 of us saw it because we were on lunch break sitting outside against the building eating our lunches.   I was at  San Diego naval base going to shipfitter school when this sighting occured. Everyone was just saying what the hell is that and that was the end of it.  For years i always thought about it and after seeing on the news and tv shows about ufo's I figured I would report it. Better late than never. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting in June 1967 is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Confirm a report dated 02/12/09 in San Diego at approx 20:00 hrs. I was outside sitting on the back covered patio of the house where I rent a room. I looked up into the sky to the southwest and saw a strange looking light that I 1st thought was the moon until I could tell wasn't as the moon was located obove the patio roof more to the south. I could see the moons lumination on the ground.  As I watched the light I noticed that it was moving slowly towards the direction that I was in and was getting larger. Its shape was like a shollow plate on the bottom with an inverted upside down bowl on the top.  After about 5 minutes the object slowly changed it course so that it was moving to the North.  I don't know its size but I would have to guess tht it was a few hundred feet long and possibly 75 to 100 feet high.  As it was going to the North noticed that it had a small red light on the top and a small red light in the \"Tail\" end. (south end) The lights were not flashing. I have worked at a large Naval Air Station for close to 30 years. This craft was not anything that I had ever seen before. It made no sound at all. It appeared to be lit up from the inside as a tube light.  It was not overly bright and I could hear some of the people in the neighborhood oustside saying things like \"look at that thing\" etc. Shortly after the craft started in its northerly direction, I went inside and told a couple of the people what I saw and we went out to the front yard to watch it. After watching for a while longer we went inside.  I watched the news that night and nothing was said about it.  The local San Dego paper the next morning had a small article about some some fiery objects in the sky the just previous night.  I did not report it then with my view as I figured it would probably be covered up some how anyway.  I just happened to be looking at this site on the internet for the 1st time and decided to see if the incident was reported here. It was. Let me repeat, only one large fat (in the middle) cigar shaped object was seen from our view.",

I will not even say what craft he flown for fear of narrowing down his chances of being picked out.   The information is that a craft of around a mile in diameter appeared off the coastline of San Diego at night above the cloud layer.  It has multiple antennas dotting across its surface all around it.  It had bulbous mirror like windows spaced out evenly around the entire spacecraft.  Each bulb emitted randomized color effects at a normal pulse of probally 1 per second randomly on any given bulb.   When the pilots were tasked to go out to investigate the anomalous object.  There were already multiple fighter jets on station.  They flew around it for over a hour at the minimum taking pictures and video.  At some point it started pulsating rapidly then completely disappeared.   Winked out that is.   One of those pilots is a high ranking officer and one of those pilots from what I am told was a Nasa director.  This story was told in confidence because a life was saved and felt the need to relieve this information to someone other than themselves.   Collabration between the nasa director and the other pilot upon telling the story were both agreed upon.

I was standing outside with two friends atop a higher hilly region a few miles off of Del Mar Heights Road in the Del Mar area of San Diego (more inland about 5-7 miles East of the 5 Freeway).  We had all just finished admiring the panoramic view and the various skylines when something drew my eyes back to that part of the sky. All of a sudden, I saw what appeared to be a very low shooting star way off in the distance. It is hard to decipher where it was exactly in San Diego, as it seemed to be over 10 - 20 miles south / southeast of where we were. Immediately, I told the others and they watched what initially appeared to be a shooting star begin to rise back up in the sky. I found myself saying, \"Wait a minute, that's not supposed to happen.  That's not a shooting star afterall.\"   The object was glowing red and green and was hard to identify the shape.  Instead of dissipating into the atmosphere after it fell, it began to move close to the ground next to a few tall buildings (5 - 10 stories in height).  It then moved back up in a jig jagged way.  It went about 5 stories above the taller buildings and then swooped back down near the ground again. We all looked away as we joked at what it could be.  \"Hopefully it's just a very nicely made remote control toy or something.\"  But then I realized it had impressively bright lights.  We all looked back a third time to see if it was still there, and found it was very high up in the sky - about as high or even higher than a commercial airplane flies.",

The lights I saw were only a few yards apart about 50 yards approximately, they went only in one direction to the east but came from the north and then I hurried up the hill I was walking on because there were some trees in my way in view of the lights so when I got to the top of the hill I saw the last light drift off into the east but also disapperead and tonight is thanksgiving.The weather was clear no clouds, no rain nothing.   I will admit I have never seen this before.  The lights just disappearing into thin air..  I cant explain anymore.",

Extremely fast light flying just over the lowest rain clouds sometime between 10:05 and 10:10 pm, Thursday October 6 in San Diego, California.  This light was traveling from south to north.  The light was not white.  It was very bright, somewhere between the colors orange and red.  It was larger than any star in the sky; maybe 3 times the size of the largest star you see.  Of course it could be a meteor; but I do not think so.  It did not look like any meteor I have ever seen.  I have seen a lot of meteor showers.  It seemed like it was flying level and just over the lowest cloud layer.  No sound. There is not much to this sighting.  It only lasted a couple of seconds.  If you extend your arms at full length, just over one and a half feet apart----the light traveled that much space in the sky in less than 2 seconds.  If you consider straight up as 90 degrees, then the light was traveling at about 70 degrees south to north.  I was standing near the corner of Washington Street and Front Street here in San Diego.  Front Street runs north and south, so I knew the direction the light traveled. I did not have my watch with me to get the exact time, but the sighting was between 10:05 and 10:10 pm, Thursday October 6. It had rained earlier in the day; so there were patches of clear sky and low patches of rain clouds.   The light was not seen further north because the clouds blocked the view further north. This area has a lot of jet traffic for the San Diego airport.  This light was traveling at least 5 times faster than any jets in this area.   And again, no sound and the light was nothing like a meteor in my opinion.  The light seemed self contained and traveling flat just over the lowest clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two similar sighting reports from the same source.  Other sighting was over Carlsbad, CA,  at 22:20 hrs. on Thursday, October 01, 2011.

Last night, Monday August 27 at 8:25 pm I had a sighting here in San Diego, California.  I was about 2 miles southeast of the intersection of Interstate freeways 5 and 8.  This sighting started out with a solid yellow-orange light coming towards me from the north towards the south.  I was looking north.  There were no collision lights like a normal plane or jet would have.  Many jets and planes are seen down here as this area is along the landing path for the San Diego airport.  Jets that are flying south will head south along the 5 freeway and then turn east over the 8 freeway in preparation of landing at the San Diego airport.  I am very familiar with seeing these jets and planes.  And these aircraft have collision lights, and in this sighting, there were no collision lights on this yellow-orange light.  Anyway, this yellow-orange light was moving slowing towards me.  It was almost as large as the front light seen on an approaching jet, which is larger tha! n a star in the sky.  After viewing this Yellow-orange light for about 30 seconds, it slowing turned off.  Nothing.  I kept watching the area where the light had disappeared and about 2 minutes later, but much higher in the sky, the light, or a light, powered back on and quickly flew west to east.  This time, the light was mostly white, but looked a duller color than the stars.  It was not moving slowly, but faster than a jet would move at that higher elevation.  I lost track of it after about 30 seconds as it was too far away.  Then about 15 to 20 minutes later, maybe about 8:45pm, I saw a white light power-up directly north of me again; but this time lower than the first 2 lights described above.  This last time the light was as low as the jets coming in for their landing descent.  The light was not directly in the jets path, but somewhat more north.  It was slowing moving south to north and slow.  I did not see this last light very long, maybe 15 seconds and then it slow! ly turned off or powered down.  I say powered down, because th! at's the impression I got when I saw it turn off.  Again, no collision lights.  It was just gone.  I don't know if this was 1 craft or 2 or 3 separate crafts.  I did not hear any noise.  I should have heard something, at least for the last light since it was closer, but I did not.",

      "story": "I saw a ginormous, rectangular, metallic UFO in broad day light over the naval base. It was a warm, sunny, and windy day on the bay in San Diego. \u00a0I was about 8 to 12 years old and my neighbor was 2 years my senior. \u00a0His father took us fishing at Shelter Island Pier which faces North Island Naval Complex to the southeast(according to google maps). \u00a0The pier was wooden at the time and has since been rebuilt but is more or less in the same spot perpendicular then parallel to its shoreline in a 'T'. I am unsure of the exact time of day, it was likely between 11am and 2pm. \u00a0I am unsure of the month but the time of year was likely spring or summer because of how high and bright the sun was that day.  This could have been a Saturday afternoon, spring break or summer vacation. \u00a0The year was anywhere from 1989 to 1993. I believe my friend's dad noticed the UFO first, to the north. \u00a0We were on the south end of the pier looking north to our left. \u00a0It was gray/ dull-metallic in color and looked like a flying cruise ship with no protrusions of any kind. \u00a0It was flat and thick as if many levels to it, but was rectangular. \u00a0It appeared to have ports on its side or perhaps markings. \u00a0The craft was so high up that finer details \u00a0of its side were blurry and I had 20/20 vision all through school-age. \u00a0It had no lights visible and made no noise which I remember finding strange, so I remembered the whole incident fairly well. I think the craft was in excess of 200yards long and thousands of feet high in altitude. If i hold my thumb up out in front of me, the craft appeared about 1-1.5inches wide by about 2/8 to 3/8inches thick and atleast 45 degrees above horizon. It moved very slowly for approximately 15 minutes, traveling north to south from our vantage point.\u00a0It seemed to be high above North Island and Coronado. \u00a0 In relation to all the other planes and blimps that were nearby at lower altitudes made the size of this \"craft\" very large and very high.  At the time many of these facts were pointed out by my friends dad, whom seemed to be astonished and in disbelief. \u00a0 I knew both my neighbor and his father to be intelligent people and I have a background in science and medicine. \u00a0We discussed how incredibly awkward the craft was for about an hour with other fisherman after we lost sight of it. \u00a0It was fairly unspectacular because of its super slow speed and dull color. \u00a0It didn't seem to spin or turn or deviate from its southern route. \u00a0Someone speculated it could have held as many people as Star Trek's Enterprise-D if it were real. \u00a0We passed it off as a military craft because it was so visible to everyone, it didn't move erratically, it was in close proximity to the naval base, and it disappeared just as silently as it appeared. \u00a0 To my knowledge no one has reported on this &quot;mother ship&quot; sighting.

The clouds were broken and irregularly spaced. The first sighting was at 7:35pm and it was of a single light.  The second sighting was only 12 minutes later at 7:47pm and it contained 2 lights or crafts.  The second, or later sighting, was much closer and was at the same level as the low clouds.  These 2 lights or crafts had just passed over my house, or I assume they had passed over my house; but anyway, they were already a little north and a little east of my house, almost overhead and traveling NNE.  These 2 crafts were close to each other. If I stuck my hand out in front of me, 3 fingers would represent the distance between the crafts! .  One craft or light was ahead of the other one and it was brighter.  They were traveling faster than the jets do in this area. I saw them for 10 seconds before they went into the clouds.  They were traveling NNE, which would make them cross the normal jet traffic which goes west to east before turning around to come back to the San Diego Airport to land. I did not see any commercial aircraft in the area during this second sighting. The first sighting was a single light almost overhead, but a little east. This light or craft was very high. It could have been mistaken for a satellite, but it was not a satellite. It was traveling too fast to be a satellite. I saw this sighting for about 10 seconds also before it was hidden by cloud cover. I did not hear any noise from any of the crafts. I should have heard noise from the second sighting since they was so close; almost directly overhead when I first saw them.",

This single white or slightly blue-white light was traveling slowly SW to NE; slower than the commercial jet.  I first saw this single light south of me and it flew almost directly overhead, but slightly east of me and then continued in a straight line NE till I could not see it any longer. It was traveling just above the lowest fluffy clouds.  After it passed me, while heading NE, it went just above a small cloud at the same time that a commercial jet which was traveling through the same cloud. The jet was flying west to east preparing to turn around east of the San Diego Airport and then land. They were not very far apart; but I don't know how far! apart.  They basically were in the same cloud. I could easily see the front white light of the commercial jet as well as the wing lights and collision lights before it went into the cloud.  The single light had no collision lights.  At this time of night, the sky was not black, but a blue black. Not only could I see the lights on the commercial jet, but I could still see the outline of the wings, the body of the jet and the tail section.  The single light did not have any wings or anything visible other than the light itself. I am sure I would have been able to see wings if this single light or craft had wings.  The single light was less than a quarter the size as the outline of the jet.  Again, the single light or craft passed just above the cloud and the commercial jet went through the cloud.

I live near the Mexican border in San Diego and I was facing south towards the horizon listening to my iPod when I notice a big green jolt of light shoot out of the horizon. It reminded me of something you see in Star Wars, the light changed from green to blue to purple, spreading across the night sky in a window shield wipe effect. I was so taken back from what I\u2019ve saw, I stopped and looked around in the parking lot I was in and no one was there.  I saw a woman in a parked car and ask if she seen anything strange, but her back was facing from what I seen. She laughed and I laughed too (out of nervousness). I was still stunned from what I seen and trying to understand what I saw that lasted 5 seconds. As I was walking out of the parking lot and I saw two women who I passed by earlier while I was walking to the store. I asked if they so that light in the sky. They said they saw it also, I can tell they were scared and confused. We spoke for about 5 minutes trying to understand what we saw.  I went home still in disbelief. I know this wasn\u2019t just some earthly phenomenon, something in my heart tells me it was something I will never understand. I tweeted what I saw asked if anyone in my city seen it. I got a response from some who lives about maybe 5 miles from where I saw it and she seen it too. I checked for the local news that night and no mentions and nothing from the Mexican news. The next few days I checked online and couldn\u2019t find any reports. I tried to do some research of what I saw, but also couldn\u2019t find anything close to what I saw that night. It\u2019s something I will always remember and these typed letters cant justified what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I along with four other friends in a car were driving along the 5 south exit and Pershing in San Diego California when we saw a bunch of cars pulled to the side of the road.    Seeing the cars pulled to the side we decided to pull off to the side as well and when we got out of the car we noticed about 40-50 people standing around looking at the sky.  Looking up we could see approximately 20 that my friend next to me pointed out of what looked to be orb type objects in the sky.  This was in the area where the planes fly for Lindburgh field the airport as we heard a big airplane fly thru.  They made a formation and looked to be hovering in groups as they were really close to each other, than a couple minutes later they were gone.",

There are very few people in the park at that time because they close the parking lot and you need to park on a side street and walk into the park.  It was a cool damp misty sort of night with clouds and lots of layers of atmosphere.  We saw these dancing lights in the sky and at first tried to explain it--maybe strobe lights or reflections of some kind but nothing made sense.  The lights would start from one source, then spread out and dance around and then return to the source light. The whole sky had a different quality to it, almost like a magnetic type of storm.  This went on for 5-10 minutes, then the lights returned to their source point. I could still see where they were, it was a slight glow in the clouds, but they stayed there and stopped dancing. I had the feeling it knew we were watching.  The source light was still there when we left the park.  We ! have been back to the park several times since, but have not encountered those conditions or seen the lights again.",

As we faced south we could see the object which appeared at first to be a very bright star.  My girlfriend pointed it out to me and asked if it was a star.  It became apparent that it was not. As we watched the object would move to the west in short but rapidly accelerated bursts.  The object would then rapidly change course and head to the north or several times appearing to reverse direction or wobble side to side but in a very rapid fashion.  We observed the object doing these short bursts and also observed it stand completely still.  The object would also intensify and dim in brightness but this did not seem to be related to any type of cloud cover or change in distance.  It also did not change intensity in light on any type of timed interval. After 30 minutes a fireworks display shot off by Sea World had concluded and the object seemed to remain stationary at this point.  It should be noted that when the fireworks started the object also paused for a period of several minutes then resumed its irregular flight maneuvers. I spent 8 years in the United States military during which time I was in a flight unit with fixed wing aircraft and helicopters.  I can say that this craft moved in ways I have never seen military or commercial aircraft move.",

The bird, it had a perfect shape wings spread and all, appeared to light, not glow, just like the stars. It sailed across the sky without flapping its wings and the time it took from the moment I saw it, the upper west region of the sky, to the time it disappeared in the western side of the sky, not fully the lower horizon, could not be traversed by a bird.  And there was no wing flap, it was a perfect image of a large bird of pray moving across they sky wit! hout change. I have seen \u201cstars\u201d moving across the sky on these same types of moments when I step out for a smoke. I have seen what could be satellites, or some other space junk.  I have seen what are obviously are planes with the flashing lights and all. But I have never seen this.  It was a fully formed bird with wings spread, soaring across the sky without a single flap of the wings, at a height far above what a bird would soar, and a steady light, exactly like the stars.

      "story": "Black sphere over San Diego airport flying against the wind north to south Yesterday, onn Saturday September 22 at about 4:45pm (give or take 5 minutes), I had a sighting here in San Diego, California.   I was viewing this sighting from about 2 miles southeast of the intersection of Interstate freeways 5 and 8 in the community called Mission Hills.  Most of the sky was covered in tropical clouds; but there was one large section south and southeast of me which was mostly open blue sky (just a few small clouds).  This open area would be over the San Diego airport.  The clouds were moving southwest to northeast pretty fast.  I saw one round black object that was moving against the wind from north to south towards the San Diego airport.  This black object was not moving fast, but was clearly moving against the wind.  When I saw this object, it was not directly over me, but already southeast of me.  The black object was round and it appeared as a sphere.  At the time of the sighting, I could not tell how big it was; other than it was lar! ger than a weather balloon, but smaller than a commercial jet.  It was just below the few clouds that were in the open area.  These clouds were dipping a little, like it was raining up in the clouds, but the water was not hitting the ground.  The black object was traveling below the main part of the small clouds, but through the wispy part of the clouds that were dipping down.  This object, if it was a balloon or a floating object, would have been traveling with the clouds; but there was no doubt, none, the object was moving north to south against the wind.  This object was did not look like a disc, but more like it was round or a sphere.  I saw it for about one minute.  This object was round and black.  The black color did not reflect or shimmer; but maybe it was rotating.  I did not see it rotate, but there was a rhythmic change from solid black to something other than black.  It would be solid black most of the time, and then a reflective shimmer for a short time.  It was not like the reflective shimmer you see when there is an aluminum balloon floating by.  There are no words for it, but maybe half-way between simi-transparent and the aluminum reflective shimmer of a balloon.  I don\u2019t know if that makes sense; but the object was a solid black round object for most of the time, but then for a short few seconds, it would almost become transparent.  And then back to black, a very solid black.  I should have timed the rhythmic change; but I did not think of doing that during the sighting.  There were no lights on this object and it did not make any sound.  After a minute, it was too far away to see.  I did not have a camera with me.  I had that sighting yesterday afternoon in full sunlight.  I was not able to judge the size of the craft; but this morning, Sunday morning, a military transport jet flew by the same location at the same elevation, just below the clouds.  So now, since I just saw a jet about in the same location, the black object I saw yesterday would be the size of the tail wing section; but of course, filled in as a sphere. ((NOTE FROM VISITOR TO THE NUFORC WEBSITE)) Anyway it may be minor but I found one suspicious report in my own neighborhood or perhaps the reporter was just confused. San Diego, 9/22/2012 16:45.  Witness twice stated that the object that they witnessed  was \"South and Southeast\" of their location (In Mission Hills.) \"over the San Diego Airport\" ( Lindbergh Field?). That airport is SOUTHWEST of Mission Hills. Of course this could be a typo. They stated that the wind was from the southeast to general North, the exact opposite of the norm in this area but not unheard of. They further stated that this was one reason they were awed as the craft flew against the wind ( Eliminating balloons.). Well if the wind direction they described was accurate then aircraft landing at Lindbergh Field would in fact be landing in the direction of the craft sited. As this is unusual, likely the witness has rarely if ever seen aircraft in this pattern and mistook a final approach for an unknown object. I also note that the time, 16:45 is prime landing time at Lindbergh. ((END))",

      "story": "A brilliant white perfect circle changes to a circle within a circle and then becomes a distant dot in the sky On or about June 18, 1996 at 8:26AM, while travelling southbound on Interstate 15 (I-15) corridor in greater San Diego, California, and in the vicinity of formerly Naval Air Station, Mira Mar, and now the Marine Corps Air Station, Mira Mar, I saw in the southeastern morning sky a round circular object. At this time (1996), I lived in North County San Diego and worked for a private, not-for-profit, Institution of Higher Education (post-secondary), which was headquartered on and along Camino Del Rio South parallel to Interstate 8 (I-8). On regular work days, Monday-Friday, I commuted to and from work using I-15 corridor, and appropriate exits taking me to and away from my office location.  I had been using the I-15 corridor since 1991 and became familiar with smaller cities between my residence and place of work along the corridor. When approaching the vicinity of Mira Mar, my daily routine was to quickly scan the morning skies (while operating my vehicle), and look for Naval fighter jets in the skies practicing \u2018touch-and-go\u2019 maneuvers at the Air Station.  As memory serves, it was customary for the fighter jets, flight pattern, to circle and approach air strip from the east when landing or touching down. On the morning of June 18, I was scanning the morning skies but did not notice any \u2018human\u2019 craft in the air.  I assumed the Air Station had their jets down in hangers conducting maintenance on them.  I did however notice what appeared to be a brief glitter in the southeastern sky.  At first, I thought it might be the sun but the sun had already risen to higher elevation.  Then I thought it might be a commercial aircraft from San Diego International Airport at high altitude and the sun\u2019s rays reflecting off the fuselage of the craft. It suddenly appeared in the southeastern morning sky.  The object was a perfect circle, brilliant white in color but blinding to the eyes.  Using my thumb as a gauge and extending my arm out in the direction of the object, it was larger than my thumbnail and perhaps the size of a 25 cent coin (quarter).  It didn\u2019t move it hovered as if suspended in the air. I was driving approximately 65mph, keeping up with the traffic, and flailing my left arm out the window shaking my hand and pointing my fingers upward in the sky hoping other drivers would notice and see the object as well.  This is all taking place and happening within seconds, really.  I looking up briefly, driving, and trying to get others to look-up as well. The object changes!  What initially appeared as a brilliant white circle, suddenly changed and it became two circles or a circle within a circle.  The inner circle was white but it moved like gaseous steam, rolling over and over, and it was surrounded by an outer circle that was clear and translucent.  The space between the perimeter of the larger outer circle and the perimeter of the inner circle (the circle within a circle), was transparent and there was something like a heat wave that moved between the perimeters of the circles.  It reminded me of heat waves moving across a hot desert floor that can be seen from a distance. The object begins to move.  As quickly as the object appeared, hovered, changed, and reconstituted to its original state, it begins to move southwardly in the morning sky.  Within seconds what appeared to be an object the size of a quarter, moved and accelerated its speed and was now a mere white dot dancing in the distance. The sighting incident happened within seconds, and maybe slightly more than a minute?  I honestly do not know how much time elapsed.

Our opinion is that the lights are most like the strobes on an airliner, but the witness has stated that she did not see any aircraft in the sky, at the time she took the photograph.

I entered the Marine Corp in 1997, and that is the year the event took place.  I heard about this on Coast to Coast, and they said to report any event no matter how much time has elapsed.  I was in boot camp at MCRD San Diego, and during my thirteen weeks there, there are several times that we were taken to Camp Pendleton.   On this particular occasion we made our way there, and had to hump (hike) a mountain by the name of Old Smokey.  Old Smokey is a mountain on Camp Pendleton that was particularly high and steep.  Three quarters of the way up you have to basically crawl up the mountain it is so steep.  I remember actually passing through the clouds on the way up the mountain it is so high.   At approximately 21:00 hours my company was getting ready to go to bed when a huge craft appeared right above us.  It was so close it seemed as though we could almost touch it.  It hovered above us as though it was looking right at us.   There was about 200 Marines looking at this enormous craft, including enlisted and officers.   After about ten mins, we heard our helicopters, and jets heading right for the craft.  When our jets came within a couple of feet, the craft sped off with speed that I have never seen before.   After it left I\u2019ll never forget the beautiful blue like exhaust that floated in the air for about two hours.   The following day we were told by our commanding officer never to speak of what we saw.",

There was a transformer like hum coming from the front rounded triangle ahead of the other two rounded triangles in a right triangle formation a possible flight mode to fool the local airport with illusory and then all three rounded triangles made a ninety degree turn and made a run for the border I assume due to the fact a Navy jet was deployed off a aircraft carried and then their was a brief game of cat and mouse and all at once the three crafts with three centrifugal lights that formed three rounded tria! ngles immerged  back into one and pulled away from the navy jet at a very high rate of speed headed South towards Mexico.  I have never seen nothing like it.  You could always see the purple glow of the three fan looking motors of all to one and then a streak that left the Navy jet at I'd say at least 3800 miles per hour.  The Navy jet goes around 1300 miles per hour and this irregular large grey silver metallic spaceship went so fast it was like it disappeared right before my eyes.

At approximately 21:30 on Thursday, 8 August 2013, during a five minute period, fifteen separate and distinct airborne objects with identical bright white lighting emerged at low altitude from southeast of downtown San Diego, flew in a gentle climb initially at a moderate rate of velocity, then began a near vertical climb until I lost sight.  They were in a very loose trail formation and maneuvered very differently from conventional commercial or military aircraft.  The lighting on the objects was constant and non-flickering.  There were no conventional red or white anti-collision lights apparent on any of the objects.  There were no red, green, or white navigation lights evident on any of the objects.  This was in stark contrast to commercial passenger airliners approaching San Diego's Lindbergh Field for landing.  The lighting and flight paths of the objects were in stark contrast to the commercial airliners that appeared to fly under the formation of the objects.  Military helicopter flight operations at NAS North Island were also ongoing simultaneously and were in stark visual contrast to the objects.  The objects did not make any sounds or noise. I am a retired Marine aviator with 4000 hours of flying experience.  What I witnessed last night was like nothing I had ever seen before.  There has been no reporting of any sightings, as I described, in any of the local San Diego media sources.  I can't imagine that no one else saw the same sight.  Close to where I was standing, four other people saw the objects and were commenting on the sighting.  I was able to take two photographs with my iPhone camera that clearly show multiple flying objects above the San Diego skyline. Can this sighting be verified?",

I was taken from my bedroom by two tall beings that had human features and qualities. They took me aboard their craft gave me a tour of three floors explaining through mind non verbal communication what each are was for and their final discussion with me was events that were coming.  Showing me by a virtual reality show of their future response to events coming to our planet and our people.  I did not understand at that time that it was not coming then, I thought it was.  They did in no way harm me and in fact were very gentle, kind and loving, I was in no way afraid of them or ever felt threaten by them at all.  In fact I felt they were very much concerned for me and our planet.  They explained that they would be removing animals from our planet in order for life to continue. In 1974 I was  moving from PA. to CA. towing a trailer with the assistance of my brother I was 19 and he was 17 at that time.  Somewhere in the middle of farm country of OHIO at 3 am my brother was driving and I was awakened by his screaming my name.  The ford pinto I owned at the time was going on and off, all the lights engine and radio. Then all of a sudden it totally died.  Lights, radio engine completely shut down. We got a flashlight out of the glove box and got out lifted the hood to see what we could see, naive as  neither of us had a clue what we could do.  I suggested we get back in the car and what until morning and perhaps hitchhike to any near town as we were about 35 miles from any town.  So we just curled up to go to sleep and then there was a small red light that went flying over the nearby farm field in a flash. About 5 minutes later my car came back on radio, lights and engine started right back up.  Because everything had shut down we had not turned anything off so it just came right back on. From that day to the day I sold it I never had this ever occur again or any electrical problems. In 77 or 78 when Close Encounters of the Third Kind the movie came out my brother called me from calif to tell me to go see this movie without telling me why. And there in the movie was exactly what occurred to us.  I was never one who was someone who read any science fiction stories.  I may have been a Star Trek fan and I have always been a believer in all things are possible. But I was never one who was looking for these kind of encounters or interactions. I was recently living in Montana and had 4-5 encounters there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

Three objects moved across the eastern san diego sky right at the cloud line in very mild San Diego thunderstorm conditions.    At first the group of three moved in unison circling around in the clouds almost looking as if it was a very very low flying plane with one white light on the nose, and one on each wing.   I have seen large low flying planes circling exactly in the same manner at the Miramar air show and there is a considerable amount of noise when this happens.  These objects made no sound at all and after circling around several times within the clouds came out of the clouds and set still for a moment.   They then dramatically split/jumped into different directions in a manner impossible with airfoil lifted craft.  One headed north, the other went to the south. After 5 minutes they were gone, then we spotted them in unison again 3minutes later, now flying much closer to the horizon at a high rate of speed about the same as a fighter jet with the throttle pumping, along with the very loud noise that a fighter jet makes.  These objects again had no sound.  After another minute they were gone. I was trying to catch video of the three together but by accident only took a still shot and two of them are very clear in the picture.  It seemed that they were responsive to my actions because everytime I tried to get video they split up into singles or were out view which doesn't look nearly as compelling. 4 hours our area experienced a power outage affecting over 1200 homes in my area.

At first I thought it might be a traffic helicopter or a loose kite which had drifted away from its owner about 5 miles south of Mission Bay.   But as we approached the object, it was absolutely still as my wife and I drove underneath it, in our SUV. We had an extremely clear visual observance of the craft which made no sound at all. My wife remarked that it \u201cmight be a drone of some sort\u201d.  This was not a helicopter, kite, nor a \u201cdrone\u201d.   Oddly, the sky was just beginning to clear from a fog bank, and we had just passed the SD airport which still was engulfed in a layer of fog.  It didn't make sense for someone to be flying a kite in the fog at 6:40 in the morning nor a helicopter being in the sky with that much fog and being so low to the ground.  My Cruise ! control no longer functioned properly - it worked the day before.  Right after the encounter, I glanced back at our dog that we had in a cage in the back seat - she seemed a little restless and when I turned around to look at her - her left eye looked strange.

I was on my balcony looking west from Rancho Bernardo California, toward the hills above the neighborhood called Westwood, separating North County East from North County West and the Coast. Something caught my eye as flying toward me below the horizon of the hill. Being after dark, I first thought it was an unusually large bird with white tipped wings, but they began to glide north and moved above the horizon, one object began moving ahead and bit faster than the other. With the light of the horizon I began to get my depth of field and could see the two objects were moving north at an extremely fast rate of speed. They continued to remain between my location and the hills, so their distance was less than two miles away.  Their altitude continued to be much lower than the ceiling for the airplanes in the area. I have never seen a UFO before and there was no possible way these were airplanes or anything of earthly origin. They were not very large, but they were! not extremely small like the orbs occasionally described either. They were moving extremely smoothly and at a rate of speed even as they began to increase altitude, as if there was no resistance and the moved far faster than any aircraft we have and making no sound at all. Being so close, there should have been some sound. The movement was much more like gliding, only at an extremely high rate of speed. Just after the forward craft began to distance its self slightly from the craft in the rear, they both accelerated and disappeared heading north.  The light omitted from these craft was constant and white with no blinking or other coloration.  The craft themselves was dark or shadowy, and impossible to make out.  The lights were dimmer than I would have guessed from descriptions that I have heard of UFO sightings in the past and even compared to other aircraft in the area that were much higher and further away.  Due to the flight path of planes moving south from Los Angeles, th! ere were several airplanes in the area, although none in the direct pa th north, south or west of the craft.  The sighting lasted roughly 20-40 seconds.  I doubt very seriously that I was the only one to see these.",

I head out to the balcony to see what she was talking about and yes in fact there were 3 white lights in a triangle formation hovering in the sky, motionless,   The sky was very clear absolutely no clouds very calm wind and there was some air traffic but more than usual for the airport nearby you could clearly see what were clearly planes or a helicopter these lights were not a conventional aircraft.  Of the three the one in the center was the largest and had the most distinct shape, that of a diamond.   At first it appeared to be one large craft but after looking at it for about 3-4 minutes the lights began to separate and move away from each other slowly at first, then in a blink of an eye they seemed to have traveled a good distance from each other.  They stayed at a relatively far distance from each other at this time, and stayed in position from what seemed to be an expanded triangular formation.  At this point the lights went from whitish blue to flashing red, green, and blue.  Sometime after watching the lights sit in place for a while I heard a jet fly by south of the house I looked and did in fact see a jet, what was odd Is that this aircraft was at around the same distance away but I could hear it where as I could not hear the 3 strange objects when they moved.  Two more lights appeared after a while but these stayed closely together one was hovering over the other and to the side at a small distance almost like it was supervising over the object below it.  Some pictures and video was taken but the quality is not good the lights I observed can be seen but the shape is a bit distorted.  All the lights eventually began rising slowly straight up into the atmosphere and eventually disappeared. On a side note I did observe the house pets (cat and dog) acting very erratic, running around and specifically the dog running up my leg, 2 more dogs from some neighbors also began barking.",

      "story": "Ball/orb of light dripping &quot;liquid fire&quot; pulses and then streaks of into night sky While walking my dog as I do almost every night I witnessed an unexplainable, for me anyway, event in the sky. It was what some might call a fire ball or orb of light, but there was something else going on as well. Before I continue let me say that I live near a military air station, as well as a smaller but busy local airport. I am accustomed to seeing all manner of aircraft, both at night and during the day, such as; Osprey (with the rotors up like a helicopter), giant military transport planes, light/personal aircraft, small personal jets, fighter planes, and helicopters of all kinds.  I know very little about aviation but this was nothing I had ever seen before. This event happened in the eastern sky, and appeared to be fairly close.  It lasted about 10-12 seconds total, but was already happening when I looked up.  At first I thought what I was seeing was a meteor falling and burning up very close to the ground.  There seemed to be debris falling and burning up in the sky like something breaking up. However, after maybe half a second or so, I noticed two things.  1) It was not falling but stationary.  2) The brightest point of light was at the top.  At that point I thought maybe a firework. The debris, for lack of a better word, was almost \u201cdripping\u201d from the ball/orb of light.  It seemed to have a liquid quality to it.  Not at all like what you would associate with a firework.  It almost looked like burning/melting plastic being poured or dripping/falling into the night sky. I then thought maybe it was a lantern burning up and the dripping was just thin paper on fire and swirling around, and the ball/orb of light was the heat source for the lantern.  But the ball of light remained stationary and the \u201cliquid fire\u201d kept falling; so much that it would be hard to believe this was all paper from a lantern or that the lantern would even be able to maintain its elevation while loosing that much of its structure.  The same would go for any aircraft. It was just so much fire.  It also did not seem to be consistent with what I have witnessed as a flare. At this point it has been maybe 3-3.5 seconds.  The origin of the \u201cliquid fire\u201d began to glow very bright and appeared to grow larger.  It also, at this point, started to pulse alternating between a dimmer light red-orange color and a full, bright true-orange color.  The \u201cliquid fire\u201d increased in volume and also seemed to pulse along with the ball/orb of light. It stayed this way, very bright, for a couple of 2-3 seconds and then the dripping \u201cliquid fire\u201d stopped.  The ball/orb grew even brighter and more well defined. It pulsed a couple more times; finally sticking with the red-orange color, and shot off heading east at a very high rate of speed.  I could see it for 3-4 seconds before it was too small to be visible anymore. There was no sound that I would say could be attributed to this event.  This is in a suburban area and near a highway so there is ambient noise.  However, it is also in a valley and air traffic is usually amplified not muffled or masked.",

I was driving over a bridge when I saw something strange in the sky about 1 to 2 miles away towards the beach.  I looked at it for about 30 seconds, while trying to show my friend what I was looking at.  He couldn't see what I was seeing:  a round orb flouting in the sky.  It wasn't anything recognizable, i.e. plane, helicopter or drone. I told my friend to take some pictures with his I-phone but he couldn't see what I was talking about so I told him to steer the car while I took the pictures.  I was able to get two pictures through my windshield and one with the window on the driver's side rolled down. There wasn't a place to pull over and when I finally could pull over the object had disappeared.",

It made about three passes.   Not unusual, there are helicopters out every night.  I thought the helicopter would report anything unusual and I would read about it in the morning.

I was outside after 8 PM doing a skywatch with night vision googles from my backyard in southeast ,san diego.  Observed a number of what I would say are standard satellite crossings in the sky.  Some small, very faint, some bright, and seen by the naked eye.  These are very common sightings in the sky on a nightly basis.   Looked away from the goggles to speak to my wife, who was inside the house, to not let the cat out.  Upon looking throughout the goggles again, spotted a group of three dim lights, ( triangle in form) moving very quickly across my field of view, heading from the east, to the southwest.  I was looking south at the time.  It was very clearly three lights moving in a triangle formation.  At first , steady, as if it were a flat object flying level, and then the lights moved in relation to each other as if it banked to the side, and then, just before disappearing behind the small pepper tree in my yard, the lights started moving apart! from each other.   I was very disappointed that  the tree cut off any more viewing of what these objects did. I estimate the time that I saw all of this is about 5 seconds.   I have been a sky watcher for many years and have attended a number of UFO conferences to boot.  My house is directly over the flight path to Lindberg Airport and enjoy watching all the various types of aircraft that come here.  From helicopters to blimps to all the various planes and jets that move, including satellites that criss cross the night sky  and  the occasional pass of the space Station.  After all these years, I have finally seen with my own eyes, what I have only read about from other people experiences.   It was a profound \u2026.Wow.

I was looking NNW, when a neon blue light came into my field of vision.  Again, it was mostly a neon blue, but there was a much smaller red light glow or light too.  The red light was about one quarter the size as the neon blue or smaller.  The light was as large and as bright as the landing light of an incoming jet preparing to land at the San Diego airport.  The light did not blink off and on as the anti-collision lights do.  It was a steady light.   Anyway, this light was moving very fast from the east to the west when it came into my field of vision.  Within 3 seconds it was NW of me and made a 180 degree turn.  It came back east a little and then went almost straight down but at a slight angle.   It disappeared for 20 seconds or so behind the tree line across the canyon and then came back up for 10 seconds.  It moved in a swimming motion in different directions.  Then down again below the tree line; almost straight down, but again at a slight angle.  This was not a long way away from me; it was close.  The light was closer than the planes coming south towards the San Diego airport.  When the planes are preparing to land, they get close to the airport and turn or head east along the Interstate 8 freeway corridor before turning back to the San Diego airport.   So, this light was moving much faster than the planes preparing for their approach to the airport and of course was closer to me than the Planes heading east along the Interstate corridor.  This light was also lower than the incoming jets and planes at all times in this sighting and must have come down close to the ground in order for me to loose sight of it, twice, behind the tree line across Dove Canyon (western finger of Dove Canyon).   This light moved gracefully, but not in straight lines.  It moved slightly erratically, a little like a d! olphin swimming rather than straight lines.  When it made a 180 degree turn, it was almost instantaneously.  This obviously was not a plane or helicopter.  If it was a drone, it would have to have been a jet powered drone, but that is not possible either, since there was no sound.",

As I continued to watch this light in the eastern sky, it seemed to change color and the light almost looked as if it was revolving on top of whatever this thing was. The next strange thing I noticed is that it was making no sound what so ever, and was definitely close enough that if it had been a helicopter or other commercial aircraft, it definitely would have been making noise. I continued to watch this thing travel to the south when it made a total hairpin 90 degree turn and almost seemed to change shape as it went behind the tree.  I got up and went into my front yard and continued to watch this light change color and make what looked to be impossible movements in the sky, but traveling now to the east/southeast. The craft appeared to lower up and down a few times, and then go back to the south.  It changed from blue/green to white and then to red before it traveled out of my vision behind a row of trees.

My observation was from the 70 deg point to 35 deg..  The travel time was approx 10 min.   I used my 7X50 binocs to further investigate the object.  The shape appeared to be a pipelike cylnder (a ratio of 10 to 1 length to width).  It also had some sort of an arrow shaped tip.   It appeared to be at a very high altitude, perhaps space and therefore the object appeared quite small.  It continued to drift south.   I believe  it may have been some object (junk) in space that was rotating and reflecting the sunlight.   We often observe the ISS (at night), which is a fast moving object, lasting no longer than 6 min in transit..",

      "story": "4th of July surprise. First off, I'm not crazy.  I don't hunt UFOs or even believe in ghosts.  I have seen questionable lights in the sky, even 6 of them 30ft away from me but I still question those and can't confirm they were alien or UFOs.  But this one is different,.  It had dimension and reflected the ground.  Plus it moved. It was on the 4th of July 2005. I was at a holiday party, in the back yard of the house next to a swimming pool.  Ever since I was a kid, I usually like looking at planes take off and land.  So when I was in the back yard and heard an approaching plane, I instinctively looked up.   While I was facing north. I heard to the left of me, a plane approaching.  So I looked at it and thought, \"cool, a C130 military plane is approaching\".  Which made it even more interesting to look at.  Right behind the plane was a small round object. My first thought was that the lane was towing something.  As it got closer and closer, I kept looking for a tow line, a chord, a rope, a wire,... something to make sense that it was towing this round object.  Then as it was almost right above me, I saw that the object was shiny with a chrome-like reflection.  That's when it hit me that this is the orb stuff I've heard of in the past.  So I opened the sliding back door and yelled for people to come out! and see this cause I didn't want to be the only one seeing this.  They all tool their time to come out cause they thought I was crazy.  While they were coning, I tried to pull my Iphone out to take a picture or video, but the stupid phone took a long time to boot up and initiate the camera.  While I was waiting, the plane had already past me and moved on to my right.  So I'm looking at the back of the plane now.  I can still see the orb behind it, but it started to move slowly to the left of the plane.  So I naturally freaked out some more.  By the time I got the camera working, the plane was too far to see anything and the people who came outside to see couldn't make out anything themselves.  That's my story of what happened.",

      "story": "Second craft by the International Space Station as it passed by San Diego, California 18 June 2015 I was standing in the West Lewis Mini Park in Mission Hills, which is part of San Diego.   At 10:33pm I saw a faint satellite coming from the NW and heading SE.  Since most satellites I see usually are flying either N-S, S-N, E-W or W-E; I guessed it was probably the International Space Station.   As it got closer to being almost directly overhead, I noticed there was not just one light, but a second light traveling the same path and speed.  The second light was the leading light and was dimmer.  At an arm's length, the 2 lights were only the width of my thumb apart.   I checked the time when I saw the 2 lights.  It was 10:33pm.  I went inside and checked the ISS TRACKER web page, and sure enough, the space station had passed by San Diego at that time.   I have seen the space station pass overhead several times, but this was the first time I saw another craft by the space station.   I checked the NASA web page, and there was a Russian space craft docked with the space station earlier in the day.  In fact, they had a planned and successful space burn earlier in the day to change the space station orbit.  The article I saw did not mention if the Russian space craft that was docked at the space station was planned to undock yesterday.   Maybe someone else can figure out when or if the Russian space craft left the space station before my sighting.   Anyway, I have pasted part of the NASA article that was posted on June 18.  The International Space Station got an orbital boost this morning after a docked Russian re-supply craft fired its engines for four minutes and eight seconds.  One more re-boost is scheduled for July 10, when the station will be at the proper altitude for a new Soyuz crew to dock at the end of July.  The crew onboard the orbital laboratory conducted a wide array of experiments today looking at such things as radiation, liquid crystals and life science.   The trio of station residents also continued more eye checks with assistance from specialists on the ground.  One-Year crew member Mikhail Kornienko participated in the Matroyshka and RADI-N studies monitoring space radiation and exploring how it affects station crew members. 6055 : 08 : 39 : 00 Station Time in Orbit  Benefits to You NASA Astronauts Headline Public Events in Washington Area.

The orb moved downwards in a line perpendicular to the horizon, and it seemed to get brighter as it fell closer.   At first it moved in a linear fashion, so I thought it was a shooting star or that Halloween asteroid, but it was moving too slowly and seemed too close to be a celestial object.   After about a minute watching the red orb, it changed color to a pale grey and was difficult to see in the night sky.  The shape of the orb seemed more disk like at this point and it changed direction from south to west - a maneuver that both my friend and I had not seen any planes or helicopters do.  The dim, grey disk moved slowly and we thought we had lost sight of it, but it was distinct and clearly not something we were used to seeing move in the night sky.  It changed direction from west to south again, but appeared to move away from us instead of closer as it had when it was bright red... and then we lost sight of it.",

Then quite quickly the light flashed brighter like an explosion, and then I could see a trail of debris or sparks spread out behind the light.  If the light was half an inch wide in the sky the debris field was 4 inches about.  I was pointing to other drivers saying \"are you seeing this?\", and then the light changed colors to white/blue-ish and started to travel towards me.  The light then expanded in a concentric circle from the center like when you see a plane hit mach speed, - so the center light is there with this ring around expanding slowly, and this starts to fade.

      "story": "Large blue glow and related light/craft seen over sky in Sorrento Valley/Mira Mesa. ((NUFORC Note:  US Navy missile launch.  PD)) At approximately 6:03pm I received a call from my friend who was delivering a pizza in the Mira Mesa area, where I live. He told me that there was a bright greenish/blue spot in the sky and it was unlike any atmospheric anomaly he had ever witnessed in San Diego. \tI walked out front of my house and looked around, and spotted it immediately as it was VERY vivid. The sky was pretty clear that night so it looked like an oval indigo cloud just hanging in the middle of the atmosphere west of my position, presumably over Sorrento valley or maybe La Jolla. I confirmed on the phone that I saw it too and walked into the street a bit to get a better view. \tI spotted a formation below and to the right of the cloud, not moving in the sky. It was far away and hard to see unless I looked at in my peripherals, but I could define at least one white/red pinpoint light and what appeared to be another but was too dim and too far to visibly distinguish. There could have been a cluster of them but I couldn't get my telescope out in time to see. In between the formation was a faint stream of light running vertically, looking like a stream of glowing fog. The formation would become brighter and dimmer periodically, staying in the same spot. \tOver time the blue light cloud got harder and harder to see, and the formation below began to tilt clockwise, about 30-45 degrees before I lost track of it. I observed the two from the roof of my house until they slowly faded away and eventually disappeared.  I can't be certain of it but I believe the source of the blue glow was the formation I saw below, or it was possibly projected from the ground at Miramar MCAS nearby.",

There was a lead light with 2 lights on the right and 1 light on the left.   These evenly spaced lights formed a chevron.  These lights were very dim.  They were yellow white in color.  I could see there was a solid craft in between the lights and behind the lights; but the lights were too dim to illuminate the outer edges of the craft, so I can't really say what exactly the shape of the craft was.  I can only say for sure that there was a solid craft in between and behind the lights.   The craft was partially illuminated by the dim yellow white lights, but also from the city lights.  This craft was very low.  It must have been under 500 feet.  I first saw it in the NW.  It flew almost directly over me; maybe at 85 degrees, at its closest point.  It was completely silent.  It was moving fast.  I first saw it just coming from the NW and it was going out of view being blocked by houses within 4 or 5 seconds.   There were other aircraft visible on the horizon; but this area of the sighting is near the San Diego airport, so there are almost always aircraft in the horizon.",

      "story": "I was sitting on my front porch, when I witnessed two objects flying from south to north at an apparent high rate of speed, at about 50-55 degrees in the western sky.  There was absolutely no sound and they appeared as perhaps the brightness of an average star with a fuzzy-red quality to them.   Earth-bound aircraft must have strobe lights.  These had none.  One sped into view going in a straight line and, within one second, another followed even faster, catching up to the first one.  They then diverged from one another, making several immediate and instantaneous sharp angle turns.  This is something our aircraft cannot even come close to achieving.  It was as if they were doing aerial maneuvers in a somewhat playful way.  At one point it appeared like they might run into each other.   I cannot tell how fast they were moving because I do not know how far away they were.  One is a function of the other.  My best educated guess would be they were one mile away which would put their speed at something like 600 mph.  I base this on seeing airplanes flying at a given pace at 30,000 feet knowing they are moving at 500-600 mph.  However, they could have been 20 miles away putting their speed 20 times faster, or 12000 mph. Both scenarios are equally plausible.   The whole viewing lasted maybe 5-10 seconds and it was frustrating that I couldn't see it over and over again in a rewind/play/rewind fashion.  It leaves more questions than answers....Could these have been drones?  That thought entered my head but I've seen drone flight aerodynamic characteristics on line and there is no way they come close to what I saw....I was just lucky enough to have been looking at the right section of the sky at precisely the right moment.",

Because the sun was not up I could not tell if the object was in our atmosphere although it was not severely refracting light as it would if it wasn't.  It appeared to be at a very high altitude and was travelling at a velocity inconsistent with the speed of commercial jets.  The moving sphere was round and looked like a planet.   I ran to my daughter's room so she could witness it too by the time we returned (15 seconds at most it was gone).  That time period would not have been long enough for object to breach the horizon.

While starting to drive my car away from a party at 9:45 pm, Saturday, May 21, in the Mission Hills area of San Diego, I saw what was like a constellation of bright white stars, maybe about 12, in the area clear of trees above the street, towards the west.  I thought to myself, \"What\u2019s Cassiopeia doing there, and the Big Dipper, too low in the sky and in the wrong direction.\"   I pulled my car over and got out, and saw that the lights were slowly moving from west to east. Seeing them in motion was quite a shock. Not planes, not helicopters, just steady bright white lights floating slowly to the north of where I was, from west to east.   I ran back to the house and told everyone to come out to see what was happening.  The 15 or so still there came outside onto the driveway and sidewalk to watch the show.  The lights seemed to be drifting, slightly changing position in relation with one another.  They seemed to be slowly ascending as they moved east they neared the posi! tion of the full Moon, which had risen about an hour or two earlier.  They gradually faded from sight.  A retired policeman was among the witnesses.   Our guess on the most mundane side was that they could have been balloons with attached lights, launched from Ocean/Mission/or Pacific Beach and were riding the nightly onshore breeze which was taking them to the east, directly over Mission Bay then Mission Valley to our north.   I later went to Ocean Beach and asked fishermen on the north side of the pier if they had see balloons launched from the long stretch of these three above beaches to the north, but none had seen anything.  I recall seeing in the news a similar report of floating lights a year or two ago, also in San Diego.   I was just visiting in San Diego for the weekend, from Minneapolis, for my brother\u2019s memorial service.",

While flying kites at Tecolote Shores park, I happened to notice a fleet of 20-30 UFOs in the sky that appeared very similar to images and video of UFO fleets over Mexico City.  These craft seemed very high altitude since planes passed near them and were obviously well underneath the UFO swarm.   The UFO fleet appeared to be made of craft that were somewhat round and seemed to either reflect white light or create their own white light.  Individually, they appeared like points of white light in the clear, bright-blue, early-afternoon, southern California sky.   Also, some of crafts appeared to be larger and brighter than others.  One of the larger craft was observed emitting a smaller/dimmer craft.  Some of the smaller/dimmer craft were in tight formations and created geometric patterns like the three corners of triangles or triangles with an exact center light.   Over about 30 minutes the fleet drifted from the eastern sky towards the West.  The fleet expanded and some ! witness claimed they saw some of them suddenly disappear.   A few people tried to get video or photographs, but the kites in the sky and overall sunny early afternoon conditions would not allow our phone cameras to zoom in enough or focus on the formation.",

It was early New Years morning and I fell asleep around 10pm on New Year's Eve I was home alone my wife was working at la Jolla shores bath and tennis club.  She called and woke me up around 01:15 New Years morning and asked to be picked up in 30 minutes.  I walked out of my apartment at 2636 grand avenue in San Diego. I walked down the walkway to my car parked on the north side of the building.  On my way to the car I looked up and noticed several Amber lights moving slowly over the la Jolla hills to the north. I thought it strange, but San Diego being a big military city I figured that it was helicopters or some military aircraft. I got in my jeep with the top down and headed north on the I 5 from pacific beach and noticed the lights again as I approached the la Jolla parkway exit and noticed there were 7 or 8 Amber lights at what seemed like an altitude of about 1000 feet above the hill moving extremely slowly from east to west in a sloppy triangle formation! with the rear light occasionally leapfrogging to the front of the formation. It seemed the lights were slightly ahead of me as I proceeded onto la Jolla parkway towards the north west and when I got to the top of the hill and stopped at the traffic light at the intersection of la Jolla parkway and la Jolla shores drive the lights appeared to stay stationary directly above me at an estimated altitude of 1000-2000 feet.  I did not hear any noise other than traffic whatsoever. At this point I concluded if they were helicopters I would surely be hearing them.  I turned north on la Jolla shores drive and proceeded Approximately 1/2 mile to the bath and tennis club and my wife was waiting curbside and got in the jeep. I turned around to a south heading and told my wife about the lights and pointed them out to her. She thought them strange as well. At that time they seemed about 1/2 mile to the west and picking up steady speed. By the time I got back to the traffic light 1/2 mile! south at la Jolla shores drive and la Jolla parkway the light! s seemed at least 5 miles out to sea already and continuing west/northwest. I turned to head east and lost sight of the lights by the time I reached my apartment again about 4-5 minutes later I could not find the lights again",

We watched what seemed to be a satellite cross the sky, moving from the west to the east.  It had a slight orange color, being about as bright as Mars.  Its speed was a little faster than a satellite.   As it moved east, toward the moon, I lost track of it in the glow of the moon.   I expected it to emerge from the glow on the other side-at the same speed but, when it reappeared, it became brighter and like a meteor, it dropped down at a sharp angle back to the west.   Then it completely disappeared.  The distance it dropped was about the length of a finger at arms length.    We didn't see anything afterward.

While looking at stars with my dad, we saw what we thought was a satellite crossing the sky, from west to east.  It appeared slightly orange, about the same brightness and color as Mars.  It was travelling at a speed similar to a satellite--but a little faster.  It moved east, getting closer toward the moon, until it was lost in its glow.  It was just above the moon when it disappeared in the glow.  We expected it to emerge from the glow on the other side but, when it came out of the glow, it suddenly got brighter and at about the speed of a meteor, dropped down diagonally, angled backwards to the west (like a backwards \"7\")  and then suddenly disappeared.

I walked out to my patio and saw a black triangle hovering over murphy canyon area just south of   Browns field.  I have seen this craft before and I have no doubt it was a tr-3b.  I filmed one in El Cajon, CA on 12-30-12. It was a black triangle with lights on all 3 points and one larger light ball in the middle.  It hovered for about a minute and went south slowly dissapearing in the haze before it returned from the same direction in a slow zig-zag pattern.  Then I witnessed a brilliant flash and explosion sound.  My camera recorded the flash, but it was not aimed at the craft at the time.  Upon reviewing the film the flash was actually three very quick bursts of extremely bright light. It then dissapeared to the south west towards south park and I lost sight again.  In the distance were 2 or 3 more flashes and there were thunder claps as well, but again. and again, there was briliiant flashes and some more thunder claps.  So I don't know for sure if the flashes and noise were related to the triangular craft I saw, but I know what I saw was a hovering craft.  There possibly was two of them it was hard to tell due to the 50% visibility.",

      "story": "Triangle Pattern Of Lights Off San Diego Coastline From the beach in Oceanside, CA, 25 miles north of Mt Soledad (La Jolla), I observed the formation of lights described by \"the pilot\" in the other report.   I was driving down Pacific Coast Highway, when I noticed the triangle pattern of 3 extremely bright yellow orange lights.  I drove to a beach parking lot adjacent to Wisconsin Street in Oceanside to get a clear view over the ocean of the lights.  Other people there at the beach were observing the lights as well and remarking that they seemed strange.  The lights appeared to be 5  to 10 miles off the San Diego coast over the ocean due West of La Jolla.  The lowest light of the triangle pattern may have been 5,000 to 7,500 feet in altitude.  The 2 upper lights of the triangle formation were not level, and may have been in the 10,000 to 12,500 altitude range.  The triangle was large and the lights were much brighter in intensity than any aircraft landing lights would have been at that distance.  I tried to t! ake a picture with my cel phone camera but the images did not register.  All of us present observed the light pattern for about 10 minutes, then one seemed to turn off.   I drove off, continuing Southward on Pacific Coast Highway towards home, and when I looked about 10 minutes later the lights were gone.  My thought was the lights may have been some type of signal flares and perhaps the Navy was conducting some sort of training or practice exercise off of the San Diego coast.  I have seen signal flares in the night sky at Camp Pendelton and they slowly descend and weaken as they drop.  These lights did not descend and were at least 10x's brighter or more than any signal flare I've seen.  I've done a couple of Google searches and couldn't find any mention or explanation.   When I came across the other report from \"the pilot\" on Mt Soledad, I realized we had observed the same lights, and decided to file this report.  I do not believe earth has ever been visited by \"extraterrestrials\", I believe there is a man made explanation of  these lights.",

The event started around 1800hrs to early morning 0300hrs, there where around 150-200 boys, and a number of scout leaders, with me.   We where hiking to a creek where we where going to sleep under the stars on the creek bed.  Soon after we got to the creek, we noticed that there were large rocks being thrown into the creek.  At first, we thought that the rocks where being thrown by some of the other boys.  That was not the case, since one of the boys got hit with a good size rock.  Then we noticed that the rocks where being thrown over 100 foot trees into the creek.  With that, we decided to line up in single file and sweep the wood line.  The wood line was around 60 feet or so thick, on the other side of wood line was a large open field there was no one there.  We where all shocked.   The scoutmasters decided to bed down on the creek bed cause it was too dangerous to go back in the dark, for thee boys got hurt during the sweep of the wood line.  We where instucted to dig into the creek bed, and cover our heads with our hiking back packs to shield us from the rocks, and we went to sleep.   At some point in the night I woke and saw two object with lights, blue, green and yellow, floating off center of each other up and down. the objects where cone shaped top and bottom with three lights in the middle, one on top and one light on the bottom of the objects.  I tried scream to my scoutmaster who was next to me, but I could not speak,  I could not move, then black.  I do not rember anything after that.  I believe I have two implants [pending on x-rays]. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere, in his recounting of the incident.

So, I was driving home this evening, and as I was pulling into the alley where I park, I could clearly see an orange light in the sky.  It was nighttime already, clear and the object was very easy to see.  It seemed stationary for the most part, until I parked and took out my camera to film.   At this point the object began to move from a northern direction towards the west rather slowly and horizontal.  I begin filming but could tell the image was hazy on my phone and did not resemble what I was actually seeing.   I heard people talking outside, so I just stopped filming and just looked at this object.  I'll try my best to describe.  It was an orange sphere and had an orange glow.  There seemed to be like darker orange lines In the center that made either a diamond or triangle shape.  It seemed as though something was in the center.  So, as the object moved, I'm questioning what it is, etc., and it begins to fade away.  It completely fades and then becomes visible again.  It was really odd.   It continues to move and does the same thing again (fades out/in) after a couple hundred feet of movement.  By this time it flew in front my apartment and I couldnt see it.  I walked south out of my alley to see if it were there and it was.  It flew at a slow rate towards the west and that was it.",

      "story": "Very small round object at first stationary then moved to new position, then disappeared as I watched it against a bright blue sky. I sighted an unidentified moving object from the shore of Ocean Beach San Diego California at about 2 pm October 27.  Duration of sighting was less than 10 minutes. On this day the weather was very hot and dry as Santa Ana weather gave way to clear unlimited visibility and a cloudless bright blue sky.  I was laid on my back on the sandy beach so naturally I was looking skyward.  My feet were pointed straight to the surf so my body was aligned northwesterly looking out to sea.  The 2 pm sun was about 40 degrees to my left. As I watched an airliner pass by at mid altitude (10,000 feet) I noticed it pass by a small white spot in the sky.  The spot was roundish, stationary, and had the washed out white color the moon has on a sunny day.  This lead me to think I was looking at Venus or some other celestial object though I was skeptical as I have never seen any celestial object in the bright day sky other than the moon. For the next several minutes I stared at the spot for a short while and then look away for a minute and look back up again still puzzled at what I was looking at.  Each time I looked back up relocating it took a few moments as the small spot was difficult to see against the bright blue sky so I figured I should point straight at it so I could better relocate it the next time I looked away.  I pointed about 20 degrees to my right and about 20 degrees forward (from my laying down position). I then looked away for a short while and looked back up to relocated the spot but I did not see it. I pointed my finger in the direction I had just pointed a moment ago but the spot was gone.  Now I became very curious. I scanned the sky for a few seconds and I located the spot.  The spot was stationary but was then about 15 degrees to my left. Now my attention was peaked. Now I could rule out Venus or any other celestial object.  I stared intently at the spot for about 10 or 15 seconds when suddenly it appeared to move very slightly.  Slight movement was hard to tell against a bright blue background, so I extended my left hand and finger to try and gauge movement.  In the next few seconds I confirmed the spot was moving slightly, grew in brightness, then dim and vanish.  End of story. As the observer, I want to note that I am an adult with fine far vision (no glasses).  I had sunglasses on and viewed the object with and without my sun glasses.  I was not under the influence of any drug, alcohol, or medication.",

I saw an object just to the right of my home and seemed to be hovering slightly above and behind my next door neighbor's home.  The object reflected the late afternoon orange glow. The sky was clear that evening.  At first I thought it may be a globe commonly seen hanging on power lines, but then realized there were no power lines in that area.  I could see no means of flight and there was absolutely no sound coming from the object.  I thought it was about 500 ft above the ground and I could see some details.  It appeared to be a small object about 4-6 ft in diameter.  The object appeared to gently sway as if impacted by a breeze, of which there was very little.  It eventually drifted away to the Southwest and out of sight. I went inside and got my camera and took almost 3 dz photos.  Also during the observation, I picked up my video camera and took about 12 min of video of the object toward the end of my sighting.  I observed the object for about 45 min in total (according to the time and date stamps on my photos).  I had to move my position to a different part of my backyard in order to continue to track the object as it drifted away. Finally it became too dark to track.  Also I forgot to take my video camera out of auto focus, so as it got darker and the leaves of the trees moved, the object appears to go in and out of focus.  That was my error. The first 2-3 min were observed without equipment.  Then I secured my camera(s) for the remainder of the time.  When I put the photos on my computer I could see more detail and noted 3 antenna or rods attached to the object.  There is an airport a few miles away and airplanes were flying in the background, but none came near or even close to the object.",

I went out to my balcony to look at the sunset, which I do every evening, and I noticed a cigar shaped (glowing bright white) object, hovering in a vertical position.  It caught my eye because it was so bright.  There wasn\u2019t a cloud in the sky, so it was easy to see. When I started to focus on the object, it rotated to a 2 o\u2019clock position, and then started to descend in a slow, deliberate manner.  As it descended, it rotated to a horizontal position, as it was moving south.  It descended to a few hundred feet off the ground, and then continued to move in a somewhat straight line, until it disappeared behind some trees in the distance. I live in San Diego, CA, approximately 3 miles from the ocean.  The object looked to be a few miles off the coast.  Also, as it was moving south, a commercial airliner flew in front of it (on video).  It gives a good perspective of how large it was.  Even though the object was a few miles west of the airplane, it seemed to be as large, or bigger than the plane.",

The sky was clear and there were no other objects in the blue sky except a large view of the moon off to the west. I was looking almost overhead when I saw the object and what appeared to be a bright light coming from it.  I thought it might be a reflection from the sun.  I got my binoculars but the image was still not very clear, but I could see the basic shape and that it had 5 lights - not reflections.  I set up my camera and tripod to catch the object as it was slowly moving away, now at about a 45 degree angle.  I got 5 quick photos before the object was too far away to focus.  It drifted off to the southwest.  No sounds or movement/change in the lights on the object.",

They were nothing like anything I've seen, very bright yellow, 5 times the size of an average star, and they were unmistakeably still, not moving at all.  They were constantly flickering, but not completely on and off.  Similar to a candle flicker.   I waited for them to fall or  move but they stayed still so I called my mom brother and sister to come see and we watched them stay still for about a whole minute.   Then I went to get my phone and captured the last seconds before they disappeared, one by one.  The one that was separated from the four and lower disappeared first.  It just started to dim until it was gone.   Then the other 4 followed.  They disappeared while in place.

      "story": "Bright Object Behaving Strangely. I was speaking with a family member on the phone and walked over to my glass patio door to look outside.  A bright object in the sky at about the 11:00 position and to the west caught my attention.  That would put it over the Pacific Ocean.  It was very bright, but was not shimmering like a star.  I\u2019ve seen Venus hundreds of times and this was probably 2 times the size of Venus.  It was roughly diamond shaped (with no defined edges) and had an orange-ish tinge.  It was also much too low to be a star as I could make out the thin, broken layer of high clouds behind it.  So, my first thought was that it was a helicopter, especially given that there is occasionally police helicopter activity in the area and the altitude seemed about right.   I continued to watch it, expecting that the object would turn/move soon and I would see its aviation lights, but it just remained in the same position for about 15 minutes.  Then I thought I saw it wavering sideways just a bit, so I lined up the edge of a palm tree with the object, and sure enough, it had a very subtle back-and-forth horizontal motion to it.  I never saw any aviation lights.  I still assumed it was probably a helicopter, and I was still having a conversation on the phone, so I didn\u2019t open the door to see if I could hear a faint rotor sound in the distance.  Actually with all of the other city noise (i.e., nearby freeway, local traffic) and with the distance, listening for a sound from the object would have given an inconclusive result.   I continued to watch it and was about to lose interest, when things got even stranger.  The object faded out in place for a brief moment and then grew bright again, matching its original size and intensity.  It was like a light bulb on a dimmer switch and you quickly turn down the voltage to the point where the bulb goes out and then you increase the power until the bulb is at full brightness again.   At first I thought perhaps the effect was caused by clouds p! assing in front of the object, but again the clouds were much higher a nd quite thin.  After a few more minutes, the object started becoming smaller and smaller, until it was a tiny spec in the distance.  This had a very different visual look than the dimming.  This time it appeared more like the object flew away at a level trajectory (further out over the ocean) and then stopped.  This changed took only a matter of seconds.   I watched it in the distance for a minute or so and thought there was nothing more to see, so I looked away for another minute or two.  When I looked up at the sky again, the object was back, in the exact location described at the beginning of this report and with the same shape and brightness.   After a few more minutes, it did the same maneuver again \u2013 appearing to move away very rapidly at a horizontal/level trajectory with the object becoming a tiny spec in the distance at the same location as before, except this time it completely disappeared. About halfway into this event, I noticed what were obvious airplanes (aviation lights visible) slowly circling far away from the object while it was in its original/stationary position.  It seems that these airplanes had their approach to the San Diego airport interrupted.  I say that because once the object disappeared as described above, an unusually high volume of airplanes started flying through the original area where the object was.  These airplanes were clearly headed to the airport.  //End of Report//",

There were three or four rows of white circles with 4-5 circles in each row flying together in a very tight formation. The rows were all equal in number and each craft was the same size. The last row was missing two from the formation. The white circles were not glowing, did not have any other color or any other distinct other surface, each one was the same with no difference in size or shape.  They looked like white frisbees and from my perspective in the plane, were about the size of a Certs peppermint candy. In comparison, houses on the ground looked to be lightly larger.  The objects cast a shadow on the ground as did my plane as the weather was completely cloudless and sunny. I sighted the formation and since we were flying in opposite directions my view from the plane was very short.",
