(I had just let my dogs out in the backyard to go to the bathroom.)  The \"star\" was high in the sky, approximately 60 degrees or so from the horizon. The \"star\" then began to move.  It's movement is best described as squirmy and its form was constantly changing.  Small points of light dispersed from it, remaining very close and then it would all fuse back together.  It was \"ever changing\" in a constant state of flux. The \"star\" moved to the right and upward over the course of 2-3 minutes.  It covered a distance approx. twice the size of my double garage.  The garage is approx. 40-60 feet from my kitchen window. Soon after a light haze of clouds covered the sky and the \"star\" disappeared.",

      "story": "The following sighting reports are very similar to the one my mother, father, North Minneapolis and I had back in 1975. This is the second time it's happened to a friend of mine, his story:   He said he was walking home from the store during the Monday night snowstorm and as he approached his building, he noticed three women in high-school cheerleader mini-skirts walking silently behind him (he mentioned that they were silent because he said that he only heard his own footfall as it crunched into the snow). When he turned back around he noticed what he first thought to be alot of police cars. Then he said because of the size of it, maybe a large construction crew working on Lyndale Ave N.  As he climbed the steps of his building, he noticed that the women had lined up side-by-side, standing at the foot of the steps but were facing and staring at the \"construction sight\".   Everything was silent and this is when he said he got the sudden urge to run into the building.  He said he went straight to the Recreation Room because the window there gives you a direct sight to the street where the \"construction sight\" and the women were.   This is when he got a clear view of what he said was this huge object hovering over the street about tree level.  It was silent, black, or either a very dark color, and had a row of flashing, dancing, lights running along the bottom perimeter of it.  He said what was also astonding is that the object was about as large as a football field.  ' He also noticed that the street--which is usually busy--did not have ANY traffic at all.  (I was born and raised there too so I know this particular street and it is ALWAYS busy--just like a freeway.)  He said he then started running around inside the building to all his neighbor's, knocking on their doors trying to get someone to come and see the object--finally finding someone after approximately 15 minutes.  He said he told this person, \"Man, come and see this shit!\"  But when they got to the window, the craft was gone.  He said the guy then asked him, \"What shit?\", and my friend said he told him, \"Man...NEVER MIND\"  He saw this very same object back in 1979 while with a group of friends. That sighting lasted for about 10 minutes as a triangular-shaped object moved slowly in their field of vision from right to left.  I must say that these encounters are similar in that there is an eerie calm and that sometimes no-one seems to be around or is arousable when these experiences happen--obviously \"they\" set it up this way.",

Good afternoon, June 16th, my mother called me quickly to come see something strange in the sky.  She quoted seeing antennas on some craft.

I believe I also saw some form of sphere in the middle.  I really hope they can share my photo on the web. As it passed above us,  below the clouds, nice sunny day.  I took out my phone and happen to take a one second video! I have an image of what we saw.  I'm excited and share the photo with my close relatives to tell me, what I saw.

They were a few different things happening as we were looking at that direction.  We could spot more than one object.  I took a couple of videos hoping that at least one would capture the right image.  In the video that I play repeatedly, you can also clearly see how something shoots out of the bigger object.  The object appears and disappears.  When they appear again it was slightly a different area.  Not the same spot.  At some point, it moved above us.  Extremely high in the sky I would not even be able to calculate ! how far up it was.  I do know it was above us because that\u2019s where it stopped and then left.

I was in Minneapolis in July 1998 visiting my cousins with my parents. They live in suburbs of Minneapolis.  One night around 1am i couldn't sleep because i was too hot, being from Scotland im not used to the heat! I got up to open a window but the problem was there was a mesh on the inside to stop mosquitos. I coludn't work out how to open it so was at the window for quite some time. It was then that i noticed a light in the corner of my eye. Looking out the window across the suburbs i could see a disk shaped craft hovering above a small clump of trees in the middle of the suburbs. It was about 500 yards away. It was clear to see because the house i was in was on a hill and the suburbs sloped away from it so there was nothing obstructing my view. I was almost looking slightly down on the craft. The craft was dark in colour, about 100 feet wide and thin from top to bottom, maybe only 10 or 15 feet. There were also small lights in the middle of the craft around its circumfrance. There was a green beam of light shinning from the middle of the underside of the craft down into the trees below. It was about 15-20 feet wide and panned out fractionaly futher from the craft. I watched it for about 10seconds or so then the light shut off. Without any noise the craft disappeared in a streak of orange light leading up to the right into the night sky. It was as if it had almost instantly accelerated to a speed hundreds of times faster than any plane, simply too fast to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD))",

It was very high and appeared to be circular or possibly a cylinder shape.  We were facing east and the sun was behind us. It was still daylight with a clear blue sky. The object appeared to be reflecting the sun as its light varied as it moved in its circular path. It seemed that at certain points in the circle it was at a better angle for reflecting the sun. It was making circles and moving north, then it faded away for a while or moved too far away to see, then it returned and circled around some more.  At the time airplanes were landing in a path from Lake Harriet, southeast toward the airport. The planes were crossing under the area where these objects appeared to be circling, so they were very high up.  After about 10 minutes, we saw two identical lights circling in the same pattern in unison, again moving northward, then fading away, then returning to the same spot due east. We watched until they faded away again then went inside. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

We were going about our business as usual on the blacktop hill at the school across the street from my house. The weather was perfect.  At any rate, I saw ((name deleted)) eyes get real wide as he looked at the sky. I looked up and what I saw was amazing. I saw what appeared to be a triangular shaped craft of some kind. I can clearly recall that the bottom was bordered with a green glowing light, and there was a large circular orange light right in the middle of the bottom of the craft. So basically, I was looking a a big green-rimmed triangle with a circular orange light in the center.  When I first looked at it it seemed like it was quite far away. Like it was  just passing overhead. But to my mixed horrer/awe/excitement as soon as I looked at the damned thing it slowly but surely started coming right at me. It felt as though I were attached to it by some kind of string, and that by looking at it I was pulling it towards me. Like we were magnetically attracted and we had reached the point of no return, and a collision was inevitable. I also had this odd feeling that everything but me and the object had ceased to exist. I mean, everything was still around me, but it was like everything but me and the ship was on pause or something.  As it descended towards me I watched in awe as it just kept coming closer, and closer, and closer. And the closer it came, the bigger I realized it was. Eventually the thing got so low that I thought it would squash me along with 3/4 of my city block. It was truly amazing. It was gigantic, and it came down right over me in the middle of North Minneapolis! I would have expected chaos around me if I had been thinking clearly. I mean, cars should have been pulled over honking, people should have been yelling, etc... But no. Complete calm. And the calm seemed perfectly natural to me.  So, when the ship had come so low that i could hit it with a baseball it was like I snapped out of a trance and panic overwhelmed me. I immediately burst towards my front door across the street. Upon my first step was the first time my brother and my friend had entered my awareness since I first spotted the object.  I don't actually remember physically running across the street, but that may have been due to pure panic. Anyway, I got to the door with my brother and friend scrambling right behind me. I took one last look up as I darted into the house, and there was nothing there.  An odd side note. My brother only remembers seeing the thing from a very far distance. He remembers a big ass light far up in the sky and that's about it. ((name deleted)) remembers the thing descending, but he doesn't remember it getting nearly as close as I do.

      "story": "Two spheres flying in tight formation near Ford Parkway bridge On June 16th 2006, my wife and I were sitting outdoors at a caf\u00e9, the clouds looked particularly interesting that day, and as I often photograph them for my projects, I asked her if she minded us making a quick stop at the Ford Parkway bridge. This bridge provides an excellent panoramic view of the sky, perfect for capturing images of clouds.  I considered stopping at home first, to grab my Nikon D50, but I could tell I was testing my wife\u2019s patience as it was. To my everlasting regret, we proceeded with my cheap digital camera that I kept in my car.  We got to the bridge and I walked out to the center of the bridge and took about 20 some pictures. The sky was partly cloudy (25% cloud cover?) but mostly blue sky.  When I finished, I walked back to the other end of the bridge where my wife stood waiting. As I talked to her I noticed two grey spheres flying toward us from the East in tight formation, the one nearest us just above the other.  They flew at a constant speed and trajectory from East to West. I was so excited I forgot that I had a camera in my hand. I kept asking if my wife could see them, but she could not. By the time I finally got my composure, the objects had begun to pass behind an apartment complex in front of us. Unfortunately the next mistake I made was to switch my camera to the movie setting, not realizing that the resolution is so poor it would not pick up the objects. I took a short video which is completely useless.  I have seen many different aircraft in my 43 years on this planet, these objects defy conventional classification. They were not weather balloons, I have seen weather balloons. They were perfect spheres, metallic gray, but not too reflective.  I figured that the reason my wife did not see then was the glare. Despite the partial cloud cover that day, it was actually a very bright day, and I had polarized prescription shades on. As the objects passed through the sky the seemed light gray, as they passed in front of clouds they seemed darker. They disappeared on the Eastern horizon. From the time I spotted them to the time they reached the Eastern horizon was less then a minute.",

While driving home from Salina, KS my radio went completely static for a about a minute (I tried several channels) and moments later I saw lights to my left (which was west) and I looked out my window and saw a craft that was triangular shaped. It had brighter white lights on each point and dimmer lights at the midpoint of each side.  It was very low to the ground, lower than any normal plane would be traveling and it made absolutely no sound. It was traveling south pretty slowly; I took my eyes off of it to look back at the road to check my driving when I looked back it had disappeared.

      "story": "Glowing green object crosses Twin Cities at low altitude I was driving home alone on westbound highway 36 in Roseville MN.  It was about 10:45 pm and I had just passed the Rosedale shopping mall when I glanced out the side window of my car.  I saw a craft emitting pale green light moving very quickly through the low clouds.  It was flying from east to west, toward downtown Minneapolis.  I watched it glide through the sky for a moment, but then I had to look back at the road to make a curve.  When I tried again to look for the light, it was gone.  Because of the low clouds, I could not fully make out what the object was.  At first I thought it was a small plane, but it instantly struck me as different because it did not behave like a plane.  Its pale green light was steady, not blinking.  And it was moving at a low altitude so quickly and steadily, in an impossibly-perfect straight line.  I have never seen any plane do like this.  And about 30 seconds after I saw this, my 17 year old nephew called me from St Paul MN on my cellular phone to tell me that he had just seen a UFO.  He described exactly what I had just seen--only he had gotten a better look at it.  He was sitting outside on his front step in St Paul, and the craft crossed the sky at low altitude, from east to west.  He saw the same pale green light passing in and out of the low clouds.  But he got a good look at the craft -- it was triangular shaped, like an arrowhead.  And the pale green light was coming from lights along the edges that were long, more like fluorescent light tubes than like bulbs that you would see on a plane.  And the craft was perfectly silent.  I believe my nephew and I saw the same craft, from vantage points about 10 miles apart, as it crossed the Twin Cities from St Paul to Minneapolis at low altitude.

      "story": "UFO - Viewed From Downtown Minneapolis, MN Observation location:  Across the street from Orchestra Hall, 1210 Marquette Ave., Minneapolis, MN, looking down Marquette Ave. toward the Wells Fargo and IDS Towers. Description:  Object was a light, appearing from this vantage point to be above the Wells Fargo Tower.  The taller IDS Tower is located to the left of the Wells Fargo Tower, the object would typically move slowly from the right of the Wells Tower, left above the top of the Wells Tower, and continue further to the IDS Tower, and would go out of view behind the IDS Tower.  The object would come from behind the IDS Tower back over the Wells Tower, then move to the right beyond the Wells Tower, and back again. The object sometimes performed fast complete loops in the air, would abruptly stop, and would drift slowly once again.  Sometimes the object would change direction abruptly moving up, down, sideways, or diagonally at a high rate of speed, sometimes instantaneously changing direction at a high rate of speed several times before abruptly stopping and then beginning to drift again.  There were times when the object would appear to hover without moving for up to a minute.  On at least two occasions the object quickly, at a high rate of speed, darted down at a diagonal between the towers toward the ground, covering two thirds the height of the Wells Tower in perhaps one half second.  There were times when the object would go dark and reappear several seconds later, sometimes at the same, sometimes at a different location.  There were times when the object would become dim, then brighter.  There were times when the object would appear to pulsate in intensity.  The second witness, ! a woman who stopped to watch, stated that the object changed colors. Luminosity:  Variable, from dark to dim, but often about as bright as Jupiter would appear in a dark sky.  Note that downtown Minneapolis is highly lit at night, as is the Wells Tower itself. Other:  The aircraft obstruction light on the antenna mast at the top of the IDS Tower functioned normally during the entire observation.  Several large commercial aircraft, apparently on approach to MSP International, made typical runs across the general area appearing to be at a higher elevation than the object observed.  There was an advertising searchlight scanning the sky in Minneapolis that night but it had no effect upon the observation of this object.  I observed the light for twenty five minutes, left and returned twenty minutes later to find the object still presenting itself as before.  I left and returned once again thirty minutes after the second observation and could observe no trace of the object. Opinion:  This was not a conventional aircraft, helicopter, or bird.  The abrupt stops, instantaneous change of direction, zig-zagging, and fast rates of speed, loops, and abrupt stops are inconsistent with such explanations.

      "story": "Large trinagular craft spotted over Mpls, MN in 1975 In either late '75 or early (jan-mar) '76 my husband and I were driving through a neighborhood known as North Minneapolis. I was in the passenger seat.  My husband suddenly hit the brakes and exclaimed \"What the hell is that?\".  He had stopped where a large elm tree blocked my view and he moved forward.  When he did I looked to my left and saw about 100 feet above the houses, a large triangular craft.  it was moving in parallel to us but in the opposite direction.  While I kept the craft in view my husband went the short distance to the end of the block and turned the corner to follow it.  I do not recall any lights, the craft was a medium gray and from what I could perceive the only way we were able to see it at all was that it was so close to the ground the street lights were illumination the bottom.  I looked specifically for any openings for landing gear etc but the bottom was smooth.  It was winter so the windows were rolled up and the heater was on so I dont know that it made any sound.  As we followed it down the block it appeared to be moving at no more than 10 miles and hour.  I looked to see if lights were going on and if people were coming out of their homes but did not see any unusual activity.  We did turn another corner to keep it in sight and that is when I saw what I call an army jeep with a young blond bespectacled male soldier standing outside the jeep with one hand on the steering wheel, the other on the door and one foot just on the inside of the car.  He was also staring at the craft. As we passed him I looked at his face but he did not seem to notice us.  I observed that the craft was accelerating and told my husband to drive faster. With a sudden burst of speed the craft was gone.  I dont know if it moved away from any light source and so became impossible to see but it did seem to me that it simply vanished.  We tried to continue in the direction in which the craft was headed and came to a point where we could see a bridge crossing the Mississippi.  I felt that if any! one on t he bridge was seeing it that traffic would come to a halt but this did not happen.  He is now my ex-husband and about 25 years after this happened I asked him if he remembered what we saw.  He remembers that the craft had lights and that there was more than one military vehicle at the scene.  I know that people use football fields as a measure but I am not familiar with the size of football fields so I can only tell you that it measured the length of three small single family homes driveways included.  I did not report it to the police as my then husband feared ridicule but I have always been curious as to whether others saw the same thing that night.  I have run into many people who did not strike me as mentally stable who are involved in such organizations as MUFON and so when I say you on a news program I thought perhaps you were the person to report this too.

It was very distant, but if I were to hold up something to compare it to, it would have been about the size of a dime from my perspective.

I turned to my friend to ask him, \"What is that?\" and when I turned back to the sky one second later to point at it, the object was gone.  Completely disappeared, and I had a wide view of the sky.

I regularly watch the skies for moving lights and can tell the difference between satellites and other objects.  Over the last year,  early in the morning  when the skies are clear I have witnessed individual lights moving in a pattern inconsistent with any satellites; usually diagonal across the sky instead of North to South or East to West.  Some of the objects are brighter than any stars and do not blink. Some blink very brightly without a consistent pattern.  What is most puzzling is that I have followed these objects across the sky and then suddenly there is an intense flash and it disappears.

It was a sunny afternoon and I took some pics of the sun behind a large tree and a commercial jet making a contrail next to tree (visually speaking). I did not notice several small shapes to the right as I was focused on the tree when taking the pictures. My camera is an iPhone 5s. I can send you the picture setting details if that helps.  So, I took two photos where the objects appear. They were taken 3 seconds apart, but, the objects have changed shape and are apparently further away and in a different area of the sky (you can see this in the two photos). I have enlarged these images and looked at them from different angles and experimented with changing the contrast and sharpness of the pics. You can judge for yourself but so far I have not been able to debunk them as balloons or Chinese lanterns or conventional aircraft. To me the second picture has even more oddness to it in several respects.

I was on the rooftop bar of The Solara, a resturant in downtown Minneapolis, MN, with my entire family one evening.  We were sitting at a round table, I was facing out toward the city, and I could see most of the towers in the city.  I was visiting with my family and looking out at the buildings, when I saw a yellow/gold object kind of glide out from behind the tower I was looking at. The way it moved almost looked like it was floating on water or something as it came in and out of view from behind this skyscraper.  Just really smooth hovering, gliding, deliberate motion.  It was coming out from the left side of the building and going back behind it.  It never crossed to the other visible side of the building kept coming out the left side.  It did this over and over for a minute. The distance was a mile away I would guess.  It did not look very large.  This object did this for a couple minutes until another object came into view.  Almost looked like it appeared, or went from very small to visible, or like it came from far away into view to look just like the first one my family and I have been watching now for a few  minutes. Remind you, this rooftop was completely full, but I didn\u2019t see anyone else looking at it, but we were.  The two objects stayed for another 30 seconds or so, kind of hovered around a bit until a 3rd object came down, almost like it was telling the other 2 to come back. I saw all three there for about 8 seconds, the third a bit smaller because it was further away, until all three took off.  When they took off they got smaller and smaller like they flew away very, very quickly.  They didn\u2019t just disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

We sat down and we were having a conversation when he told me to check out the ring of light off to the south. I looked over and saw what he was talking about.  At first I thought that some business must be projecting lights into the sky to draw attention. When I said that to him, he said, \u201cJust look at it.  If it was a business projecting that light, wouldn\u2019t you be able to see the beams coming from below?\u201d   I sat there for a moment and watched this ring. I looked over at my boyfriend and asked him if he thought that the ring seemed to be moving closer to us.  He agreed with me.  As we sat and watched this ring, I noticed that it seemed to be illuminating from inside the ring.  I went in and got my phone so I could take a photo and hope to capture the light.  I came back out and started to take photos.  Unfortunately, the photos do not show the enormity and brightness of this ring.   I live close to an airport, and was able to take a photo of a plane flying near this illuminating ring.  The longer I sat and looked at the ring, the more I convinced myself that there had to be a logical explanation for it.

      "story": "Source of halo of lights seen over Minneapolis Area ((NUFORC Note:  We agree.  The lights probably were from the casino.  PD)) I am submitting this in response to the report about the halo of lights seen by multiple people in the Minneapolis area on or around the date of August 9, 2015.  I heard about the sightings last night (8/13/15) on Coast to Coast AM, and, since I live in the Twin Cities area, I was of course very interested in these sightings and went to your site to view the photos and read the reports. Upon viewing the pictures, I could not figure out what the lights might be from, nor could my husband.  We were both very intrigued. Later today, however, as luck would have it, I was perusing various Facebook pages dedicated to another (local) interest of mine, namely the musical artist, Prince.  When I saw the photos on your site of the halo of lights, it didn't jog my memory about a particular photo that was posted to Prince's band's official Twitter on that same night of the other reports of the halo:  August 9, 2015.  But one of the Facebooks I saw today had posted the photo and well...I think I have an answer for you as to the source of that halo of lights. Here is the link to the Tweet and photo posted to Prince's official Twitter: https://twitter.com/Prince3EG/status/630615331308830720?s=04    As I read through the comments, I saw that many people said the halo of lights was from an illuminated teepee display at a nearby casino, Mystic Lake Casino.  Paisley Park Studios, Mystic Lake Casino and the area the other reports came from (if I heard correctly last night on the radio) are all relatively near proximity and also if it was an overcast night, the lights would likely be seen a distance away as well (I'd think, anyway). A quick bit of research by my husband, using Google Earth and Google Images, shows that, in my opinion, the comments about the halo of lights coming from that teepee are likely correct.  I will email images for your convenience, but if you would like also to check for yourself as well, merely put search terms \"Mystic Lake Casino\" into Google Images and it will pull up these same pictures, and more. I hope I have helped.  I enjoy your reports on Coast to Coast AM very much.",

I was able to watch it for about 2-3 minutes before it became obscured by trees. I rode on approaching the west side of the I-35 overpass, and came to a high, open spot giving me the opportunity to see the ball of pulsating light again. It hadn\u2019t moved, changed size, or direction in the 3-5 minutes since I had seen it last.

      "story": "Light formation in sky and similar pattern reflected on people in photos taken an hour earlier. Seven of us were hanging out on our rooftop deck and I pointed out two lights above us behind the fast moving clouds.  We couldn\u2019t tell if the lights were moving slowing for about 5 minutes and then stopped, or was stationary the entire time.  For about 20 minutes the lights remained still as we watched them dim and brighten behind the moving clouds.  We could see a faint third light which created a triangular formation.  However, the photos suggest there may have been more lights than what we could see by eye. Heavier clouds rolled through and, once cleared, the lights were gone. About 20 minutes after the light formation disappeared, we saw a very bright aircraft fly overhead.  We all agreed it was an airplane, yet it did appear to be much brighter, faster and and closer than what we typically see in the area.  Our condo is directly under a flight path and we also acknowledged that no airplanes had been seen since we first noticed the lights. Then this morning (the next day), I was reviewing our photos from the evening and noticed a single green formation on my friend\u2019s left shoulder.  It appears on the chest of the person sitting next to him in a different photo. Attached are photos of the formation we saw in the sky and a zoomed in photo of the pattern on my friend. 20:04 Photos of friends 21:30 Noticed two lights in the sky 21:41 Photos of lights. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness provides a number of high-quality photographs.  The green objects, seen against the arm and shoulder of one of the people present, suggests to us that there is a flaw in the camera.  The other lights appear to us to be reflected from the bottoms of clouds, which suggests advertising lights, although we cannot be certain.  PD))",

So, it was 3 pm when my mother went to sit outside and noticed something move far into the sky.  The ufo seen was not any particular shape, but I can describe as round.  Like a light red sort of pinkish.  No lights or anything shiny...  They were about 5 or 6, maybe more of these round things that were visible, then invisible.  Nothing metallic, like in the movies.  \"They\" were hovering over the city as we could see.   As hours went by, they were hovering closer and closer on top of where we were.  They had a peaceful movement as they appeared and again disappeared.  Constantly moving.  I was AMAZED, for nothing, absolutely nothing could describe fully what we saw.  We stared up into the sky for hours!!!   A few people gathered at the place where we were to see.  Neighbors, friends and family.  We tried to take a video but the objects could not be seen as with our eyes.   We were not scared but more so AMAZED.  We pretty much stared until our necks hurt!

It hovered for a couple seconds then it went in a straight line real fast back in the direction where it came. It lasted about a minute and I don't know if anyone else saw it, for I was alone.
