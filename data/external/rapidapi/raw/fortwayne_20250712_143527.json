      "story": "Stationary Sphere Viewed Off Tip of Crescent Moon Not Far From Ft. Wayne, Indiana I was returning from visiting my son in Ft. Wayne, Indiana and while driving down Hwy 33 heading towards St Rd 6 traveling NW towards Elkhart, Indiana area, I witnessed what I now believe to be an Orb or Sphere shaped object.  I was in the country area just about 50 miles NW of Ft. Wayne and I happened to look up at the cresent moon which was to the left of my drivers window.  What caught my eye was that just off the tip of the cresent moon, there was an object which reminded me of a drop of water haning off the tip of the moon.  I starred for a while and determined that it was definitely not a star.  I could see that it had a circular shape and reflected the sun light as did the moon. I continued to see the object (which never moved from its \"hanging off the tip of the moon position\".  And eventually the road turned and I stopped paying attention.   But when I got home, I was so baffled by what I had seen, that I called the local weather station and asked about possible satelites in the area, but was told there werent any that i could see or anything that would be there like I described.  I have recently seen videos and pictures of what I can now saw if very much like what I thought i saw that night.  And due to the fact that these spheres have been documented as moving and being still, i do believe that is what i saw that night.   All I know for sure is that it was NOT A STAR!   And it was not there later on in the night.  Since it was a routine journey, it did not have a camera on hand unfortunately.

She lives in an area where there is not much light pollution. There is some from a near by gas station and some street lights and a liquor store and houses that would emit light.  I walked out first and she was still up stairs locking the door.  I\u2019m an observant person and always look up at the sky to see what stars are out.  I waited at the steps for her to grab her things and lock the door.  We began to walk to her car and I was still looking up and was going to comment on how it would be a good night for telescopes. When I looked up, there were five disc shaped objects flying in a perfect diagonal line heading north east.  I was scared at first and extremely uneasy. The car wanst unlocked yet and she noticed me acting out of sorts and I remember saying, \"look, look, look up!!!\"  I was frantic. I ran around the car and grabbed her head and pointed her eyes to the sky where they should have been, but there was nothing. They had disappeared. After the sighting I became tremendously nervous about what I have seen.  I have always wished to see a U.F.O. and now, I wished I haven\u2019t. There were five of them in a perfect diagonal line flying north east. There was no sound and no lights. I believe they were pretty close in proximity to the ground.  They moved very gracefully in formation, they had to have been at least 20-25 feet apart from each other.  I know as well as anyone that balloons do not fly in such a tight pattern. The only way these objects were visible is due to the very low lights in the area; it seemed like five soft balls flying together.  I don\u2019t know any other way to describe them.  I have called the local authorities to tell them about this sighting. I have always believed in U.F.O.s and now I wish I have never seen these tonight.  I am honestly scared and excited at the same time.  I dunno. I wish to get in contact with people that share the same. I am a smart person and I know that these objects were not of anything made by man.  I wish I have never saw them.  I would rather wonder than to know now. ((Name deleted))",

Wayne IN  I travel the same route at the same time everyday and have for the last 7 years.  Have never seen anything out of the ordinary until this morning.  I always watch the stars and know the constellations, as they are the same everyday.  This morning I noticed a blue-white light in the sky, similar to an LED type light.  This light did not appear to move in any direction and was not a star, planet, helicopter or airplane.  I noticed that the stars that should have been in that part of the sky were no longer visible because something was blocking them out.   As I approached Ft. Wayne, the light appeared brighter but still wasn\u2019t moving.  I pulled over to the side of the road and came to a complete stop.  When I got out of my truck to observe the object in the sky, it blended in nearly perfectly with the night sky but was one or two shades darker.  The blue-white light was near the rear of the craft on the belly.  The light was round in shape with conical shaped protrusion coming off the bottom.  The light was bright but you could see through it enough to identify the structure emitting the light.  The light was not in the shape of a beam or floodlight but rather was more iridescent.  All the edges of the craft distorted the night sky similar to the heat you see shimmering off of a hot blacktop road surface.  The object was triangular in shape but turned on its side, resembling a wedge, with the point facing northwest.  It was moving at an extremely slow rate.  There was no sound.  There were no other distinguishing features to describe. I had to continue on my way turning northwest with the object; it remained constant in the sky until I headed south and lost site of it. I called 911 in Ft. Wayne (Allen Co.) and reported the object and was told that there had been several other reports of the same thing.  The dispatcher that took my information was very dismissive. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  However, we believe that this report was submitted by the gentleman with whom we spoke via telephone.

The window has a csoutherly view and I can easily see the zodiak and I like to check the sky condition and watch the planets traverse across my view.  The sky last night was a broken layer of this stratocumulus ans, as usual, the city haize cast an eirie glow on the clouds. Then I seen what I thought was an aircraft loosing aititude in preparation for the final landing approach to the city's larger passenger airport or so I thought.  But the aircraft did not look normal, first of all the city haise illuminated the object as it slowly moved acrost my view. It had a, sort of, saucer appearance, a scetch will be sent in conjunction to this report.  The object appeared a grey color similiar to how the clouds looked. I seen what looked like three round windows on the \"side.\" I will estimate the angular height of about two and a half clemched fists, at arms length, and the widest portion of the object was from a half to one full thumbs width.  Next I seen no navigation lights or landing lights which I normally see on aircraft of any size at night. I watch the object for a few minutes and resumed my business as I pordered what I saw. It was then that I decided that what I seen was no airplane but instead it was an artifact that was made here on earth or somewhere else in the cosmos by an intelligence that we cnnot comprehend althought we try.  I have been an amateur astronomer for about sixty years now and I typically see lights in the sky that I cannot explain using out technology so I basically ignore them but this time I got a physical outline to study.

Our family was late night fishing at a lake near the military installation.  The lake was in a secluded wooded area.  The approximate time was 11:30 p.m. I recall that it was a clear and cool night.  The object first appeared in the distance flying military crest along the mountains.  We could only see the lights which were approximately 5-8 miles away.  My father, an aircraft mechanic for the Army, was not sure of the object.  He stated that it was moving too fast for a helicopter and flying much too low and fast to be a prop aircraft.  We ignored it after that it wasn\u2019t until 15 minutes later the object was hovering near us at the lake.  It was approximately 100 ft from our location, in the open observing us.  We remained motionless and stared at the craft during the entire duration.  The object was hovering 50 ft off the ground.  It was a disc shaped objec! t about 75 ft in diameter, with domes above and below the main hull.  Lights of various colors flashed around the domes.  The craft was silent and remained hovering for 10 mins before lifting off slowly, heading away from our location then accelerated quickly out of sight.  I will never forget this night.",

      "story": "Multiple sightings of fast moving points of light with changing motion, no identifiable shape, sudden appearances and disappearances. Multiple sightings of unidentified objects have occurred in the past few weeks over Fort Wayne, Indiana. Sightings have been made by myself and 5 other people.  I have experience in astronomy, astrology, and physics, as do two other witnesses.  REPORT:  On clear nights the unknown objects have been seen flying across the sky as (apparently) tiny points of light--NOT BLINKING, with a constant glow--, about the size/brightness of an average star (from our perspective). At first we assumed they were planes or possibly satellites, but for how small they were--seeing as they were at extremely high altitudes--they were moving far too fast.  The objects moved at a seemingly constant velocity, but their independent trajectories are  not constant.  We have seen them travel in straight paths, in exaggerated arcs, and even move back in forth in a kind of weaving motion. What is peculiar is that the objects do not appear off the horizon, they simply appear at random points in the sky, sometimes along with barely noticeable flashes of light.  Some are stationary and then begin to move very suddenly with no detectable acceleration.  Furthermore, the objects do not necessarily fly toward the horizon as they move away from us.  Instead they either fade away or simply blip out of sight.  We assume that this means they are not following the curve of the earth, but moving on some kind of tangent.  One object was the most interesting.  It was much lower in the atmosphere then the others, appearing very large and bright, but with no obvious shape.  It was just a point of light.  It moved very quickly across the sky, and disappeared in a very sudden and almost undetectable flash of light.  It was nowhere near the horizon at the time of its disappearance.  The color of light coming from the larger object seemed to be a yellow shade, the wavelength being around 580nm. The most recent sighting was witnessed by myself alone at approximately 4:15 am, Wednesday, July 15 2009.  There was a small flash and then a poi! nt of li ght like others before.  This time, though,as the object moved directly over my position, the amplitude of the light it emitted greatly increased until it was very very bright.  It dimmed again, then brightened for a shorter amount of time, before quickly speeding up and simply disappearing at about 75 degrees off the horizon. ** I realize this report is not very well organized, but it is in all aspects completely serious.  I would very sincerely appreciate if someone were to look into this case. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

When we looked at what she was talking about at first we thought it was an airplane and then realized it wasn\u2019t so we pull over into a parking lot.  When we were watching this craft is was circular and had different lights flashing from it.  The colors were red, blue, green and white.  It also had an aura around it.  We watch it for about an hour.  It just kept on floating from left to right and up and down.  Also coming closer to us then fading back away.  Then all of a sudden my husband decided to look directly up to see if there was anything else in the sky.  We saw these small circular objects moving so fast through the sky, moving left to right and diagonally.  One of the objects went directly towards an airplane it looked like it was going to hit it.  We think the first craft we saw might have been commutating with the little crafts.  During this sighting my husband had called his mother and his brother to tell them to look in the sky toward the east to see if they can see what we were seeing.   After a few minutes his brother saw it and then so did his mother.  His brother also saw the little crafts going toward the airplane and zipping back and forth in the sky.  We were all amazed at what we were seeing, it was very weird.  This was my first sighting of a UFO, this was my husband\u2019s second sighting.  It all seem too weird to be true but it was since his family seen it too and they were on the other side of the town.  Well needless to say that it was our daughters\u2019 first UFO sighting, she was really scared and kept her eyes closed and said can we just get to the store already.

It was a pretty chilly and breezy fall Sunday night but we wanted to look at the stars since we had just moved recently and were excited to view the night sky since it was so clear out.  Within just a few minutes an unusual traveling bright circular bluish white light caught our attention at an instant.  At first I thought it was a shooting star, but then it appeared to be moving closer towards us and not disappearing we knew such to be.  We watched it travel closer towards us for about a minute staring in amazement, disbelief and even a little fear that it may be an asteroid or bomb. We watched it get closer and brighter for about 30 seconds, moving further east then remain quite stationary for about 3 seconds when it was at its brightest before vanishing into the eastern night sky at a rapid but steady gliding speed for about 6 seconds until it totally disappeared.  It seemed to have come into our atmosphere from space, descend and then leave a different direction. I noticed an orbiting satellite and airplanes in flight and compared how different the light and motion of travel was in every way just to rule out things from our planet that travel regularly.  We had cancelled out everything and both believed we had encountered an UFO. I was convinced within 5 seconds that it could possibly be an UFO because of a prior experience.  While walking my dog a few years ago with my husband I noticed a black triangular object in the sky just before dusk thinking it was a bird at first until it just kept descending and appearing more like the size of a helicopter. and then within a few blinks of an eye went back up into the sky faster than I\u2019ve ever seen anything move that distance.  What I saw in both experiences are almost exactly the same as far as the flight pattern and vanishing so fast.",

The sky was full with bright stars and no clouds were seen during this time.  I noticed a triangular formation of four bright orange lights traveling from the North to the South of the Fort Wayne Area.  Then we noticed one single orange light actually leading the formation and then two following the formation from the rear.  The lights appeared to be moving at a continuas speed with the four in the triangular formation staying in a perfect formation.  The first ofject, after watching all of them travel past us with absolutly no noise, faded out and was never seen again.  The four in the formation then began to fade out in the same area as the one.  The two from the rear also faded out at what appeared to the be the same area of the sky that the previous five disappeared!

They appeared stationery; but they appeared to be moving at high speeds, while some moved slowly, stopped, changed direction, then moved off in a westward direction.  I noticed there were planes in the sky that night, because I could see their running lights.  These lights were a solid, with no flashing lights. I snapped a photo with my digital camera, which appeared to catch nothing but blackness.  I also attempted to capture video, but it, too, displayed only blackness, with no sight of anything.

There were four of us this evening star gazing around a small camp fire.  We spotted objects in the air flying out of the east horizon.  They moved strongly west (slightly southwest) at speeds consistent with incredibly fast/low flying fighter jets which we have at our local air base in Fort Wayne, IN.  They flew almost directly above us but slightly to the south of our vantage point.   There were objects (at least three dozen or so) which appeared to be circular in nature but more oval shaped (similar to the body of a jellyfish).  There were no sounds at all or any beacon type lighting.  They blended in with the sky very well but seemed illuminated by the ground lights of the city/suburbs near us.   The moon was not visible to us for any comparison but they were much bigger than any stars (about the size of a quarter or fifty cent piece hel! d at arms-distance).  When we first noticed them, they came in \u201csquadrons\u201d of about three in a seeming v-type formation.   There were several of these and were followed last by a very large clustering with no definite formation other than being in a large group.  They were all flying at speeds consistent with each other and very close together, not breaking from their location in relation to their set patterns and the other objects.   They seemed to be headed for a specific location and quickly.  It is a cloudless, very calm evening with virtually no distinct wind at ground level.  Our ground elevation is 826\u2019.",

They were all a brilliant white and were traveling east to west at different altitudes.  Their speed seemed to be around twice that of the passenger jets that I see frequently flying east to west or vice versa.  Some of these objects were below the clouds some were in the clouds and some were at very high altitude.  I heard no sound associated with this phenomena.  The sighting lasted approximately 20 to 25 minutes as I counted in excess of 50 objects flying by at different speeds and altitudes.  The objects seemed to pulsate bright white. There were no navigation lights on these objects.  There were also airplanes in the area that were significantly dimmer and flashing colored navigation lights.  On several occasions I saw objects change direction and or stop in-flight to avoid flying aircraft.  In fact I saw two objects change direction at 90\u00b0 angles instantaneously to avoid aircraft, then continue their Westerly progress. I have been an amateur astronomer most of my life.  Consequently I know an airplane when I see it. These were not airplanes.  I have always been a skeptic of these kinds of phenomena.  I am 55 years old and can honestly say I have never ever seen anything like this in my lifetime. I attempted taking video with my I-phone and photographs with my digital camera (which has a zoom lens).  The video did not turn out, however I do have a couple of photographs with stationary stars in the background and an image of one of the objects as a white streak.  If you request I would be happy to forward these to you.",

I hesitate to offer an estimation as i have no real source for my comparison except everyday life. to me it looked  the size of a jetliner maybe 1-5000 feet up.  a comparison for me would be a jetliner taking off and being maybe 30-45second into flight. not that ive seen that exact scenario, but that is the estimation i can give. It looked huge, i could see the edges, i could make the outline, but it appeared as though it was shrouded by clouds. it could be that the craft was huge and flying in the clouds, but there is no way any craft ive seen would look that big being up in the clouds. if this craft was up in the clouds, i couldnt even give you an estimate as to size. i have no comparison, simple as that. if the craft were closer to ground, the size would seem more plausible,barely.  still the shape and silence of the craft wouldn't. but none the less, closer to the ground brings the issue of why was it shrouded by clouds. i wont deny that i have had a fascination with UFOs, airplanes, spacecraft, science in general. which makes this experience even more shaking. I frequent nasa's page, i play computer games where you build aircraft, ive always had a passion for aviation. i COULD NOT explain what i was looking at. even while i was looking at it, trying to think of possible critiques and explanations.",

As I turned around to get into the car, I saw three bright orange lights in a \u201cV\u201d formation and a fourth \u201cstraggler\u201d slightly behind, moving slowly across the sky from the SW toward the NE.   My husband was already in the car and I told him to get out and take a look.  We both were watching the 4 lights, which seemed to disappear behind the thick cloud cover, but as we again turned to get into the car, there was another group of 4 orange lights, the first 3 in V-formation.  This time the 4th one was much further behind, but they all were traveling SW to NE.   Because our intention tonight was to get the grocery shopping done, we drove over to Meijer.  As we parked the car in the Meijer lot, we could still the 4th \u201cstraggler\u201d of the second group of orange lights and we stood in the parking lot watching until the light seemed to fade behind the clouds.   My husband dismissed these orange lights as most likely \u201cmilitary.\u201d  But they were not your typical air plane lights.  They were orange, with a slight yellow waver and were steady with no blinking.  The speed at which they traveled was slower than a plane, but made me think of a glider.  As far as I could tell, they made no sound.  All I could hear was highway traffic and shopping center traffic.   We saw these unusual lights flying in this formation above a busy outdoor shopping mall, with people coming and going from the theater and restaurants.  I was looking around for someone else to look up or someone close enough that we could talk to and ask if they could see these lights too, but the people we saw were too far away and/or on their cell phones!  What were these lights?  Weather balloons?  Drones?  A group of eight people flying gliders at night?   My husband and I both have Bachelor degrees, he in Computer Science and I in Liberal Arts (English Literature).  I'm always looking at the sky and am knowledgable about the planets and stars, thanks to Stardate.org.",

Today, the field that I was looking at has become an addition.  There is a large water tower that abuts the addition I live in.  Off in the distance, beyond the water tower, were over five glowing balls of light in the sky.  Airplanes usually pass over this area, as there is an airport that is off to one direction, but these did not behave like aircraft.  In fact, they moved constantly for about 15 minutes, weaving and ducking in the sky.  At one point, they almost made a triangular shape.  Then, in one instant, they moved away, so quickly, that it could not have been an airplane.  It was like a rocket, and they all took off at once, every single ball of light, as if it was coming from one craft. I didn't see any aircraft chasing the object, but I have been puzzled thinking about it ever since it had happened.  Usually, I'm not one to believe in this kind of stuff.  When I saw what I saw though, I instantly believed.  I have never seen anything like it before in my life.

Driving over the 469 overpass on highway 1, looking east past the catholic church and fields, was a blue light-  I told my son it was probably a new radio tower or something.   I slowed down and we kept an eye on it driving in my convertible- top down- full view- And I noticed it was a little higher up off the ground then I thought..  Suddenly this blue light that was stationary in one spot for a good minute or more just went from 0-1,000 mph shooting off southward and climbing north into the sky by about 30 degree incline..   So, given this was near our airport- I'm wondering if this is the reason why we constantly are seeing the Warthog jets flying circles overhead almost daily since then.  And I watched videos of military prototypes of flying disc and other experimental things and they cannot take off like that..  they go slow and hover and do more spy like missions.  They are not capable of shooting off that fast, and military stuff doesn't emit a bright blue light in the center.",

The object was visible for about 2 minutes.   The object was at least cloud level or above, as it either became slowly obscured by clouds or gradually diminished.  The speed during the observation was roughly that of a typical traffic helicopter, but the object was not a helicopter.  It made absolutely no sound. For comparison, moments afterwards, an airplane was observed moving in a southwesterly direction.  It was at a much higher altitude, loud, and easily identifiable through the spotty breaks in the cloud cover. The observers were a middle-aged husband and wife.

The next evening, I was outside with my fianc\u00e9e and we were out around the same time as I was the night before 8:30 and we both saw a light like I did before except moving from east to west.  We saw it for about four or five seconds then it disappeared.  We thought that was cool and said it was interesting and as we said that it reappered for like a second heading in the direction. The third night was the weirdest cause around the same time on the 27th I and my fianc\u00e9e were sitting and I asked her if I should ask Yahweh to send a ufo for us to observe and she said sure.  So I stretched my arms out and ask Yahweh to seen a ufo.  We sat there for five minutes and she went inside.  I stayed for a few more minutes and just as I was about to go inside I saw it in the corner of my eyes.  \tI turned to see a white flashing light blink several times so I yelled for my fianc\u00e9e to come back outside and she made it in time to see the light.
