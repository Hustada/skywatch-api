I was smoking outside of my house looking up the sky to check out the beautiful sky. I saw an (triangular) object with 3 dim lights travel at a rather high speed from east to west. I live rather close to the airport so I can tell what kind of normal airplane speed looks like up in the sky. What I saw was a high speed UFO with three dim lights travelling at a high speed without any audiable sound. I waited for at least for another 10 secs to see if sound can be heard. There was absolutely no sound. I couldn't really see the shape of the object because the it was dark but I certainly saw three dim lights with identical intensity.",

I know the fixed red light is on all airplanes, I worked in Navy aviation so that's normally the first thing that I would see on a plane that is flying at night. After another three or four seconds having not seen the light come back on, it did again but it only remained lit for maybe another half of a second. After the light disappeared the second time, I did not see it again. I have not ever seen an aircraft where the lights acted that way, so I felt very suspicious about it. There were no clouds in the! area where I was looking at, I was able to see all of the other stars around the light that I saw.

      "story": "Circular shaped, glowing object, hovering but moving slowly, then  traveling at a speed of at least thousands of mies per hourl In December, 1969, four of us--three 18 year old college  students and one professional, were traveling south on Interstate 75, returning home after a University of Kentucky basketball game.  South of Richmond, but north of Berea.  All four of us saw an object overhead, directly in front of us, with an apparant altitude of a few hundred feet.  The size cannot be estimated because the actual altitude could not be determined, as there were no clouds or hills, mountains, etc., behind the object..  The object was round, and glowing with a white color, giving an appearance similar to that of a floresent light, but round, i.e. a circle shape.  At that time, so far as I was aware, flouresent lights were only tube shaped, whether straight, or sometimes bent into a circle.  I am referring only to the type of light produced by the object.  The object had an apparant size larger than a full moon, and the brightness was similar to that of a full moon on a clear night.  It was definitely NOT, however, the moon.  The object was hovering, moving very slowly from east to west.  As we watched, the object suddenly accelerated to a speed far faster than it would seem would be possible within the laws of physics, and moved beyond the western horizon so quickly that it was virtually instantaneous.  At the point of the sighting, we were going down a long slope on the interstate, and the terrain was such that there was a very wide, unobstructed view toward the western horizon, of several miles.  \"Accelerted\" is actually not the correct word, because \"acceleration\" implies that the speed increased from a slow speed to a faster speed through a process of going faster and faster.  To the contrary, the object appeared to have NO TRANSITION from the slow east to west hover to a speed which covered miles from our location to the western horizon in, perhaps, a hundreth of a second.  The four of us agreed that we would not report the incident because of the ridicule that we would probably suffer.  About six years after the sighting, I saw a newspaper story in the Louisville Courier-Journal newspaper about a professor at Eastern Kentucky University, which is located in Richmond, who was gathering information about a large number of unexplained UFO sightings in the Richmond area over the previous several years.  The article pointed out that the US Army Bluegrass Depot, a storage area for nerve and other weapons grade gases, and perhaps other weapons, is located just south of Richmond.  I wrote to the professor, telling him about  the sighting in 1969, and offering to meet with him if he wished  He returned my correspondence, saying to contact him if I was in Richmond in the future, but did not seem anxious to hear the details of the sighting.  I never met with him.  All three of the observers who were students at the time are now professionals: an accountant, a pharmacist, and an attorney.

We, at first, thought it was a small aircraft, but it was very close to the ground. The light showed that it was very maneuverable in its sporadic, three-dimensional movements. Unique to this light, however, was a beam of a lighter white going from the main light (let\u2019s say craft) to the ground. The light could move independently from the movement of the craft itself, and it searched from the trees surrounding the field to about the middle of the field. The craft continued these actions for about 15 minutes until it traveled to the tree line. The movements then switched to only a line parallel to our side of the field on the opposite side above the trees. The light remained on the ground for 1 more minute until the craft got brighter (as if its beam were shining at us). I and my friends got the distinct feeling that it has seen us seeing it. Then, in the blink of an eye, it was gone. It did not go below the trees. It did not fly up to the sky. It simply disappeared.",

This sighting took place on Friday night September 28, 2001.   I might also add that one of the friends with me was an active FBI agent and also the driver of the vehicle. We were coming out of Richmond, Virginia at approximately 11:00 PM on the above date when we approached exit 58 on the southbound side of Interstate 95. On one side to the west is state route 150 with high tension electrical lines on the east running parallel to I-95 and (under construction at the time) to the west is  Interstate 895 overpass. We sighted a very odd flying object going from west to east.  What was strange about this is that the object had come in UNDER the electrical lines and was lit up in very bright white lights. The shape was that of a sailor\u2019s cap. This object couldn\u2019t have been 75 feet overhead. The vehicle was maybe 25 feet square and10-12 feet tall.  We had pulled onto the side of the road to watch this spectacle which had also attracted the attention of several vehicles on the northbound side of I-95. The object hovered over the roadway\u2019s columns for a few minutes and then very slowly headed east. I have seen pictures of lots of different shapes of UFOs, but I have never seen or heard of anything like this. Do you have any ideas? We didn\u2019t have a camera or video camera to take pictures of this. All three of us have discussed this several times and agree to what we saw.",

It was a stunning sight and I hurredly called it to the attention of my companion. The formation proceeded in the direction of VEGA, passed to the west of it, veered off to the East and disappeared from our view. The formation was about the size of my hand held at arms length. It was impossible to determine its height. There was no sound at any point. It consisted of about 6-8 indivdual lights. The lights were not spots, but vertical with a slight bulge in the middle. The formation was somewhat triangular, vertical on its left side and sloping slightly outward on the right side. It was traveling wide end or bottom forward. There was no variance in spacing or intensity of the lights nor variation in speed. The night was clear with no haze or cloud cover. The phenomena appeared as if it could have been produced by a searchlight but there was no cover upon which it could have been reflected and no variation in the light as would be seen if on cloud or haze cover. The light was soft and about a 1 in intensity. It did not reappear. There was no airplane traffic in the area prior to, during, or until some time after the sighting. No object per se was observable.

The lights I saw were clearly in motion, moving in a circular pattern, but in a pattern that varied from a solid circular pattern of uniform shaped lights, to certain areas flashing while other areas are black. If it had lasted only a minute, I may have ignored it, but this went on for more than ten minutes, and as I moved along 580, it was clear I was approaching the object.  While I originally thought it stationary, it must have moved at some point because I lost eye contact with it for approximately 2 minutes, then it came back into sight.  I cannot say the exact place I \"passed\" the object, but it was on my right-hand side, somewhere nearby the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Park.

She was having a friend spend the night, and wanted to sleep in the yard in the tent. We started a small fire, set up the tent, and made smores. As night fell, we turned out the lights to see the stars. At approximately 10:20 p.m. we saw an oval object appear in the sky. It hade no definite shape, but was glowing orange on the top half.  My daughter, her friend and myself moved through the back yard to keep it in view around the trees. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon, and moved from our west to south. Its speed appeared to be slower than when we have watched planes. There were no lights (red, blue, green or white), only the orange glow. We all 3 remarked how it looked like something burning. I have witnessed shooting stars, comets, aircraft, hot air balloons, and even the occasional faint satellite, and this was none of those. The size was similar to that of a dime held at arms length. My immediate thoughts were that there had been some sort of disaster with the shuttle or space station. My daughter said maybe a plane on fire, but we figured a plane would not keep speed and altitude if it were burning (plus there were no other lights). I know that the confirmation of 2 11-year-old girls may not hold much weight, but we all saw something very different tonight.",

      "story": "On August 5, 1975, at 6:31 P.M., while I was riding a bicycle, I stopped, along with my friend to watch a beautiful UFO. It was undergoing some changes in function. It was generating brownish-gray smoke back and forth among chambers/holes on its surface. The holes were about 12 inches in diameter each and formed a matrix (grid) pattern spaced 2 feet apart. In the first instance viewing the holes, there were about 25 holes (secont time: 20 holes, third time 9 holes). The craft was semi-egg-shaped, but perfectly oval, not irregular shaped not smallish on one end as with an actual egg). It was about 250 feet long and 150 feet in diameter, about the size of eight houses. It was at first about one-half mile high distant from me, and later moved on about a mile. It seemed very close and very plainly visible to me. It was travelling at the speed of about 20 mile per hour. The smoke was being transferred from each chamber hole to each other chamber hole (as if trying to hide the whole craft maybe, or to generate the propelling system function). A fine cloud or mist of semi-frozen gas, like frozen carbon monoxide or frozen oxygen, nitrogen, helium, amonia, hazy neon, or other gas covered most of the craft, but would be partly covering at an area of one percent of its total surface for one minute while the rest was covered. The uncovered surface measured about 50 feet in diameter on the first uncovering and 40 feet in diameter on the second uncovering. The third uncovering (each uncovering was actually a clearing and diminishing of the misty gas which hid that particular area)was much smaller around 15 feet in diameter. While the partly covered area was visible, I could clearly see the functionality of the craft and watch it while it underwent changes in the skin covering (part of the function of the propelling or the disguise, possibly both a propelling and a disguise). I was aware that I should stare and focus because I knew that it was an important event I was watching. If I had had a picture camera or video camera I would have had an opportunity to capture very intensly important images of the craft and its peculiarities. As I watched for about 4 minutes the craft moved over the intersection at Broad Rock Road and continued travelling but got very fast and left a white cirrus cloud as it went very quickly away. This was a very clear warm day, sunny, with some cirrus clouds around the area of the sky. The sky was blue. The temperature of the air was about 90 degrees fahrenheit. The object left a trail but not necessarily a trail that it had generated, but a cirrus cloud which might have existed with or without the craft. The clouds of smoke of which I have alluded to seemed to be generated for the purpose of causing the craft to be visible or invisible at will as if the craft could manifest itself at will. Or, possibly the craft was absorbing the earth-born water clouds for fuel of some other purpose. I include my personal opinions because I think that my observations are inter-related with the experience, but not in the sense that I creat! ed the e vent in my own mind. I actually saw these things.",

On the way home from T.K.D. lessons, we had stopped in a traffic jam next to a high school football field. I peered out the window to get a better look at the traffic, and in the sky I saw 4 lights in a triangular formation; 3 white lights in each corner of the triangle and a single red light in the center. It was dark, and all I could tell from the lights were that they did not flash or blink in any way. I know that there were some power lines around, but if there was a solid object behind those lights, it was enormous. I'm sure others saw it, but I can't be sure. The craft did move, at a speed I estimate to be about 5 mph. I know that this was not the illusion created from the moving car, as I saw it move even when we were stopped. I didn't bother to tell my mom and sister, as they would just think I was joking. I've heard of the theorized TR-3B \"Government UFO,\" and I think that what I saw might bear a resemblance to the infamous Black Triangle. The lights were still there, even after the traffic started to pick up again. The next day, we took the same route to and from Tae Kwon Do lessons. On the way to our lesson, I looked at the spot in the sky where I had spotted the 3 lights. There was nothing like a cellphone, VOR or radio tower in the vicinity. On the way home, I looked in the sky and the lights weren't there. This still remains a mystery to me, and I'm still investigating this incident.

It wasn't like a star, though. It flashed red and blue on the sides, and actually moved around slowly in the sky. After we started watching it move, we noticed another flying stationary across the other side of the sky. This second light was closer and you could see the colors more clearly. They weren't planes, because they moved whenever they felt like it at whatever speed they wanted. We actually got in the car and chased after the stationary flashing light, but we couldn't get any closer. It was very high and very far. It moved as we chased it though, so as far as I know it could have had a constant slow movement and I just couldn't tell because of the distance. But they did for sure move. They just now got so far that we can't see them anymore, so I came in here and typed this. It was CrAzY.",

      "story": "First 2, then 3 bright lights in the sky; lights eventually disappeared My friend and I were heading home from Colchester to Barre after a night at the drive in.  We were on Interstate 89 heading south just past Exit 14 when I first noticed two bright lights in the sky.  I've sat on the tarmack at O'Hare airport enough to know what planes look like when they're \"stacked up\" waiting to land at night and have their \"landing lights\" on.  That's what I thought I was seeing.  After driving a few miles I could see a plane that was flying very low, coming in for a landing.  This was on the left side of the Interstate near the Williston exit, #12.  Looking to the right I then saw the lights, which I again thought were planes in line to land...but now there were three of the bright lights.  The two on the left were closer together than the one that was farthest to the right.  As we drove a bit further down the road either trees or hills blocked the view of that part of the sky.  I commented to my friend that it seemed very odd that Burlington airport would have 3 planes waiting to land...ever, let alone at that time of night.  He said he thought the lights were too close together to have been planes.  A mile or two down the road, the Interstate curves to the right as it goes down a hill...about 2 miles before the Richmond exit.  I figured that we would have a good view of the \"same\" sky when we got there and then we'd have another chance to look at the lights.  However, we never saw the lights again.  The night sky was very dark, no moon...and no clouds.  I believe that, if the lights had been planes, we would have seen them again as they came in to land.  But we never saw or heard a plane landing (after the one we saw landing as we drove past the Williston exit.)  The lights appeared to be a almost an orange color, but a very yellow-white orange.  Size-wise, the lights appeared bigger than any star or planet I've ever seen in the sky.  I can't say that I saw the lights moving at all, except for seeing 3 lights after earlier having seen 2.  I am reminded of looking a! t Jupite r with the naked eye...but about 4 times larger in apparent size and a corresponding increase in brightness.  The more I replay it in my mind the more I am reminded of how the planes looked at O'Hare airport at night while they are in line waiting to land.  (They also don't appear to move when still far away in the sky because they are, in essence, heading directly at you.)  It was the strangest thing I've seen in the sky in a long, long time.",

      "story": "Cigar shaped object hovered, moved slowly for a short distance, then disappeared in a moment. In the mid to late afternoon on or near the date, May 8, 1989, on S. Laurel Street in Richmond, Virginia, I observed the following.   (I recall it being in the mid-spring, and I remember it being a Tuesday, however as it has been so many years I may be off by up to one year.  i.e. I lived at that address for one whole year.)  As I walked due south on Laurel Street from Carey Street towards my home I noticed a slightly shiny object hovering over the pyramid in Hollywood cemetery.  The pyramid is about 90 feet tall; therefore I estimated the object to be hovering at about 120 feet.  Since I knew I was only 3 blocks from the pyramid I estimated the object to be about 20-30 feet long and about 8-10 feet tall.  The width of the object was not easily estimable but the cigar shape it appeared to have indicated it may have been about 10 feet wide at most.  It hovered silently.  A cigar shaped object with no lights or windows visible and a finish that looked similar to \u201cbrushed steel\u201d, with a slight grain or texture to the entire craft.  It seemed to have a pointed end and a slightly rounder end. As I stopped and stared, it began to move south in a straight path with no altitude change, towards the river which was less than a mile away, and near my home.  I walked at the same pace as it moved while it continued the south, slowly and silently.  Then it stopped and appeared to open a window or peephole on the side facing me.  (It was on my right)  It picked up speed, as if changing from one gear to the next instantly.  I began running to keep up with it and proceeded to seemingly keep up for two or three blocks, so it was still only going a few miles per hour.  Then in an instant, right before it was over the riverbank, it made an angled right turn which turned it about 20-30 degrees to the right (west) and about the same angle in increased elevation while accelerating as a rate I would estimate to be thousands of miles per hour.  Poof!  Gone in a second or less.  I would often describe the angle and acceleration as \u201cimpossible\u201d. In conclusion I would like to add that I made a few calls to the weather services, NASA, and other agencies in and around Virginia and Washington, D.C. attempting to find out more or report the incident and ran into a brick wall.  More than once I was told to \u201cjust drop it\u201d.  At times I assumed it was some military test flight, but in the twenty years since it happened, nothing like it has been produced by our military so I have begun to rethink it. I would describe myself at the time as a college student attending Virginia Commonwealth University.  The campus is only a few blocks from the location of the sighting.  I was about 23 years old.  Again, I may have the date off by as many as twelve months as I lived on Laurel Street from September of 1988-June 1989.   I studied communications, computer science and philosophy.  I have never before or since experienced anything like what I observed that day when I was walking home from class. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The actual date I have now forgotten.  We live on the route of a nearby airport and I see and know what planes flying over looks like and we also live very close to an army depot which reported NO activities this particular evening. We were standing facing the open sky and I saw a glowing green flash hurdle to the ground descending from South to North...  It looked as though it hit the ground less than a visible mile from my house.  (Though we didn't witness ground impact).  The green glowing ball had a tail of sparks trailing behind it.  I have no idea the size of the object, but it was way bigger than a falling star and traveled slower than one time.  By the time I saw it, I had enough time to tell my friend to look too and we both witnessed it fall.   We stood outside long after, nervous of what might happen next and trying to explain what we saw.  Suddenly between 5 and 10 white lights appeared in the sky.  We at first thought them to be airplanes (comparably to the size an airplane light leaves in the sky)  However, these lights were doing figure 8's in the sky and would continuously travel towards and away from one another in a star like pattern.  This lasted for at least 20 minutes, and we had no video c! amera to record it. I called everyone I knew in the area, who also went outside and saw the event of the white lights.  About 15 people witnessed it during those 20 minutes.  I posted that I had seen a UFO of some kind in the area on facebook and got a response from two different people who were traveling a nearby highway who saw the green light also hurdle to the ground.  Both described the sighting exactly how I saw it without my going into detail first. No one ever mentioned the happening again.  I checked the newspaper the next day to see if anything had been said or reported or if their was an explanation and we couldn't find anything.

Then I magnified my picture. Very surprisingly, it was an UFO!  Right after that, I tried to search it out with a zoom lens and ended up with nothing.

The object appeared as only a bright light and had a short contrail \u2013 but was not behind the craft but below it.  The contrail also appeared to be in bursts at times. I called 911 who then transferred me to the tower at Richmond International Airport.  They said they had no \u201creports\u201d.  I then went into the house to find a camera to take pictures \u2013 batteries were dead.  The craft then started on an Eastward path, stopped, and just hovered for at least three minutes since I contacted the tower once again and the answer was the same.  When I informed him that an aircraft was going in that same general area but lower and if they looked up at 11:00 I\u2019m sure they would see it.. Approximately 5 minutes later, three (3) fighter jets were scrambled to the same area and I also witnessed an AWAC (hopefully right) radar plane but not on the same course of the jets, but also going to that general area. At the same time in the West area aircraft were spotted with regular contrails that were a great deal longer than the contrail coming from this craft. The craft could not be seen to assess the shape \u2013 it was basically a light or just very shiny and the sun was just reflecting off of it.  It appeared as almost a \u201cstar\u201d kind of twinkling..",

On September 27th, 2011 I was awoken by my dogs around 4:30 a.m.  As I stood up to go let them out I was distracted by lights out my window.  Because I live in the country, there are few lights outside.  These, however, were extremely bright and appeared to be spinning in a random pattern.  There were three lights that were all the same, but in different areas.  They were very close to the tree line, if not in it.  At that time, they were across the river from me. I watched to see if they could be part of something else, but one of them started to rise up in the air.  At first, I wasn't sure if I could believe my eyes, but it kept going up, then started to come towards my house across the river.  It moved in a 90 degree angle, straight up, then straight out and appeared to do so very smoothly, almost like being on a  conveyer belt.  I lost track of the other two lights when the one started moving. At this point, I grabbed my cell phone to try to video it, but was afraid that it was somehow aware of me, as it was coming straight toward my house.  Because I was nervous I held my phone at my stomach and tried to guess to where to find it to film it.  Unfortunately this was unsuccessful and not the smartest. However, I did, for about 1-2 full minutes watch the aircraft.  It came across the river and right over my garage which is directly outside my window.  My window was already up.  I had a fan running on a table below the window.  The fan is not loud, but the aircraft was so quiet that I turned off the fan to try to hear it, even as it was right in front of me.  I could barely hear it. What I saw was a huge triangular aircraft that was just cruising along.  I can't believe how big it was, how quiet it was, and how slow it was moving.  It had huge round lights underneath.  I could not see the top when it went by, and as it was coming toward me it was dark outside so I cannot say for sure, but it almost appeared to be just a solid triangular mass.  The bottom for sure, and the sides were clear to see.  I was probably no more than 30 feet from it.  I was stunned and didn't chase after it outside, but I wish I did.

Observed for several minutes but gone when I re SF Bay Area - I stepped out on my patio at approximately 0125 hours Pacific time and was just looking around the sky since I'm up all night listening to the radio online.  I saw what I thought at first was an passenger airplane until I noticed that it was not moving AT ALL.  It was just hanging in the sky motionless. I watched it for approximately one minute to confirm it was not moving... then went inside and grabbed my bino's.  I got a clear look at a craft which had 3 bright white lights. It was an elongated oval with the 3 bright lights spaced evenly on it.  I could make out an outline of the oval as well. I watched it for several minutes with my Bino's and it remained motionless in the sky.  The best way that I can describe the lights is as if seeing an auto's headlights thru a slight fog.  This allowed me to see the outline of the object without the lights being too bright to do so. The object was dull gray in color. I was amazed at my luck so I went inside to grab my camera or video recorder but both had dead batteries. I was only inside about 30 seconds... I went back outside to see it again and this time it was gone... not a trace. No man-made aircfaft could disappear from the sky that fast. This object had been inside a slight low cloud cover which was moving briskly due to fast cold winds tonight. From where I was, the pan of the Big Dipper was behind this cloud cover and could NOT be seen through it. The cloud cover was there, and moving fast, the entire time I viewed this object... and like I said, the object was slightly inside the clouds but not deep inside because I could see it easily. After going inside for the camera the object was GONE but the clouds were still moving fast. When the cloud cover past completely I could easily see the entire Big Dipper but there was nothing else there that could have been the the craft... so I know for sure it was NOT any star.

It is thrilling to watch the big jets cross over the highway.  Except this was not a jet.  It was round and silver/white like a perfect mylar balloon with absolutely no markings.  It was very large and was only about 200 feet above the ground.  I looked at the car next to me and as the driver passed me and saw it he pulled hard right across two lanes of traffic and stopped on the shoulder of the highway.  I slowed way down and watched as the circle dropped to about tree height and held position.  As I got closer I was anxious about driving by it but before I reached it, it pulled up a bit and quickly crossed the highway and dropped behind the trees quite rapi! dly.  The most disturbing vision was of the undeniably huge circular shadow it cast and watching that shadow move across the highway in front of me.  At least two other cars pulled over and watched.

We both observed it until it disappeared behind some clouds and we couldnt see it any longer. We went to his house and played video games and came outside to smoke a cigarette and we saw a glowing orange ball about 2 miles away from us.  We weren't very surprised to be honest.  We actually see this type of craft around his house all the time,  the only difference with this time is we saw 16 crafts.  They didn't all look alike though, and they were not all out at the same time.  One of the orange crafts appeared to eject a an object that had red flashing lights on it. I recognized this craft as one of the triangle type ufos that have three lights on the bottom of it.  It got close enough to us to where i could tell that it was not an airplane because there was no noise.  After that, one of the orange crafts got close enough for me to ! see the outline of the craft.  It was disk shaped, just like your standard UFO.  I was even able to make out what appeared to be an observation deck.  However i was not able to see any beings through it even with my binoculars.  There weren't more than three craft in the air at a time, so we could very well have seen the same craft more than once.  But we saw 16 ufos in all.",

I noticed the usual stars that I see every time I walk the dogs along with the moon but tonight I noticed a very bright round light in the sky near the moon along with two dimmer round lights.  All three formed what looked like a triangle formation.  Now what caught my eye was the bigger/brighter light started flickering or pulsing, then the light darkened and I could no longer see it.   After this happened I noticed the smaller one on the left started moving away and eventually went out of view.  The third dim light at that point to me just looked like a distant star that never went away. Now take note that as this was going on I noticed the normal jets flying high in the sky and these lights appeared to me to be higher than the jets.  Being the type of person who likes to find an explanation for everything I checked to see where the space station was currently located and it was flying over the south pole at the time of the sighting.  Now I can't rule out other debris thats flying overhead but it looked very strange to me.  I have also never seen anything that has ever resembled a UFO before or anything paranormal.

There were two to five visible at any given time over this period. They were not directly over our heads, but as we looked NE, some were to our left, and some were to our right.  We could turn to the SE and pick out new ones, and follow them as they flew out of sight to the NE. We think they were triangular because they generally had three lights.  The lights allowed us to see the solidity of the objects.  The objects were moving in the direction of a side of the triangle; a point of the triangle was in the rear.  The rearmost light was blinking while the front two were steady.  There seemed to be more than just the three lights that defined the triangle. Their flight was straight and steady.

      "story": "multiple red round objects grouped in a v shaped form appeared moving across the sky then dissapeared into nowhere \t I live in Richmond, IN 47374. I witnessed something last night i am unable to comprehend. \tOn the night of June 22, 2013 at approximatly 10:30 pm i noticed a group of 5 to 7 red round shaped objects in a staggered v shape followed by 2 more of the same isolated objects.   I apologize for not counting exactly how many there were but i assure you it was 5 or 7 in the first group.  I was somewhat taken back by what i was witnessing.  They appeared at the south horizon just above a tree line.  They traveled at what seemed to be a slow rate of speed northeast toward an almost full moon.   They then began to dissapear individually about fifteen seconds after they appeared to me.   These objects did not move in an abrupt fashion or shift in any way but in a linear motion. \tThis account took place as i was sitting om my girlfriends front porch patio.   I'm an avid star gazer so naturally i was staring at the sky while my girlfriend went inside to grab her sons overnight bag for him. His grandfather was sitting in his truck in the driveway facing north bound. I  noticed the objects and stood up to get a better look at the event and in awe just pointed at the sky, speechless! As the group shaped in the v pattern began to dissapear Missy, my girlfriend walked out of the front door onto the patio. She noticed me pointing at the sky and cuaght sight of the two objects that followed. They then began to fade into the night sky. At first i thought that they had dissapeared behind cloud cover but after further investigation i realized the sky was very clear with no visible clouds. \tIm not sure what i witnessed but i can tell you that ive never seen anything like it before in my life. After discussing the event with Missy i decided to notify someone of the event. I tried to figure out a logical explanation for what i had seen but was unable to. I  wanted so badly to find out if others had seen the same thing so when i woke up the following morning after a restless night of sleeping i immeditely looked in the paper and browsed the internet for other sightings. I then chose to call the National UFO sighting hotline. I truley hope that others will come forward and tell there stories of the same event if they witnessed this unexplained event. Im willing to testify to what i seen.",

They were all heading south east, and rapidly changed direction heading northwest. They moved slowly, and there were no blinking lights indicating human aircraft.  We tried to follow them, but eventually lost sight because of tree lines. Today (August 27) we saw the same ball of orange light.  It was only one this time. We were observing to see if it was the same thing.  We stopped our car to look more carefully when we saw the ball of orange light flicker, as if it were a light bulb.  It wasn't a blink with any kind of rhythm. It flickered about 3 times.  On the third flicker, it disappeared completely.  It was too low in the sky to be covered by clouds.  There were no trees or high buildings for it to go behind in the area. It didn't fade away, it simply flickered and disappeared.",

I drove home tonight, and on my way, as I pulled out of a friends neighborhood, I could see lights behind the trees.  They looked  really big.  So I then pulled out onto route 112 and parallel to the road, directly above me was the HUGE chevron-shaped aircraft.  I feel as though it must\u2019ve been flying way too low to be a plane and way too slow.  It is a full moon tonight so I could see the actual colors of the vehicle.  It was a dark variation of blacks, blues and purples, and the lights were huge like I guessed- white and blue.  They looked like large round stage spotlights like at a concert.  It was like something out of a movie or comic.  The front was the chevron -shape, but the back had three rounded points coming out of the back.  Kind of like if you flipped it upside-down it\u2019d look like the head of  a tulip. Also a few months ago in the same area, but on route 138 I saw two L-shaped crafts flying one after the other.  They had blue and yellow lights. 4 each- al! ternating along the L. I feel crazy.  Haha.  These flew very fast and a bit higher than the giant one I saw tonight. The one I saw tonight must\u2019ve been 8 12 stories high.  It was that big.    After I saw that  one tonight , when I slowed down on the 40 mph road to watch it creep across the sky, I then saw a jet.  The jet was about the size of a star. This craft was probably 100 times larger than the jet that was very far away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.  PD))",

I just left the airport, I was on Richmond Airport Connector Rd. heading back to I-895 when I saw what I thought was airplane light to my right.  It was too early in the morning for a plane to be flying but I thought that maybe it was a plane returning to the airport after being serviced. As I continued to watch the plane I know that the object was not heading for the airport so I figured that it was a private jet servicing one of the companies in the area.  As I watched the object it stopped and a light was bright shining down.  So now I figured that the object must be police and they were looking for something. As I came up on the object, now on my right side, I noticed that it was an object that I had never seen.  It was hovering over the trees but there was no sound and the trees did not move.  The object was round as a cylinder; the inside was hallow except for two cylinders that went thru the middle.  Half way thru these two cylinders split and made a \"V\" shape.  I was near the object for about a minute, then object took off to the north east. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere.

We saw a single light, looked like a fireball and we thought it was an aircraft with bright lights as the weather was a bit foggy.  About one minute later we saw another \u201clight\u201d closely following the first.  We went outside onto our porch as this seemed strange as aircrafts do not follow that closely and suprisingly there were no sounds as a low flying aircraft would make.  Then we saw another light following the 2nd.  There were therefore, three of these \u201cfireball\u201d type lights travelling in a horizontal motion. Then, the 1st light slowed down and descended toward the ocean or probably some other direction and faded.  The other two continued on, maintained a distance within each other and did the same.  By the time we got our camera out, it was gone.  It is 1.18 am and the fog has cleared at least by 50% and we are now wondering if these unidentified flying objects, \u201cfireballs\u201d, were using the fog as a cover whilst travelling.  Interesting Indeed would not believe unless we saw.  Amazing, there really are things out there.",

The lights were only a few hundred, maybe a thousand, feet off the ground. It moved relatively slowly considering, and was in my field of view for more than 30 seconds. What makes me certain it was either a UFO or experimental craft of some sort was that it was absolutely silent. There was zero noise detectable from the ground where I was standing. It just silently and smoothly cruised across the sky. I have 20/20 vision, am 29 years old, and am gainfully employed in the IT field. This is the first UFO I have EVER seen.

On Saturday my sister her husband and my niece and nephew and I where taking a short trip from Barbourville, Kentucky to Lexington, Kentucky to check out the malls.  On the way back home going through Richmond I saw a white light in the sky in front of the car that went from bright to dull to bright again.   Then as the highway made a turn I could see it out of the back passenger side window.  That was when I got a closer look at the thing.  It looked like it was closer to the car by then and I could clearly see a dark triangular craft with white lights on each of the three corners.   The thing was low enough that if it was an airplane it would make noise but I didn't hear a sound from it.   I watched it out the window for about ten seconds then all the sudden it disappears.  Absolutely no trace of the thing.   For about a minute I kept my eyes glued to the window trying to find it but nothing.  My sister's husband saw it too.  I am baffled, airplanes have blue and red blinking lights I know I love airplanes very much.   This was no airplane that I have ever seen in my life.   The first thing I thought to do after our sighting was to report it to you Mr. Davenport.",

We were talking about something or other and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something strange.  At first glance I thought it was a flock of birds in a \u201cV\u201d formation but after I looked closer, I realized they were lights with a reddish-white glow.   There were approximately 10-12 of these lights forming the shape and the V was not a solid shape, with each light moving individually and the \u201cV\u201d shape was changing as well, with one side becoming longer and almost straightening out into a full line as it flew across the sky.  After I noticed it, I pointed it out immediately and the other two people witnessed it as well.  It was a clear night and the lights stood out greatly in contrast to the sky.  The entire event lasted about 20-25 seconds.   The lights came from the north-east sky and travelled of in a western direction.  The lights came overhead of us and past us and then just disappeared from sight.  They didn\u2019t appear to move away quickly as they were before but they just simply disappeared. \tI am a business professional with a college degree and I have never experienced anything like this.  I can usually explain most things of this nature but the way this craft moved was the most inhuman thing I have ever seen.  So fluid and quiet, no sound from engines and each light in the \u201cV\u201d formation was moving independently with all the lights finally almost completely straightening out before disappearing. \tDefinitely strange and most certainly not anything of this world.",

      "story": "Photographed & Videoed Weird Small Glowing Morphing Cylinder-Orb UFO/Entity Hovering in Tree Behind Neighbor's House During a later-than-normal exercise walk I was prompted to notice a small, glowing, weird rod-shaped object hovering approximately 30 feet above the ground in the flimsy, leafy, outer branches of a large tree behind a house in my tranquil, heavily-wooded suburban neighborhood of Stratford Hills in Richmond, Virginia. I'm 54 years old and I've been walking this route nearly every day for ten years and what I beheld at 11:33 p.m. on a very quiet Sunday night was abnormal and totally out-of-place!  Most of my neighbors probably were in bed.  I was fortunate to view the mysterious glowing object that seemed to be hiding up in the tree and I partially attribute my good fortune to the fact that it was a new moon - the darknest night of the month!  The silent UFO first was rod-shaped with a glowing blue light on the left end and a pinkish-violet light on the right end.  It was hovering horizontally in a place where a human could not be.  It was not a new-fangled bug zapper and there are no cable-TV or electric lines running near the tree and definitely not at that height.  No logic for the uncanny faintly-glowing lights in the tree. So I stopped and shot video with my iPhone 4S but with no zoom in vid mode I switched to still-shot so I could peer closer.  I took 30 pics spanning about ten minutes and during this time the small anomalous cylindrical UFO/entity? morphed into an orb which sometimes appeared cobalt-blue and other times violet with a freaky purplish core.  Then it morphed back into a rod that was more white colored and appeared to be segmented, reminiscent of a bacterial rod under a microscope. This flying object ain't one of ours - NOT a drone, stealth bomber, planet Venus, or swamp gas. I did not hear any sounds coming from the object that night but later when I downloaded the video I was surprised to discover that my iPhone had picked up some intriguing clicking noises and when I showed the video to my neighbor S-- she said \"It sounds like Morse code.\"  Not meaning that it actually was Morse code but that it definitely sounded like some form of code and/or intelligently-contrived electronic signal. I stood motionless and alone on the shoulder of the street for approximately ten minutes, taking video and photos, before continuing my usual walking route home as I already was walking later than normal and did not want to be out after midnight.  The small, glowing, cylinder-orb UFO/entity still was hovering up in the tree when I left the scene and I have no way of knowing how long it may have lingered behind my neighbor's house that night?  So far, I have not shared this with the people who live in the house where the sighting took place because I did not want to run the risk of freaking them out, but coincidentally enough, they started leaving their back-porch floodlights on immediately in the wake of me seeing the UFO in their backyard.  I did, however, tell one of their male neighbors and B----- agreed with me that maybe his neighbors who live in the house in question saw the object too and it spooked them?  For the record, my neighbor's back-porch and backyard floodlights again were burning brightly when I passed during my walk tonight, 10-29-2014, before submitting this report to NUFORC. I've been watching for the UFO/entity ever since during my exercise walks but no encore yet, and I wasn't even going to submit a report because I didn't know whether this clicking, glowing, morphing rod/orb was an \"alien/UFO\" or spiritual entity, but then some other odd \"occurrences\" came to my attention that made me change my college-educated mind:  1. My sighting in Richmond was at 11:33 p.m. on August 24, 2014 and just four hours later at 3:30 a.m. on August 25, 2014 a motorist on I-295 N near the Hopewell exit, which is only 22 miles south of Richmond, was followed up the road by a bright UFO orb that was moving a lot faster than manmade highway traffic.  Then the orb targeted another car in the southbound lanes and when the sphere made contact with the other vehicle both the orb and car vanished into thin air!  Then the driver of the first car saw the orb reappear, and when it started following their car up the highway again they became \"terrified,\" put the pedal to the metal, and made a hasty retreat off the next exit in sight.  I learned of this fascinating occurrence at the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). 2.  Then a few hours later around 9 a.m. on August 25, 2014, a seasoned colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve was killed when his F-15 fighter jet crashed under \"mysterious circumstances\" in the Blue Ridge Mountains west of Richmond near Deerfield, VA.  Coincidentally enough, this was in an area where lots of residents have reported UFOs in the sky and orbs near the ground.  They say it took two days to recover the colonel's body and the official Air Force story was that he was from Massachusetts on a \"routine training mission.\"  Synchronistically enough, I also heard  NUFORC's esteemed Director Peter Davenport mention this odd fatal F-15 jet crash in Virginia's mountains during his Oct. 17, 2014 appearance on Coast-to-Coast AM radio with host George Noory.  Keep up the good work Peter as the efforts of you and your associates are greatly appreciated by a world starving for accurate, thoughtful information and truth. I'm not going to speculate or draw conclusions, but it seems like an awful lot of high strangeness for such a small region in ten hours!  Last but not least, a couple of weeks after my \"close encounter\" in Richmond, Virginia USA I was prompted to discover a seemingly-credible YouTube video of a small blue-pinkish-violet rod-shaped UFO that a man and woman in Ontario Canada videoed while sitting around a campground firepit and the anomalous silent hovering object looks uncannily similar to the UFO that I photographed in Richmond, VA when it was in \"rod mode.\"  The Ontario sighting was on August 20, 2014, only four days before my sighting in Virginia, and the Canadian couple was prompted to upload their video to YouTube on August 24 which synchronistically was the same day as my sighting!  Upon request, I will gladly make my photos and video available to Director Peter Davenport and NUFORC.

There was another person walking toward us going the opposite direction over the bridge and when we crossed paths we asked him if he had seen it too.  He said he did and just as we were describing it to each other, we both saw another object flying farther away and in another direction (north), but this one was not blue or particularly lit up.

      "story": "Daytime Sighting of Black Cone-Shaped Object Hovering in Sky On June 28, 2017, I was helping family members move into a new house.  At 2:37 pm, I was driving back to their old house to pick up the next load, when I noticed a stationary black object in the sky above the tree line in front of my car.  The jet black object caught my eye because it stuck out conspicuously against the crisp blue sky.  I immediately realized it was something out of the ordinary.  Excited and perplexed, I stopped the car and fumbled to get my phone out to capture it on video.  The object hovered silently and motionless in the sky.  It appeared to ascend slightly and very slowly at one point.  Otherwise, it did not move at all.  (A close review of the video suggests it also may have rotated along its vertical axis, like a spinning top, but I did not see any rotation while watching it with my own eyes).  It made no sound.  It was shaped like an upside-down cone or pyramid.  It had a distinct, sharp outline against the sky.  It looked dense, heavy and sturdy, and not made of flimsy or lightweight materials.  It definitely was not a natural object (e.g., a cloud or bird).  It looked mechanical, like some sort of machine.  But it did not have any discernable features of an aircraft (e.g., wings, propellers or a tail) or anything else that can fly.  It had no visible propulsion system or other means of flight.  It appeared shiny and shimmered somewhat, which I believe was sunlight reflecting off its surface.  Otherwise, it did not emit any light.  I asked a family member driving behind me if he saw the object (he did) and knew what it was (he did not).  He was not as interested in the object as I was and drove away.  After filming for about a minute, I also drove away because we were on a tight schedule.  I continued to watch the object as I drove and realized it was much higher up and farther away\u2014and therefore much bigger\u2014than I initially thought.  I recorded three videos.  The first one at 2:37 p.m. is through my windshield and, unfortunately, does not keep the object in the frame very well.  I captured the second video through my open window at 2:38 p.m., a few hundred yards down the road.  I stopped again about a quarter mile farther down the road to record the third video at 2:39 p.m.  After that, I continued to look at the object while driving but lost sight of it around 2:42 p.m., when trees along the road obscured my view of the sky.  The last time I saw the object, it was still hovering in the same spot where I first noticed it.  I have speculated that the object could have been a balloon, a kite or a drone.  I ruled out the first two options mainly because it did not behave\u2014e.g., sway, pitch or pivot\u2014like something that was tethered to the ground while flying.  Although a drone is the most plausible explanation, I do not think this was a drone.  The object was too high (~300-1000 ft.) and too large (~5-20 ft. tall) to be a drone, at least one available to the public.  It was also too motionless, for too long.  It did not drift or tilt in the wind; it simply did not move.  Even an experienced drone pilot probably cannot keep one completely still for several minutes in outdoor conditions.  I do not contend that the object I saw was (or was not) extraterrestrial.  I honestly do not know what it was or where it came from.  But I definitely saw something\u2014a tangible object\u2014in the sky that I cannot identify or explain.",

      "story": "UFO disc reflecting sun while hovering silently north of Richmond, VA My girlfriend and I saw what we believe was a shiny metallic disc-shaped UFO while driving our car on I-295 west while exiting onto I-95 south outside Richmond, VA, at 2:10 p.m., Monday, July 9, 2018.  I was driving my girlfriend to her doctor's appointment.  Our sighting lasted about one minute or less.  While slowing to exit from one interstate highway to another I noticed what appeared to be a metallic saucer-shaped craft high in the air.  The craft was north of our position at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  I estimate the altitude may have been 10,000-15,000 feet (higher than a light prop plane but lower than a cruising airliner).  At the time there was a sunny clear-blue sky to the north without clouds and unlimited visibility.  There were clouds to the south but they were not a factor.  I watched the craft trying to determine whether it might be an airplane but there was absolutely no discernible movement, nor were there any FAA lights, markings, noise or! vapor trails.  The disc was hovering and reflecting the sunlight.   I'm 58 years old, BS with honors, am familiar with military and civilian spacecraft and aircraft, meteorology, astronomy, and relatives from NASA, NSA, and Army helicopters.  This craft did not appear to be one of \"ours.\"   After deciding for myself that the craft in question might very well be an extraterrestrial vehicle rather than a man-made aircraft, I pointed it out to my girlfriend.  She observed the shiny hovering disc for about 15 seconds and came to the same conclusion.  My girlfriend also is mature, college degreed, and the owner/operator of an online store.  We both watched the disc hover, seemingly motionless, reflecting the sun, and then it appeared to vanish into thin air without a trace.   We scanned the clear-blue sky but the \"saucer\" apparently cloaked itself, raced off in the blink of an eye, and/or perhaps disappeared into another dimension of time/space.  We did not see or hear a! ny man-made aircraft in the sky in that direction at the time of our disc sighting.  Only the shiny metallic saucer-shaped craft.  No clouds, airplanes or helicopters.  However, both of us heard a military jet fighter roar over our house at approximately 10 a.m. the same day, about four hours before we saw the UFO disc.   We live in rural King William County about 30 minutes northeast of where we saw the disc. We have seen many black unmarked helicopters over our property, and occasional jets, especially in conjunction with other resident's UFO reports, but I believe this was the first jet fighter in a few months and we found it noteworthy since the fighter plane was monitoring our area a few hours before we saw the UFO. Just a \"coincidence\"?  There is an Army base with heliports and airstrips controlled by the NSA, including \"secret\" underground tunnels, about 30 minutes northwest of our home but the aforementioned chopper and jet-fighter flights are not routine and nearly always coincide with MUFON/NUFORC reports by other local! witnesses.  My girlfriend and I believe the ETs are mostly benign and it's the \"shadow government\" and military/industrial/intelligence complex that people should be concerned about.  We believe the ETs probably monitor the shadow government facilities and vice versa.  We believe the latter information and opinion is relevant and should be considered in conjunction with our possible extraterrestrial disc sighting because of the unusual jet fighter roaring over our house the same day.  Note: Our shiny, reflective UFO disc sighting outside Richmond, VA occurred on the afternoon of July 9, 2018, and I reported it to the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) on the morning of July 10, 2018 (MUFON case 93248).    Then on the morning of July 15, 2018 I discovered a NUFORC case from Springfield, VA, about a shiny, reflective possible UFO disc seen in the daytime on July 8, 2018, but posted to NUFORC on July 13, 2018.  The NUFORC case reminded me of our Richmond sighting first reported to ! MUFON.  Bottom line:  Someone in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C, saw a possible UFO disc during the day on July 8 and then my girlfriend and I saw a possible UFO disc during the day outside Richmond (120 miles south of D.C.) on July 9, and a military fighter jet made an unusual pass over our rural home on July 9 about four hours before we saw the disc-shaped UFO.  All just a \"coincidence\"?",

      "story": "UFO disc reflecting sun while hovering silently north of Richmond, VA My girlfriend and I saw what we believe was a shiny metallic disc-shaped UFO while driving our car on I-295 west while exiting onto I-95 south outside Richmond, VA at 2:10 p.m., Monday, July 9, 2018. I was driving my girlfriend to her doctor's appointment.  Our sighting lasted about one minute or less.  While slowing to exit from one interstate highway to another I noticed what appeared to be a metallic saucer-shaped craft high in the air. The craft was north of our position at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  I estimate the altitude may have been 10,000-15,000 feet (higher than a light prop plane but lower than a cruising airliner).  At the time there was a sunny clear-blue sky to the north without clouds and unlimited visibility.  There were clouds to the south but they were not a factor.  I watched the craft trying to determine whether it might be an airplane, but there was absolutely no discernible movement, nor were there any FAA lights, markings, noise or! vapor trails.  The disc was hovering and reflecting the sunlight.   I'm 58 years old, BS with honors, am familiar with military and civilian spacecraft and aircraft, meteorology, astronomy, and relatives from NASA, NSA, and Army helicopters.  This craft did not appear to be one of \"ours.\"  After deciding for myself that the craft in question might very well be an extraterrestrial vehicle rather than a man-made aircraft I pointed it out to my girlfriend.  She observed the shiny hovering disc for about 15 seconds and came to the same conclusion.  My girlfriend also is mature, college degreed, and the owner/operator of an online store.  We both watched the disc hover, seemingly motionless, reflecting the sun, and then it appeared to vanish into thin air without a trace.  We scanned the clear-blue sky but the \"saucer\" apparently cloaked itself, raced off in the blink of an eye, and/or perhaps disappeared into another dimension of time/space.

I noticed one aircraft moving from East to West which is common to see.  It appeared to be at what can described as a normal altitude and speed. I noticed a very bright white light somewhat like a bright star, however it was travelling from the North to the South quite rapidly and looked to be at an extreme altitude.  I thought that seemed out of the norm moving from that direction, and I continued to watch.   The object was moving several times faster than the commercial airliners.    I thought it might be a satellite or the space station and I continued to watch it move towards the South. After approximately 45 seconds or so the object turned to the West at a 90 degree angle without appearing to change its speed.  I still watched the object for a few additional seconds until it disappeared from view. I have no true idea of what it was and I do not recall ever seeing something like that.  I felt uneasy and the hair stood up on my arms.   I went inside to tell my wife what I had just seen and she asked me if I was alright since I had a strange look on my face. Again, no idea what it was, but it was not what I would consider to be a normal experience.",
