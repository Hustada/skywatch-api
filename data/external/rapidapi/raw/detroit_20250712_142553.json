All of a sudden there was a large unidentified flying object just over the houses across the street with flashing red and blue lights.  They screamed and a neighbor 2 doors down was working on his car and he came out yelling \"did you see that?\"  I heard the story a long time ago, and mostly forgot about it. Now that I think about it, the Army missiles were everywhere in Detroit. North and South of grandmothers house.  Really close.  My uncle from Illinois was stationed there.  The ufo was not a mile away from the Nikes. Please feel free to edit this any way you see fit. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I saw lights throbbing like a light bulb going off and on coming from a distance towards my residence.   When the lights came close I saw a large black metal looking craft slowly going forward in the sky.  My view was from the side so I could not tell the over all shape other than to say it looked very angular and had ends that were not simular.  It was surrounded top and bottom by piercing beautiful blue lights.   I was scared but I also felt that the craft was in trouble and had nearly stopped due to what seemed like a power failure. Then it suddenly shot high speed toward downtown Detroit taking a nearly 90 degree turn. I ran in the house AND LOCKED MYSELF IN MY BEDROOM AND CALLED MY MOTHER AND BOYFRIEND.  My boyfriend was at the bar and all of his friends had a good laugh on me.  I told them I was sure others had seen it and  I bet they would hear about it on the news.  I loved the look on my boyfriends face when it later came on the news.   HAHAHA!!!!!",

      "story": "Saw UFO with eyes closed, woke me up with a start from dead dreamless sleep, i live alone!   Very easy to discribe, but you wont believe. I bought a house in detroit, and i lived there about one year and started having dreams about, well everything. Then one day i was sleeping in my bed on my side facing north and I was awoken by a three dimensional triangle. It was like GOD, and totally scared me. it started between my eyes, close to my face and moved to the left in a perfect golden(actually like a silvery) line. I will explain in cartesien coords. positive X-dir points into your face, positive Y-dir points to the right, and positive Z-dir points up. I will use the unit vector space of i+j+k. start to finish it took this path in straight lines. (1,.5,0) (1,0,0) (.5,.5,sqrt 3/4)) (0,1,0) (0,.5,0) a pyrimid!!!!!   saw it with both eyes, and they were both closed. I could not open my eyes until the design was over. It was not a dream. all the lines stayed there and did not fade until the design was completed and then they all vanished at once. I have noticed stange phenominon on the abdomins of bugs. such as little spirts of light shooting directly out of one type of bug butt. all of one kind of that bug on a certain day do it exactly the same, but not at the exact same time. this is wierd because i came back thoughout the day and the light about the length of my fingure nail and as thin as a microscopic wire being lit was the same every time and from every angle, inside the house, and outside in the garden. when i look for them i can see the glittery light in my eyes any time i want now that i know what it is. I assume that it either has to do with getting someones attn. that this is the only way to comunicate from the future. such as the use of a creating a new life force with the message ebeded in the DNA, and the key is to be the first to find the new bug of the year and decode the message. I am the only one i know who also does not remember this bug from the previous year. OK, am i really that off topic? There have been more bugs that I have seen that have come in mass amounts that have not been there the year before. That bug that looks like the ladybug but was a beatle, NEW!!!. the one i saw was black, had a red v on the back and was about 2 cm long. I currently am around the cylotron at MSU alot. I saw one other design that was a flash of about 1/20 th of a second and looked like a non moving design: _ <X>, with a lines on the sides, top and bottom. Like: <|X|> with all the gaps touching                                                -  I have a book on the oldest GOD dating back to 3000 years before the pyrimids were built, THOTH. the design on the cover is,  /\\ /  \\ /----\\ / \\  / \\ /___\\/___\\ , with a dot in the middle. it is black and the design is white. If you add the three designs together you get a 23 line design, in a dream i drew the first 17 lines of the puzzle. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

      "story": "This incident occurred over 30 years ago (1974?) so I will tell it to the best of my recollection.  It was mid September early in the evening, just before the streetlights came on. 2 of my brothers, 2 friends and myself were hanging around out side in front of my parent's home. I noticed a distinct flickering light coming just east of our subdivision, in the sky. I lived right near the Detroit city airport and was used to seeing all kinds of different aircraft. Yet here was this strange flickering light coming out of the eastern sky, catching my attention!  Intrigued, the 5 of us decided to watch the path of this strange moving \u201ccraft\u201d as it continued across the sky due west. I say \u201ccraft\u201d now because at this point, about 5 minutes after we first noticed it one could plainly see what I can only describe as a flying saucer! There it was plane as day just moving across the sky for all to see, a classic type flying saucer. On the out side diameter were these different colored lights, red, yellow and blue. Just moving around clockwise.  Now here's where it gets really interesting, in our subdivision there was a side street that ran north and south, this is where we stood most of the time watching. The\u201ccraft\u201d slowed to a full stop and hovered just above a cemetery that was 3 streets north of ours. It hovered  lower until it was about 60 feet above the ground. If you hold a silver dollar at arms length and held it up at about a 30 degree angle that's  the size it looked in the air. So it was abuot 40 feet in diameter.  The 5 of us thought it was just too cool! I was shaking like a leaf. We watched this thing as it hovered there,just \u201cshowing off\u201d I thought, for about 4 minutes when suddenly it decides to hover on an angle exposing the bottom side of the \u201ccraft\u201d.  It was the weirdest thing, the bottom was just solid black void! If the flickering lights were shut off and the \u201ccraft\u201d  hovered above you ,you wouldn't even know it was there unless it made some kind of noise. I didn't here any distinct sound coming from it from where we stood watching. The \u201cshow-off\u201d decided it was time to move on so the \u201ccraft\u201d straightened  horizontally (like most flying saucers I guess). It began moving straight up in the air until it was about as high as a small Sezna plane would fly. It continued it's westerly path rather slowly, again like a small plane, then suddenly the \u201ccraft\u201d just shot it's self like at warp speed westward and was gone out of sight. \u201cWow!!\u201d I said to myself, \u201cI always wanted to see a UFO!\u201d  A few moments later there were 3 police choppers hovering above the cemetery were the \u201ccraft\u201d was. I never herd or read anything about the incident from the news, \u201cHush-Hush\u201d I guess. If anyone else has seen this sighting, I shure would like to know!

      "story": "Detroit UFO Flap of February 1978 This report is of a historical nature.  I want to emphasize that I did not witness a UFO during the time period described. Back in 1978, when I was in high school, I vividly recall a major UFO Flap that occurred in February and March of that year. My friends and I were very excited by it because almost every day there were reports on the local news and radio about another UFO sighting. Some of them were quite spectacular.  However, this major UFO flap seems to have been forgotten in the UFO literature, so I did some research at a local university library of The Detroit News from that time period.  I was disappointed that only one article was written during that time. The article has been sent electronically via email. It discusses some of the UFO sightings, but not all of them.  The one I remember most distinctly occurred during afternoon rush hour.  The local television news reported that many witnesses reported a low flying UFO buzzed down the I-96 expressway in Brighton, over hundreds of cars. Apparently, many people got out of their cars to get a better look.  This occurred a week or two before the report about the UFO following the park rangers, which is in the article.  I asked a coworker if they remembered the flap.  He said that he did. Surprisingly, he went on to explain that his father was a narcotics detective for the Detroit Police Force and that one of his father\u2019s friends flew the police helicopter. During the time period in question, the Detroit Police helicopter pilot stated that a UFO followed his helicopter. He tried to lose it but could not. I wonder how many other incidents like this may have occurred that were never reported.  I will continue to inquire regarding this interesting time period.  Perhaps other readers of your website remember this flap also and can add further details or historic sources. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

This window is located in my upstairs den. My house is located along a flight path, so I often see planes landing and taking off. I often track them with binoculars and watch the spectacular sunsets and military jets that are routinely streaking across the sky. My kids and I were on our way to dinner so I took a quick look with my binoculars out the window at a cloud bank. That\u2019s when I saw an oval/egg shaped object tipping back and forth but going in a straight line. It was a dull brown in color and the sun was behind it. The strange thing is that when I lowered my binoculars in disbelief; the craft was not visible to the naked eye. But when I raised them it was visible again and still going along the same trajectory which was west to east, I believe. I watched it until it went out of sight from my point of view. It was solid and had to be huge. The way it appeared in my view was as clear and solid as planes at the height and distance have appeared to me. A military jet followed roughly along the same path but above it 3-5 minutes later.  I\u2019ve always believed in UFOs but this is my first sighting. I personally believe they are spiritual in nature but I digress.",

As I was walking I looked in the western sky and noticed a bright star, which was 90 degrees from me. It was unusual but I didn\u2019t pay much attention. As I walked along I looked again and it not only had moved ahead but had gotten bigger which I began thinking was unusual. Walking along about 100 feet further I looked again and it had moved farther ahead and became much bigger. At this point I was nearing the end of the block and started to watch it continually. It started moving closer and became much bigger. The last time I looked I had crossed to the next block and it was hovering almost directly above me. It was a ball perhaps 150 feet in diameter, without sound and had a red light on the bottom. At this time I sprinted the half block to my friends house.",

I don\u2019t make a practice of telling lies or wild stories; I don\u2019t do any drugs, and have no criminal record. I\u2019m not too worried about my privacy as I have nothing to hide, and if anyone has more questions about my sighting I would be happy to try and answer them.  I was on the thirteenth floor of the apartment building I work for in downtown Detroit.  It was a very sunny day, and something in the sky was reflecting the sun light and it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was one of those silver looking aluminum balloons a child might have, but it seemed to be moving towards me at a high rate of speed as it was now much to large to be a child\u2019s balloon.  I can now make out the shape of the craft as it seems to have stopped in mid-air only a few hundred feet outside the window I\u2019m standing at.  It has a clover shape to it.. Three disk shapes connected in the center, with a sort of bulged center area. At this point the craft starts to rotate up on its side, so that the bottom of the craft is facing towards me. I see a blinking red light in the center of the craft and each clover has a large white circular light on it taking up most of the area of the bottom of these three disks. It\u2019s very hard to explain the features of the craft in words.  So at this point it\u2019s been maybe 30-40 seconds that I\u2019ve been watching this thing, and it\u2019s now hovering at a 90 degree angle to me just a few hundred feet out my window on the thirteenth floor.  I start to get the feeling this thing knows I see it and it can see me, as it suddenly displays a light sequence of blue, green, white, and red in an extremely fast flickering pattern. I don\u2019t know how else to describe this light array other than hypnotic in nature, it lasted only a few seconds and when the light show was over, the craft rotated back down from the right angle it was at, and floated off in a south easterly direction (basically directly over Comerica Park) until I lost sight of it.  This is absolutely 100% the truth, and the strangest experience I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I\u2019m not the type of person who looks for these kinds of things or believes every conspiracy theory out there, more than anything else I hope maybe someone else reported the same thing and I can help confirm there story.",

We both looked as if how is it that all of this traffic is moving and no one else seems to see this but us?  It moved so quickly we were lost for words until it left. It actually hovered over us as to observe. There was no sound. It had to be the length of a small home. It only stayed over us maybe 5 to 10 min and than left with the same sharp motion going straight than upwards so very fast. Well we than said very little until later we spoke on it.

      "story": "Rectangular object hovering over downtown Detroit-Windsor area during daylight hours. On the evening of Wednesday, April 13th, 2011, at several minutes after 7pm, I left a friend\u2019s home in Taylor, near the crossing of Telegraph Rd. and Van Born St.  It did not take me long to get back to the highway from her house, after only a very short trip on main roads, a quick gas fill-up at the pump using my card, and then a lengthy stop at a red light, which I suspect puts the sighting at around 7:10 to 7:20 when it began, and lasted for approximately 20-25 minutes in full, though it was not completely visible for me that entire time. I drive a 1997 Pontiac Sunfire, and my sketches include features from my perspective while sitting in my vehicle.  I was driving alone with a cell phone which was packed away in a bag in my passenger seat, and because my dashboard clock does not work, I was unsure of the exact time.  I have no camera phone or other recording device, so I had to document and sketch it from memory.  To my knowledge, there were no other witnesses, although other people were driving on the same road and able to see the same thing, though none seemed to notice. On eastbound I-94 in metro Detroit, near the Southfield Highway intersection, while the interstate is significantly above ground level enough to see the object hovering near the horizon, I caught sight of what I first believed was a banner of some sort, like those trailing behind airplanes (aerial advertising).   Then I realized that this object\u2019s relative position to me and lack of motion meant that there was no plane tugging a banner along, and I surely couldn\u2019t spot a plane of any form near the object.  As I continued to drive, I had to fight with looking over or past other obstacles to my vision while still driving at high speeds during traffic; I did well with this, and there was luckily no danger involved during this period of time.  As I think back on it, I only wish I would have had the foresight to pull off the interstate to a main road where the object was still visible, and to watch it as long as I could.  However, I never came to the conclusion that I was the only eyewitness to this object, and surely I would see some news of it when I arrived home.  If I had the chance again, I would watch it until it left my sight on its own. As I got better and better glances at the object, I continued to move along the highway, making my way for I-75, my ultimate route back home.  At one point, I was angled so that it was visible in my passenger-side window in my direct view, with no obstacles, and showing me clearly that it was not attached to anything, and it was unlike anything I had previously seen or ever heard about here on Earth.  Though I was clearly astonished at the sight of it, I was intent on getting back home, and though I was continuously debunking my own skeptical ideas of what Earthly craft this could be, I was instinctively sure that someone somewhere was getting press coverage of this event at that very moment, and I should get home and watch the news on TV and the net.  Later, when I arrived home, I learned there was no news, no sightings on the TV or internet, and wished I would have taken action then. Because I have seen tethered balloons used as advertising, I even thought maybe it could be something like that, but the better glances I got, the more and more skeptical of my own skepticism I became. Having the object in my sights at several points on I-94, I wasn\u2019t quite sure of where it was, or how far away it was, and therefore \u2013 how large the object might have been.  It was very difficult to discern its exact size and location, and only after looking at a Google Map of the area was I able to determine approximately where it could have been located.  Based on those figures, I would guess the craft could have been anywhere from 300 feet to a mile or more in width, and about one-quarter that in height.  If I had ever seen a rectangular blimp (an object that could hover for extended periods of time, such as this object did), I would believe this could be a blimp, but the whole concept of a rectangular aerial craft defies the use of aerodynamics used in the craft\u2019s design in order to adequately fly the thing around during an event \u2013 this object was clearly rectangular or perhaps even more of a parallelogram, but it had relatively angular and obvious corners, with two pair! s of parallel sides.  When I first spotted the object, I could have sworn it was angled diagonally, making me think it was a banner being pulled by an airplane, though it could have been the curvature of my windshield, since I was looking between the windshield and the passenger-side window, leaning back and forward, ducking my head down and then trying to peer over \u2013 all because it was positioned somewhat behind the car frame bar between those two windows, giving me a pretty precise angle of my first sighting of it, as well as future angles. After I merged on to northbound I-75, I could see the object still in my rear-view and side mirrors, though my curving driving motion made it difficult to keep in my sight at all times.  Then, while on a straight path on the interstate, I got a very clear sighting of it in my rear-view mirror, as well as my side mirror, both separately for several seconds, enough to pinpoint a general location relative to my own position.  I have included drawings of these perspectives in my report, showing the object as it was situated in my view in both mirrors. It was still rather bright daylight outside, with the low sun nearly set, and making the colors of the sky begin to be more vibrant, giving off rosy pink tones and yellow hued light on most things reflecting it.  There were no stars visible yet, and the sky was not really dark enough for them in any location.  There were few clouds, and the ones present were very far away and thin, not having much mass or density.  No other objects appeared as solid and obvious as this one.  I could see no Earthly craft, such as planes, helicopters, or jets.  When I first glimpsed the object it was positioned in a location where it was made somewhat darker, appearing as a muted magenta or deep reddish mauve, and by the time it was positioned clearly in my window it had brightened because of the sun\u2019s light, falling on it and the rest of the horizon. In my side window is where I caught the best glimpse of the object, and is the view I remembered when making my color renditions.  I mostly remember how the light reflected off it: it was solid, a different color than the sky, and reflected the colors of the sunset and sky, though not as if it were \u201cshiny\u201d so much as it was solid and had mass that caught the unique sky colors.  It did not seem to have any writings, markings, or other significant or relevant identifiers, and it not produce light, phenomena, or effects such as that.  I cannot be sure if it was silent or audible, since I was driving in a car. In full, the sites where/when the object was visible were around the Southfield Highway/I-94 intersection, for several miles, and then it was no longer visible because of the elevation of the highway for a large portion of the remaining distance to I-75.  However, it began to be visible again as I could overlook the city of Detroit from the ramp between I-94 E and I-75 N.  By the time I was heading north on I-75, it was visible in my mirrors.  I have attached a map that I got using Google Maps and adding in where I was located when I spotted the object.  Though I placed myself after Southfield Highway on my trip when I first spotted it, when I took another trip on the same route to be sure of my sighting locations, I realized that it may have been before I passed this intersection that I remember being one of my landmarks.  After driving on I-75 for some distance, I was considering getting off the highway and parking somewhere I might be able to view the object, but by that ! time I had a difficult time trying to see it, and figured it best to simply make it home and watch the news.  That was about 1-2 miles before the Davison Freeway (M-8, I believe), ending my active sighting.  I never stayed to see what the craft did, where it went, etc.  I now wish I would have parked to stay and watch it as adamantly as I did while driving on the road. The object did not seem to move, or moved incredibly slowly as if hovering, and though I could not be sure of its absolute motion or stillness due to my own driving motion, I can easily say that it did not change locations much based on the angles at which I could view it \u2013 it must have been hovering or moving incredibly slowly for an extended period of time, and no airplane could have done what it did.  As shown in one of my sketches, I broke down to myself why it could not be an airplane (with a banner or without), a simple helicopter, a military helicopter, or simple blimp, and was left with no options to my knowledge.  After extensive discussion with others as to what I could have been witnessing, the discussions have only proven to show me more ways in which the object that I witnessed was operating and was constructed unlike anything known to myself or the general public.  If it\u2019s man-made, it isn\u2019t publicly accessible. A friend of mine suggested that perhaps it was a Harrier jet (sp?) because they are capable of flying in one relative position for a short period, however another friend of mine who was in the US army in Iraq for three years said that that kind of jet would never hang out in one position for as long as I described, and would use a lot of fuel just to do that, while also making a loud noise that I would have heard even over my vehicle\u2019s engine.  Lastly, though a jet is angular, this object did not have enough angles to make it a jet \u2013 only four angles, and they were simple corners.  Another friend supported my blimp theory by saying that that evening was the first night of the Red Wings play-offs, and could have been a blimp used to record the area from an aerial view. I waited to write this report in order to do some decent sketches and digital renditions of what I witnessed.  Having finished them but still seeing no coverage of the object on local media, I was about to give up my urges to report it and move on to other issues in life.  Then I saw this article (http://www.examiner.com/ufo-in-national/rectangle-ufo-appeared-a-liquid-state-over-texas?fb_comment=32512566) which described an object spotted in Texas that sounded as if it appeared similar to what I saw here in my own state.  After realizing that this thing may have made a re-appearance elsewhere, I knew I had to reveal my sighting to the world the right way.",

      "story": "I saw a hollow, cylinder shapped object the color of a bubble, or rainbow,  hovering and spinning above a bush. Between noon and 2:00 p.m. on March 17, 2012, I went outside to get something from my son's car and noticed smoke that seemed to be streaming from a bush in the front yard on the East Side of the house that is directly across the street from my house.  There are two bushes in the front yard of the house.  One on the East side.  One on the West Side.  The entire yard is surrounded by a fence. The smoke traveled four to five feet from the bush to the rear of an SUV which is about eight feet from the fence that surrounds the house and the bush.  First I thought the bush was on fire but I didn't smell smoke, so I just felt some mischevous guys were hiding behind the bush smoking, or trying to break in the house. I walked across the street to the bush but no one was there, just smoke, with no smell, which was strange.  The bush was opened and the stems seemed old.  Because I had never seen them open like that in the fourteen years I lived here, which was also strange, I hurredly walked back to my house and stood on the steps and remained there because I was a little puzzled by all this. The smoke disappeared. Suddenly a lot of little flies or knats like the ones that gather in the middle of air appeared over the bush that the smoke seemed to be coming out the bottom.  Then a cylinder looking thing, not of this world appeared from no where on top of the bush and started spinning at a high rate of speed.  It was the color of a rainbow, translucent, with no top, or bottom (hollow inside).  It was the size of the middle of a wooden wine barrell. After the translucent, bubble like, bubble colored, rainbow colored cylinder hovered and spun over the bush about a minute or two, smoke started coming out of the center of the cylinder, seemingly from the middle of the bush. Strangely, the birds and pheasants eating grass seeds in the lot adjacent to the house appeared unscathed and did not fly away.  The bush did not burn, the smoke did not smell like smoke, or fire. Next, several of the little flies appeared on top of the bush on the West side of the house.  The cylinder started to sail to the bush on the West. The knats were still flying over the bush on the East where the cylinder was at first, but half of them seemed to be gone.  When the cylinder reached the bush on the West side of the house it hovered on top, still spinning at an out of this world speed.  Smoke came out of the middle of that bush which was not smoking at first, and did not burn.  It hovered there a couple minutes (the cylinder like thing).  Next the cylinder floated up, spinning all the time, to about the height of the light post in front of the house.  Smoke then flowed from the bush on the West, through the center of the cylinder.  In an instant, the bubble thing disappeared.  Next the smoke dissipated. My girlfriend called about this time.  I told her what I saw.  She asked if it was on my property.   I said no.  She asked if I looked down in the bushes.  I said no, and told her she should come over to look down in the bushes. I told her that I noticed several (about ten) thin, translucent lines, like spider webs, the same rainbow color of the bubble like cyliner, in front of my house.  The web like strings were in mid air and extended straight, from the West to the East in about 20 feet from the no parking sign by my house to nowhere. They were affected a little by the wind, but strangely, just floated straight across in a parallel line without falling.  The spider web things did not appear to be attached to the cylinder- bubble, but also, were not of anything I've ever seen on Earth, or could imagine.  They were the identical color.  I probably walked through them when I went across the street but the did not break, or fall. My girlfriend said run in the house, slam the door, and pull down the shades.  For some reason I was not scared but I did go in the house, close the door, and close the blinds. I peeked outside and saw the smoke again on the ground by the bushes but I had seen enough and do not know if anything else happened because about this time I began to feel a little leary and would not go, or look outside. Another strange thing happened.  The next day when my girlfriend came over to see.  She asked if I ever looked in the bushes.  I told her the bushes did not go anywhere for her to go look. Even though she wasn't going to look inside the bushes, the strangest thing happened.  When we looked across the street at the bushes, the bushes had closed all the way up, and were full, like they normally are.  The way they were opened when the cylinder appeared, it would be impossible for the bushes to close back to normal in one day, or a year. I told a couple other people and asked a couple farmers if fruit flies made these type of cylinders.    Then, I stopped becausethe people I told, and the farmers did not seem to believe I had seen something like that. However,I turned on the radio late one night.  Coast to Coast was on. The UFO man was a guest and left his number.  I called him and he said he didn't want to hear my story, I had to write it down. I didn't write it down because what I saw did not appear to be a UFO. Today I googled UFO and read some of the sightings.  One of them was identical to what I saw.  For this reason I have written this story.  Perhaps it can help others.",

As it got closer to me I noticed that it didn't look nothing like an airplane.  It was diamond shape.Airplanes usually have those red and blue lights flashing on them. This was a continuous white flashing light crossing the sky. I watched it for as long as I could and even walked over towards my neighbors house to keep it in sight. It was moving fast unlike the two objects I saw earlier. For as low as it was there was a slight sound to it that should've been louder like the airplane flying over me now. at 23:34 heading into the eastern direction. I can hear that plane loud and clear. But the objec! t in question I could barely even hear and it was lower than the one heading east. They didn't even blink the same. The object in question was very bright. It blinked rapidly with only white lights. I don;t know what it was, but it wasn't a normal airlines plane. And it wasn't no meteorite either. And if you say it was a weather balloon then I'm a monkey's uncle. That's how serious I am. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

ASn airplane flew just in front of the first one and lept goin heading east. The plane flew higher than most planes but it was still closer than this object.  Both objects to be exact. I watched this object for about 40 seconds and then lost track of it.  I scanned the sky and found another extremely faint light traveling due south off to the righ of where the original spotted light was. I don't wear glasses and I could still see this light even though it was very faint. That's why I knew that these two objects weren't traveling in our atmosphere. It was way fainter than the International Space Station would appear in the sky. Besides I don't think the ISS would travel in two opposite directions. The time was 10:35 p.m. Venus is much brighter than what ! they were. But these were white lights with no sound at all.

      "story": "Response to SHGbo+14a. Logansport, IN This is a copied article, posted as requested. These articles cover rare information on SETI signal SHGb02+14a  [Article 1] Mysterious signals from light years away  19:00 01 September 2004 by Eugenie Samuel Reich  In February 2003, astronomers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) pointed the massive radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, at around 200 sections of the sky. The same telescope had previously detected unexplained radio signals at least twice from each of these regions, and the astronomers were trying to reconfirm the findings. The team has now finished analysing the data, and all the signals seem to have disappeared. Except one, which has got stronger. This radio signal, now seen on three separate occasions, is an enigma. It could be generated by a previously unknown astronomical phenomenon. Or it could be something much more mundane, maybe an artefact of the telescope itself. But it also happens to be the best candidate yet for a contact by intelligent aliens in the nearly six-year history of the SETI@home project, which uses programs running as screensavers on millions of personal computers worldwide to sift through signals picked up by the Arecibo telescope. Absorb and emit  \"It's the most interesting signal from SETI@home,\" says Dan Werthimer, a radio astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and the chief scientist for SETI@home. \"We're not jumping up and down, but we are continuing to observe it.\"  Named SHGb02+14a, the signal has a frequency of about 1420 megahertz. This happens to be one of the main frequencies at which hydrogen, the most common element in the universe, readily absorbs and emits energy. Some astronomers have argued that extraterrestrials trying to advertise their presence would be likely to transmit at this frequency, and SETI researchers conventionally scan this part of the radio spectrum. SHGb02+14a seems to be coming from a point between the constellations Pisces and Aries, where there is no obvious star or planetary system within 1000 light years. And the transmission is very weak. \"We are looking for something that screams out &#145;artificial',\" says UCB researcher Eric Korpela, who completed the analysis of the signal in April. \"This just doesn't do that, but it could be because it is distant.\" Unknown signature  The telescope has only observed the signal for about a minute in total, which is not long enough for astronomers to analyse it thoroughly. But, Korpela thinks it unlikely SHGb02+14a is the result of any obvious radio interference or noise, and it does not bear the signature of any known astronomical object. That does not mean that only aliens could have produced it. \"It may be a natural phenomenon of a previously undreamed-of kind like I stumbled over,\" says Jocelyn Bell Burnell of the University of Bath, UK. It was Bell Burnell who in 1967 noticed a pulsed radio signal which the research team at the time thought was from extraterrestrials but which turned out to be the first ever sighting of a pulsar. There are other oddities. For instance, the signal's frequency is drifting by between eight to 37 hertz per second. \"The signal is moving rapidly in frequency and you would expect that to happen if you are looking at a transmitter on a planet that's rotating very rapidly and where the civilisation is not correcting the transmission for the motion of the planet,\" Korpela says. This does not, however, convince Paul Horowitz, a Harvard University astronomer who looks for alien signals using optical telescopes. He points out that the SETI@home software corrects for any drift in frequency. Fishy and puzzling  The fact that the signal continues to drift after this correction is \"fishy\", he says. \"If [the aliens] are so smart, they'll adjust their signal for their planet's motion.\"  The relatively rapid drift of the signal is also puzzling for other reasons. A planet would have to be rotating nearly 40 times faster than Earth to have produced the observed drift; a transmitter on Earth would produce a signal with a drift of about 1.5 hertz per second. What is more, if telescopes are observing a signal that is drifting in frequency, then each time they look for it they should most likely encounter it at a slightly different frequency. But in the case of SHGb02+14a, every observation has first been made at 1420 megahertz, before it starts drifting. \"It just boggles my mind,\" Korpela says. The signal could be an artefact that, for some reason, always appears to be coming from the same point in the sky. The Arecibo telescope has a fixed dish reflector and scans the skies by changing the position of its receiver relative to the dish. When the receiver reaches a certain position, it might just be able to reflect waves from the ground onto the dish and then back to itself, making it seem as if the signal was coming from space.  \"Perhaps there is an object on the ground near the telescope emitting at about this frequency,\" Korpela says. This could be confirmed by using a different telescope to listen for SHGb02+14a. Possible fraud  There is also the possibility of fraud by someone hacking the SETI@home software to make it return evidence for an extraterrestrial transmission. However, SHGb02+14a was seen on two different occasions by different SETI@home users, and those calculations were confirmed by others.  Then the signal was seen a third time by the SETI@home researchers. The unusual characteristics of the signal also make it unlikely that someone is playing a prank, Korpela says. \"As I can't think of any way to make a signal like this, I can't think of any way to fake it.\"  David Anderson, director of SETI@home, remains sceptical but curious about the signal. \"It's unlikely to be real but we will definitely be re-observing it.\" Bell Burnell agrees that it is worth persisting with. \"If they can see it four, five or six times it really begins to get exciting,\" she says.  It is already exciting for IT engineers Oliver Voelker of Logpoint in Nuremberg, Germany and Nate Collins of Farin and Associates in Madison, Wisconsin, who found the signal.  Collins wonders how his bosses will react to company computers finding aliens. \"I might have to explain a little further about just how much I was using [the computers],\" he says.  Ref: http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6341-mysterious-signals-from-light-years-away.html?full=true   [Article 2]  Radio source SHGb02+14a  Radio source SHGb02+14a is a source and a candidate in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), discovered on March 2003 by SETI@home and announced in New Scientist on September 1, 2004.[1]  The source was observed three times at a frequency of about 1420 MHz,[2] which is expected to be a frequency used by extraterrestrials due to its proximity to one of the main frequencies at which hydrogen absorbs and radiates photons.  There are a number of puzzling features of this candidate, which have led to a large amount of skepticism. The source is located between the constellations Pisces and Aries, a direction in which no stars are observed within 1000 light years. It is also a very weak signal. The frequency of the signal has a rapid drift, which would correspond to it being emitted from a planet orbiting nearly 40 times faster than the Earth around the sun. However, each time the signal was detected, it was again at about 1420 MHz, the original frequency before any drift.  There are also a number of potential explanations for this signal. SETI@home has denied media reports of likely extraterrestrial signal.[3][4] It could be an artifact of random chance, cosmic noise or possibly just a glitch in the technology.

I\u2019m not sure the day or the exact month, it was either September or November.  The time was around 11:00-12:00 noon.  I was at work in Detroit.  My office was at the Renaissance building, with my desk having a window view facing the city of Windsor, over looking the Detroit River. While I was busy talking on the phone, I noticed a small, bright light that was traveling up the river that had just passed the Ambassador Bridge that connects the USA with Canada.  At first I thought it was a small airplane or something similar, until it was close enough to notice it was a round shaped sphere.  It had a very highly polished metal that was reflecting the Sun and giving the appearance of a lighted craft.   My co-worker and I both looked taken back, as this machine was bopping up and down in the air over the river, about 20 feet or more above the surface.  It was about 10 feet in diameter or so it appeared. It made no noise, as all craft that travel on the river or anywhere in our tower can hear just about all noises from vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, etc.  The building is not very good for keeping sounds out. This machine was solid looking all over, no visible portals or attachments.  It had a round, small black little ball that traveled around the object about every second that was not attached.  The sphere turned in front of the Renaissance building and headed toward the Canadian side of the river.  Went up and over the Windsor hotel, still not high in the air, about 20 feet or so.  Weaving, bobbing ever so slightly, not traveling as though it was in a hurry, but rather seemed to be checking things out is what it felt like to us.  It climbed up and went up into a small black rain cloud.  The black rain cloud looked odd to us for some reason.  Also, it was the only cloud visible on a clear blue day.  I could see jets taking off in the background at the Windsor airport.  My co-worker and I watched the rain cloud for a long time, at least 5-10 minutes, until the cloud dissipated.  The machine never came out or went through the cloud to the other side.  I inquired with people in the building ! who would have had a good chance of hearing or seeing anything that goes on in the area.  As far as I know, we were the only people to see it, but I find it rather hard to believe, as this was broad daylight during lunchtime in downtown Detroit.

A friend of mine was following me, so I pulled over and asked her what is that, her and her passenger looked and said what the hell is that,   I then looked around to see if anyone else had witnessed what we was seeing, people in the barbershop was looking, people that was coming out the grocery store was looking and some traffic had stopped and was looking,   I turned back and looked at the objects and called my wife on her cell phone but I kept going to voicemail so I called my daughter and ask where was her mother and to go get her and look out the back window and look at all these UFOs in the sky, she woke up my wife and told her, all I can hear was my wife saying oh s***, what is going on an invasion, now all 15 or 20 of them were in a pyramid formation, I noticed that the last two on the left was coming down and stopped and went back up, they then lined up in a straight line never making a sound, they was changing colors red,orange, yellow and getting brighter they hovered a little more and then slowly moving towards northeast very slow still not making a sound I then started driving home but still looking at them, when I pulled in my driveway and could still see the last two of them and I noticed the last one was getting so bright it looked like it had a ring around the bottom that really kept getting brighter like it was drawing energy from something, it looked like a donut shape or Saturn ring, I went in the house and talked to my wife and daughter and said I'm about to follow them but when I went back outside I didn't see them anymore,I drove in the direction that they were going still didn't see them, and then rain just started pouring down instantly, I drove back home and called fox 2 news to report the objects and the news said that they had several calls about that and was waiting on video footage",

But the rate of which the sound approached and dissipated was far too fast for a commercial jet.  Not to mention so loud, it would have been at a much lower altitude. Ive witnessed large meteorites witnessed over multiple states. I've also witnessed jets breaking the sound barrier.  This did not sound like that at all.  No impact, shockwave or sonic boom was heard.  The third witness, approximately 1.5 miles west, and outside during this event, heard it, but did not notice any lights either. Strangely, this past winter, we heard what sounded like pulse jets on occasion.  Usually at night, once during the day.  Think Nazi V1 buzz bombs. Internet searches yielded no results pertaining to aircraft making such noises in cold dense air.  Somethings definitely going on over Southeast Michigan the passed few months.",

In general it was moving east parallel to the river.  It might have made a 'adjustments' in its movement a couple times.  Slight right turns toward the river.  Its movement was not always steady or at the same (slow) speed.  Clear night with some wispy white clouds.  After watching it just a few minutes it disappeared into a cloud.  Don't know how long it had been there before I came out at 10:20. Its height or size was that of a small plane flying at the top altitude allowed by small planes over a city.  Not the lower altitude at which a plane flying over a baseball game might be.  A neighbor was able to see it without their glasses. I searched this description, and found a lot of images matching what I saw.  The colors of fire.  Not a single spectrum red or orange light.  There was nothing else in the sky.  Quiet.

Last night (08/09/2016) I lay in my bed watching Netflix as my fiancee goes to open the front door for his friend.   After a short while, they both call my name, screaming.  The way that they were yelling made me think my cat had run into the street and got hit or something.  I jumped up and ran outside, only to find that his friend saw orange orbs in the sky.  At first, I was calm, and I replied, \u201cOh, I see these all the time I told you ufo are real... I see them all the time.\u201d  His friend thought my statement to be strange; she suggested we go inside but at first, I wasn\u2019t afraid because I see them all the time.  She was so frightened that she left.  My fiancee decided that we needed to record this, so he went inside to look for my real camera.  Now I will describe what we saw. On Bryden St., between Joy Rd and Livernois, we spotted 12 orange orbs popping up in threes to the left of the sky just over Dearborn, Michigan, Warren Ave, and Wyoming area if you were facing west like we were.  The orbs appear from nowhere low in the sky and slowly floated up over the clouds.  Once they got high over the clouds, they changed to match the clouds they became the same color and even made themselves appear the same texture as the clouds, however, they had become disc shaped.  Once in this form, they floated across the sky towards us which was north to joy from Dearborn.  They appeared to glide across the sky, and they were silent.  Once directly over my hear I could see two dark gray circles on the bottom of the craft spinning.  Once they got just across Joy Rd almost to Chicago on Central, they began to lower they turned dark grayish black and dropped down from the sky to the ground. At that point, I was crying and panicking because I never saw them do that before, and they seemed to be trying to be invisible, and I was terrified, so I ran into the house crying.  I called my best friend the only person who would believe such a crazy story, and she doesn't believe in ufo, but she believes in me\u2026 she calmed me down and told me to pack an emergency bag just in case.  Last night I could barely sleep I was so scared.  I woke up today trying to tell myself it wasn't real.  I have no one to turn to, and life feels very different to me now.  I don't know what to think or how to feel or how to function without feeling like I'm going insane.  I hope that rant made sense.",

It appeared to be at an extremely high altitude (if even in the atmosphere).  Its size resembled that of a star in the sky.  It displayed inconsistent flickering, which slowly faded out after approx. 1.5 to 2 minutes.  Object moved in a consistent path/line from southeast to northwest, at a constant, slow speed.  There was no trail/tail either.  The object did not emit any sound. As a side note, according to aerospace.org, there were no reentries since September 3rd, with the next being September 15th.",

One minute later the craft accelerated so quickly it disappeared within seconds, again no sound whatsoever.  We couldn't believe what we saw.

      "story": "Oval object with depth stationary, viewed from plane I'm an engineer, I was on a plane flying to Detroit.  I was looking North at a break in the clouds.  I could see green farmland below through the clouds, the clouds were thicker on the East & West sides as the break in the clouds gave me the ability to see the ground below.  The plane was approximately 25,000 feet up.  I would not have noticed anything if the object didn't move at this very moment, it was stationary right next to the West cloud, then it moved forward some, then to the right then forward again to then hide in the East side cloud edge.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  The object was oval but it had depth and the top surface was pure white.  This oval was the shape of a track & field track, so parallel in the middle with rounded ends.  But the top surface was perfectly flat, and pure white. I would not have seen it, if it didn't move.  The sides were a grey/white color,  I could see very thin vertical black striations.  The object was rigid, the top white surface came to a very obvious edge, then 90 degrees straight down.  The vertical drop was what appeared to be about half what the short length width was.  The object had no obvious propulsion mechanism, no observable heat waves, no radiations, no light emmissions that I could see.  It did not tilt to move forward, did not tilt to the side, then did not change its orientation to move forward again.  It just moved, I believe  I would have missed it if it didn't move at all.  From my eyes it was approximately an ! inch to 1.5 inches in length.  Length is the rounded ends to each other, width then was the parallel sides to each other, depth was the white edge to the bottom of the grey striations.  The bottom also came to a very rigid end. This object definitely appeared to be hiding in the clouds.  No windows, no radar apparatus, no spinning anything, no external attachments.
