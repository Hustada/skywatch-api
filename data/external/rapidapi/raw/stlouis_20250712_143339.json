      "story": "Observation of spherical white colored craft in geostationary position for 1 hour plus. The altitude at a guess at 2,000 feet high. This was seen on September 4, 1962 at 3:30 pm Central Standard Time. Location of sighting was 2.6 miles south of St. Louis Lambert airport. The sky was clear and wind was calm. My mother was hanging clothes out to dry, and called out to me to come out and see the object. I rejected her offer for some time, but she insisted that it was  something I should see. When I finally went out and saw the object we talked and she asked if it could be Venus? I told her that it could not be because of the time of day and direction was eastward. I was a member of the St. Louis Astronomical Society at this time. My mom said I should get my telescope and take a look. At the age of 15 I wasn't totally coordinated yet, and I broke the front glass out of the front screen door. Trying to get the telescope out the door. I'm adding for the time frame. It took a bit of work to gather the broken glass up before a got the telescope to the back yard. Setting up the telescope. It was a Tasco refractor 60 mm objective lens, with a alt-azimuth mount. I first used the wide angle eyepiece to spot the object. I found it magnified well, but still rather small. I let my mom look through the scope and by this time we had the next door neighbors over also. So now we have our own star party. Three adults and one kid. I let everyone take there time and look. Of course they all asked if I could get it bigger. I set the 3 X barlow and the strongest eyepiece. This set the magnification of 525 power. When I looked at the object it nearly filled the entire field of view.  I can only explain that I had it focused perfect!  It looked like a cue ball.  No markings.  Perfectly smooth and rather off white, not shiny.  It did not give any glow off.  No sense of spinning motion, and no noise at all. This is important. This object has not moved one nanometer in an hour of time. Nothing in the heavens or earth can do that!  When you view the moon at full power with that telescope it's like a big train moving by. This didn't move. I expected it to move and was in total disbelief at what I was seeing. I let my mom and the neighbors husband and wife both take long looks at the object and we all agreed that it was not moving. I kept saying this can't be happening! No one is going to believe me at the next Astronomical meeting. But I got witnesses!  Better yet I've done lunar eclipse photos, and said I will be getting my camera and special eye mount for it and I'll be back. Never had a chance to move. When we look back at the time in history, it was as one of the worst in nuclear confutations. The \"Cuban missile crisis\" was happening. I no sooner said that I was going to get the camera when I hear a very load jet aircraft take off. Living for many year near the airport we grew accustomed to the different sounds of the commercial, and air force aircraft flying and even crashing near by as a F-86 did a mile down the road. This was the sound of afterburners and full throttle. As soon as the plane came above the tree line I spotted it as a B-47. She was doing a tight circle as we literality turned our bodies around as it circled and climbed for altitude. On the second sweep around I was beginning to wonder if it had something to do with our visitor in the sky above. I was a lucky hunch, because at that very moment I scream! Look it moved! What had been stationary for an hour did a sudden straight vertical movement to twice the altitude in a split second and stopped. The B-47 was still in hot pursuit with all engines at full throttle. It kept a circular pattern as she climbed up toward the object. After about the fourth revolution around the B-47 chase was over. I saw the object go from that second position to ascend straight up out of sight. My mom insisted that I report this to the Air Force base at Lambert Field. I looked up a few numbers that sounded official and dialed them. When I mentioned I wanted to report a UFO, they responded I could get in a lot of trouble doing this. Did my parents know I was doing crank calls to the US Government? The last call I made I did get through to an Air Force official and said I wanted to report a UFO and it was being chased by a B-47. He said that's ridicules there's no B-47 aircraft in the air. I said if you don't believe me look out your window. He hung up quickly.  No report was ever made to the papers that I could ever recall. Iwould like to know if anyone in the St. Louis area saw this object also.",

      "story": "UFO's over  Saint Louis and Metro East Counties. It was about 4 AM on the night of January 15th 2004, When my friend and I were driving home from another friends house in Belleville IL. Between Belleville and Centerville IL, there is about a 5-8 mile strrtch of wood encompassed Highway, and thats when we saw and experienced the following events: About a mile or so past Fairview Hieghts, I inexplicablly had the sensation to look over my shoulder and to the left of me. At that moment I noticed something very out of the ordinary. Shining down on the surface of the adjacent, Westbound side of Interstate 64/40 were three blue circles of light. Even stranger, was that these concentric circles were pacing our car...in the same direction we were traveling, on the opposing westbound highway. Then what seemed to begin happening is that a state of...Oh well,What can I do...feeling came over me, not fear or panic, just....Oh well. My friend looked over after I said to look, she looked back at me, we looked at the clock on her car radio and it read 4:05 AM. We looked back at the lights and then eachother, and the next thing I knew it was 4:30 or so by the radio clock and we were entering the highway interchange near Centerville IL. about 6 or 7 miles from were we had just been! To this day me and my girl still talk about it. We also saw about a Year later, another strange object at her apartment complexs in Kirkwood Missouri. It was about noon, in the broad day light. I went out onto her back patio to smoke a cigarette, and as I was lighting it, I looked up to my left to see a jetliner cruise by and its contrail forming. Only, at the end of the contrail, and seemingly following the jetliner, was a bright green, glowing sphere of light. As soon as I noticed it though and called for my griend to qiickly grab her camera, it seemed to take notice in me. It bounced arounded and darted from point to point in the sky, almost as if it were putting on a show for me, just to make a point of saying \"Hi you can see me, I also see you.\" It kept this up until my friend returned with her camera, at which point this object shot right to my zenith. She quickly snapped a picture, and with that the object simply zipped off out of view. Although we knew whatever came out on that film would be low and questionable quality, nontheless we were still excited to see what we did have on it. When the film was developed though, oddly, every single print was blank.",

It rotated about 45 degrees, then it descended slightly, rotated again i could see heat wave coming form under the back of it and it looked as it had a small blue flame like jet purpoltio.

He said, \"I thought I'd ask you to grab your camera but I didn't want you to miss it, it was moving so fast.\" Seconds later we heard another aircraft off in the distance, like a 747 airplane, not sure if it was following.

Back in May there was a lot of hype about the BLUE MOON & JUPITER coming from SpaceWeather.com \t At around 10:50 (May 31st, 2007) I went out to view the BLUE MOON & JUPITER.  I was standing on my deck facing the East and slightly South when I saw what looked like a vertical column/vapor/cloud to the left of Jupiter.  There was a something that looked like a star rising up and out of it but then disappeared the higher it went.  To the right of the moon I could see a dim star.   I live in the city of St. Louis and most stars are lost in the night sky for us. This just felt a little weird but I am sure there is a probable explanation. After about twenty minutes I went back out on the deck to look at the BLUE MOON & JUPITER again. When I looked up I saw a small airplane with what I will call a vapor coming out of the back.  It was really up high and very small.....in the daylight it would look like smoke coming out of the back of it like when we were kids......could this have been a crop duster and do they do that at night?  It was flying like an airplane NOT LIKE WHAT I SAW EARLIER. That STAR LIKE object seemed to be rising up and out of the vertical column of cloud.  I know the difference.  I have gone over this incident a hundred times in my mind and yes, I do realize that very often we don\u2019t always see what we think we see but I wanted to tell you about it anyway.  I am 66 years of age but this is one of the strangest things that I have ever encountered.  By the way I did check the news on the computer the next day to see if anyone else reported it but could not not find anything.  Then I rationalized that there were certainly enough people viewing the BLUE MOON that night and surely someone other then myself would have seen it.  So now I am left with the dilemma of what was it if anything?????  Carol  From SpaceWeather.com\u2026..  BLUE MOON & JUPITER:  Tonight's Blue Moon has a companion: Jupiter.  All night long, the giant planet will be located right beside the Moon.  You can see them with the naked eye or, for a real treat, scan the pair with a backyard telescope.  Behold the moons of Jupiter, lunar mountains and craters, and maybe even the Great Red Spot: sky map. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.

      "story": "Orange Ball UFO chased by F-4 military fighter jet with abrupt maneuvering by UFO and impossible speeds. With my best friend from school, while in the side yard at his house, we heard loud sound of jet plane coming over trees in park across the street. In less than one second there was an F-4 fighter plane chasing a glowing orange ball about 20 feet in diameter, 75 to 80 feet in front of the F-4. They flew almost directly over our head at less than 200 feet. The F-4 and the glowing orange object continued out over the adjacent interstate highway for a mile or so, toward the River de Peres. Before they got to the river, still at just above treetop height, the orange ball abruptly changed direction by approximately 90-degrees, and increased speed to the point that it was able to cross half the sky (60 degrees of angle) from left to right and achieve an altitude of 10 miles or more, in less a quarter second. The object then, just as abruptly, stopped dead in the sky, and it appeared to be taking a position so as to better observe the F-4 as it banked around looking for it. Or so it seemed to a 13-year-old\u2019s imagination. After the glowing orange object abruptly changed course, the F-4\u2019s engines--previously very loud--suddenly became almost silent, and he banked right and left a couple of times as if he were looking for the object. He then continued for a couple of seconds, and made a wide sweeping turn over the River de Peres, and doubled-back over his previous path. After a few seconds, the glowing orange spherical object sitting still in the sky shot away at incredible speed and was completely out of sight within an eighth of a second. It has been many years since this occurred, and I just want to make sure that it gets reported. Back then it never occurred to me to report it; much less did I know whom I would report it to. I have discussed this with the other witness as recently as 14 years ago, and our recollections were very similar, but not in the level of detail as I have included, herein. For the record, I believe there may be good explanations behind such phenomena, which go beyond ascribing them to alien intelligence.

Their was one leader and 3 trialing behind, almost in a triangular formation.  I am an avid sky watcher and always study aircrafts, I can't explain what these were...I am baffled.",

It was really twinkling, that is why I noticed it. I tried to ignore it, but curiosity got the best of me, so about 15 minutes later I went back outside to see what the \"star\" was doing...that is when I noticed the red and white flashing lights that were moving around the sky as if they were planes circling while waiting to land at the airport. The airports are too far away from where I was to have been the case. So I stood and watched while they decided to take a flight pattern to the north from south, as they did the night prior. The red and white lights never stopped and I could see them at least 30-40 miles away. Then they came back, just like the night before, but 2 of them went east while the other one stayed south.  My dog and I were on a walk earlier that evening and all of a sudden she got spooked, like I've never seen her ever do before. She just started walking as fast as she could looking and sniffing for something, but it was an aimless chase. She finally settled down about 5 or so minutes into the chase. When we got home she wouldn't go near the front door and that is her post day in and day out.  Like I said before...I am baffled and would love some answers.",

THe thing hovered over and then all the electrical devices in my house were fine. My camera was experiencing static but there was a light shade of a humanoid in the background of it in static like an old black in white tv having bad reception.

The UFO appeared at 21:33 left at 21:39 and then returned exactly one hour later and left exactly one hour after the last time it left. It was a triangle shaped craft with lights on the tips of the triangle. The lights were a mix of these colors, red, maroon, orange and yellow. The body of the craft was black. It came from the west and was moving east. It was large, it was bigger than any airplane or I had ever seen and it made a small humming noise. The size of the craft would have been he size of a baseball field. The craft was able to distort radio waves and cell phone frequencies. It caused a lot of static on radios and on my cell phone. There were chirping noises coming from my radio in the static. My cell phone had a lot of static. I was on the phone with a family member telling him about it and he may have seen it. It was able to mess with any electrical appliances that were left on. It had my watch on my hand going off the fritz. The second hand kept spinning forward and eventually stopped after it left. My camera even had static on it. I am mailing what I saw on the camera lcd screen. It looked like they were hailing me on my camera like on the show star trek. The weirdest part of the experience is the effect it had on my 5 cats. All five cats came into the room I was in. I even had one locked in my room and it opened the door to get out there. The cats circled me as I was gazing at the object. The object was slowly moving over my house and there was another flying object behind it and it was much smaller like a manmade aircraft chasing it. That aircraft did not make any sound and when it came close to the UFO it left for approximately one hour. I had sent in an earlier report and I mixed up the times by three hours. It happened at dark and the lights of the craft were the only things that could easily be seen. It was spinning clockwise the entire time and when it was hovering over the house. I tried to go outside but my cats would not let me. It came back an hour latter and the! same re sults with electrical devices were happening. I was on the phone with my girlfriend and it went static, I went out to the room and I saw the ufo coming from northwest going southwest towards my house it looked like it was going to collide and then it went invisible and the cats started hissing at something I could not even see in the room. There was a constant humming sound in the room until the cats hissed then it went away again and did not come back. This happened before in September 8 years ago on the 23. The same thing happened then. That was when I was 8 years old, half my life in the past. I think they were going to try and take me.",

I got the binoculars on it and it appeared simply as one of the brighter stars, in motion and with a constant glow. It repeated this twice, on the last \"illumination\" it came to a dead stop, increased in brightness @ 4X, remained at this maximum illumination for @ 2 seconds, and disappeared. That's it.  As I said, this object appeared as nothing more than a moving star, a rather common sighting of terrestrial origins. It was not moving exceptionally fast, it was the on/off of the \"light\" and it's finale that I found unusual.

In the middle of the lights was a bright blue that traversed across the sky in a Southwestern course. The orange lights were constant glowing like a campfire although it did not flicker.  It was very primative looking with a very dull glow to it.  They were individually points in what appeared to be in the shape of a stretched out hexagon, or a holly leaf.  They all seemed to be traveling at the same speed and in the same pattern, and same direction.  I estimate that they were 4-6 ft tall. The formation traveled between 75-100 ft off of the ground. I was traveling about 200 mph/322 kmh.  All together they would have stretched across 3 football fields.  I noticed I could see through it.  I was able to see things through the \u201cUFO\u201d as it crossed the sky I could watch a stars and a plane in the distance behind the object as it passed by.  As if it was not there at all except for the lights. The blue light was in the direct center.   This light was very precise and very \"high-tech\" looking like an LED light. This light would normally pass as a star, but it stayed in the same formation as the other lights, it traveled in the same direction, and stayed in the direct center.  It also seemed to be pulsating slowly. The only reason that this struck me as a possible \u201cUFO\u201d is that when the lights disappeared, they all dimmed at the same time.  They did not disappear one at a time, like it was going into a cloud bank. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

I looked north, when I observed a brilliant pink light which was at the very top of my drivers side window.  I had to put my head up against the window which was appox. 4 inches down to observe this light.  The color of this pink light startled me.  With no reference point (it was dark) it was hard to estimate the size and the height of this light in the air.  I slowed my truck down from 35mph to about 5mph to stop and get out and take a closer look.  As I justed about stopped, the pink light emitted sparks then disappeared.  The pink circular light was moving east to west almost directly above me, no sound was emitted either.  This lasted 6-8 seconds.",

On July 4th, 2009, myself and four other family members and friends were on our front porch watching fireworks coming from the next suburb East of us, approximately two or three miles away.  In the middle of the show, a bit past 21:15 we noticed a red, almost square shape high in the Northern sky above St. Louis county,  a somewhat higher altitude than airplanes that arrive into Lambert Airport, it continued to rise at a very quick pace faster than regular aircraft; a minute later in the direction of the fireworks display, the same size red square shaped craft  rose from the tree-line straight up at an unbelievable fast pace and then angled towards the other red square now hovering high in the sky. All of us on the porch witnessed it, at first a couple people thought the second one was a hot air balloon but within seconds of it rapidly rising faster into the atmosphere than even airplanes do that theory was discounted; it was clear it was not any type of balloon or regular aircraft, we lost visual contact of both crafts in the clouds as it had rained about 10 minutes prior.  Both were identical, almost square, and possibly slightly rectangular, with a very small light at one corner. Visual contact lasted about two minutes in duration.",

      "story": "Diamond shaped object in southern sky, have compelling video I saw a strange object in the southern sky on Sunday 5/10/09 at approximately 7:30 PM.  The flight was not consistent with any aircraft I'm familiar with.  It was slow and methodical, and in the distance.  It appeared to be 2000-4000 feet in altitude, approximately as large as a 2 story house, and appeared to change shape either by rotating or turning over somehow.  I also caught about 4 minutes of video tape; of which about 10-15 seconds are pretty compelling that what I saw is simply unexplained.  Here is a brief description of the events:  \tAt about 7:30 PM on 5/10/09 I had just finished cleaning up from a massive Mother's Day feast that I had prepared.  I stepped outside on my back porch for some fresh air, when I noticed a very small object in the sky.  I first thought it was a high flying plane at 50,000 feet which sometimes fly overhead.  Then I realized that it was overcast, and that I couldn't possibly see that high.  After reasoning about the cloud cover I thought the object to be around 2000-3000 feet high.  Since then I have learned that the cloud cover was at 7000-8000 that night, so the object was definitely under that ceiling.  My initial thoughts of 2000-3000 feet may be correct, but not for certain. Right after I realized that is was moving too slow for a normal aircraft at that altitude so I called for my girlfriend to come and take a look.  She thought it was odd as well, and I asked her to rush to get the video recorder.  We started shooting the object, and was initially very hard to get into focus as our zoom was at 35 xs and was in auto focus mode.  So if we moved just slightly, or caught the top of a tree, or had a bird fly right by it would keep auto focusing and then blur out the object. Once we fiddled through it for a minute or two, we got the hang of it, and were able to capture several distinctly different shapes not visible with the naked eye.  One was a diamond, one looked like a slightly elongated football, and one like a top with some sort of antennae protruding from the top half of the shape.  There was only one object, but was either turning or rotating to create these different shapes.  The video we have is shaky, showing the object to dart around, but in reality it was moving in a straight line, and our zoom at 35 xs and our shaky hand is the cause for the appeared erratic motion of flight. The flight of the object was in the southern sky headed due north.  As it came north, it seemed to drop in altitude.  Then it went 45 degrees NE, and then headed due east.  As it headed east it appeared to ascend. At various times it appeared to have some sort of halo or ring around the entire object; either from air displacement or something else.  It made no noise, and there were other aircraft in the sky that were farther away and closer that were making noise.  The whole event from start to finish lasted roughly 7-10 minutes, and we have roughly 4-5 minutes of video.  There are about 15 seconds of very compelling shots of an object that I've never seen before. I'm about as well versed in Military Aviation as a private citizen can be, as I'm fascinated with the Military Channel, the Discovery Channel, and the History Channel.  This was not a B2, a F117, F22, or an F35.  I have seen all of them on numerous shows, and I can't see how any of the shapes I saw on the video could be one of those aircraft. Lastly, after my story aired on some local news stations here in town, a gentleman contacted me via fax with some sketches he drew after a sighting with him and his girlfriend on June 20th 2007 at approximately at 7:50 PM.  When I saw the fax it was clear that the images were very similar though he didn\u2019t have a video or a picture.  I contacted him and he came to my office to hear my story.  When he showed up, we talked for a bit.  He seamed genuine in nature, and as he was telling me his story, I quickly realized the similarities to my event.  The object seemed to change shape on an axis, there were at times a blur or a ring around the object obscuring the air around the object, that it moved slowly and deliberately across the sky changing altitude, and that it matched no aircraft he had ever seen either in shape or flight characteristics.  He explained that when he called his girlfriend into the room to see the story on TV she immediately said, \u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201d  Although he saw most of the object with the naked eye, it was closer to him than for me, as I wouldn\u2019t have been able to decipher the shapes with my naked eye.  Only with the use of my camera with the zoom all the way at 35 xs was I able to clearly see the shape of the object.  In telling me his story, I could see he felt vindicated of sorts, and was very interested in seeing where this went.  He said with almost 99% certainty that we saw the same object... I can send a still picture, and I'm truly writing to see if we can get any type of explanation of what we saw, or if you could shed some light into where we could go for help.",

After checking the ISS flyovers of St.Louis, there are no orbital paths flying over here until June so it wasn't an ISS flyover or a satellite, because satellites always give off a reddish hue due to the infrared light reflected back off the earth.  Again it was a bright white object started out as a dim light then in the middle of path grew extremely bright as the ISS is and then slowly dimmed out with a speed about as fast as the ISS flyovers are from what I can reference.

He said it was just a helicopter.  45 minutes later as we were leaving when the cops came, all cars scattered, that's when my buddy said that things still there. As we were driving down the road it started to move near where we were.  As it got closer it was about a football field high.  The craft appeared to be like a square/triangle and big, about the height of a one level house.  The length of about 50 yards.  It had three blinking red lights on the side, a blinking red light at the top, and a big spot light in the front. As this description sounds like an airplane, it wasn't. The craft was swaying back and forth as to where you can see the reflection of the metallic looking bottom look square.  I have a video of it. I had three people in my car that were going crazy.  The craft made no noise.  We left the pack of cars (which normally we wouldn't do), we jumped on the highway to follow the craft.  We were driving parallel with the craft.  You could see it clear as day.  It started  to veer off over highway 70 toward Illinois. We got off at the Bellfontaine exit and made a right.  The object was on the western side of us starting to travel quickly and we were following it for about 3 miles, then the object disappeared.  All four of us were freaking out cause this was no  aircraft that we have ever seen before.  The object had no propeller, no wings, made no noise, and had a square shape to it.

I was just sitting in a parking lot talking to a friend and noticed a black line in the sky.  We were on S.Kingshighway about a mile north of Chippewa.  It was very small and I could barely see it but my friend saw it as well.  It never moved.  Not one time.   There were clouds, black and white, moving behind it at a slow speed.  But the shape never moved.  It stayed there for a long time.  I thought it must be a weather balloon.  However, it never moved.  As I said, the clouds were moving but the black shape never moved.  It appeared very small, since it must have been below the clouds in the atmosphere.  It was tall and skinny.  I watched it for about 30 minutes.  I did take a picture with my cell phone, however it was so tiny, I don't believe it showed up. I moved to another location about 100 yards away and could still see it.  I finally had to go, but I couldn't find it again when I got home.  It freaked me out a bit, so I started looking on the news sites and didn't find anything about it.  Dont' know... just felt I should tell someone.",

I often run at night on this track and almost always see aircraft heading toward the airport during my run.  I am familiar with the typical flight path of planes on their way to Lambert.  What I saw tonight was a clear outline/silhouette of the wings of what looked like a typical jet headed for landing but it was lower (in altitude) and was traveling a little faster than the planes I usually see when running at this track.  I could make out the wings quite clearly but the tail and nose (assuming they were there) of the craft were less clear.  There were absolutely NO lights whatsoever - just a silhouette against the dark sky.  It moved just like a regular jet but there was absolutely no sound.  I had just seen a jet go by on! the same path about 5 minutes or so prior to this sighting.  After reporting by phone to NUFORC, I called Lambert Airport police/security and they transferred me to someone named John in \"Ops\" (couldn't clearly hear what John said when he answered). I told John what I had seen (jet with no lights/no sound headed toward Lambert) and he said they'd had no reports of anything unusual tonight.  I will also mention that Boeing has a large facility right next to Lambert Airport - perhaps some kind of test plane?",

      "story": "6 lights spanning across the street , a triangle shaped object hovering and spinning, silent I was coming home from spending Christmas eve with family.  As I was driving down my street to my house, I saw 6 orange lights in the sky.  I was thinking at first they were Christmas lights someone had figured out how string high up in the sky across the street, but realized they were too high to be hung using the telephone poles.  My next thought was that they were strung somehow using the church steeple on one side; but couldn't figure out what was holding them up on the other side of the street.  I parked my truck, walked to the top of the driveway. I was planning on walking down to the church (1 block down) to see how they had strung the light across the street.  When I got to the top of my driveway, only 3 lights were left in the sky.  Not only that, but they were no longer crossing the street, they were now hovering over the homes one block up to the left.  I walked a couple houses up to get a better look. I realized the lights were forming a triangle! shaped object.  Then I realized I could acutally see the object against the dark sky.  It was a long, thin triangle about the size of the block it was hovering over.  It was also completley silent.  It was hovering and then began a lazy spin.  The tip of the triangle was spinning away from me.  I saw the two base corner lights.  The right base light faded, then the left base light.  It seemed to take a long time for the left base light to fade out.  When I realized there was an actual triangle shaped object hovering over the block of homes, I also realized that I must have first seen two triangle objects over the street.  I also realized that this meant the tips of the triangles were in the middle of the street, the bases on either side.  That is the only way to describe the lights I saw across the street.  Two vertical from each other on either side and two in the middle of the street.  I looked around to see if there was anyone else in the street who might have seen this! as well, and of course, there wasn't.  Neither did a car pass! by duri ng this time.  The area where I saw the triangle hovering is a quiet block of homes, however, the street they face is a pretty busy local street.  I would be surprised if I was the only one who saw this.  I'm going to listen to the 10:00 news to see if anyone else reported this, but that's probably futile.  I also know there are two airfields in the immediate area. One is Lambert Airfield, the other is Scott AirForce base.  I do remember a few years ago (8 or so maybe?) there was a report of a UFO that made the news on the Illinois side of the river.  I cannot identify what I saw, but I know I saw something I've never seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

I was at the headquarters on Lindbergh, just south of the 64/40 highway. No other person was in the parking lot at that moment. The sky to my eyes was cloudy, with some gaps containing haze.  I saw an object moving in the north/northeast sky, moving north/northwest for about 1-2 seconds.  The speed was greater than a conventional airplane.   The object caught my attention because of its size, which appeared to be the size of a significant fraction of the moon if that had been visible, about a 1/3 visible moon size.  Most striking was the bluish green color, not a deep strong color but more of a shade of white.   The object emerged from a cloud, passed through I believe some haze because the outline was not sharply distinct, and was gone into another cloud.  I did not hear any sound.   I have not heard any mention on the local radio.  I realize this could have been a meteor just before impact, but it sure looked totally different from any \"shooting star\" I ever have seen before.

I have never seen anything like it.  I am still stunned. I called a few of the businesses located at this intersection and asked if maybe they had some sort of floating lights/ lanterns as a promotion (I was thinking red for the Cardinals), but none of the people at these locations said they had lights like this and they hadn\u2019t seen anything.  I know I sounded completely crazy calling them, but I am very intrigued by what I saw!   I consider myself a professional person. I have a college education.

Black cylinder in bright daylight  I was traveling back to Kansas City on a Southwest flight during the middle of the day.  The sun was at full shine with no cloud coverage at top average airline altitude.  I looked out the window as I often do on flights and saw this black cylinder shaped object flying within reaching distance to the airline window.  This black cylinder had a semi-sphere head that resembled a basic security camera gloss, possibly made out of glass.  This object was no bigger than half the size of my forearm in both length and width.  As I was watching it fly just a bit faster than average airline speed covering an extra foot every 2 seconds, I had no quick access to a camera or possibly alerting another individual fast enough before it was gone. I have no evidence of this event as far as other witnesses or footage.  This object was seen years ago and I only have my word to back this claim.  I will say knowing I was lacking witnesses and camera footage, I kept telling myself to fully memorize the moment.  I didn\u2019t take my eye off of it for a second and studied every visible thing I could.  This object was also in no way attached to the airline, but clearly had the confidence of flying so close on the brightest of days.

Something caught my eye to the right and I focused on what it was. It appeared to be two black objects flying in a circular pattern, almost parallel to each other. It wasn\u2019t birds, it wasn\u2019t clouds and it wasn\u2019t just something caught in the wind. At least one of them I could tell had a definitive disk shape. It was hard to keep a steady view of the objects because they were flying through the low lying storm clouds. Just before they disappeared completely from view, one of them peaked directly through the clouds and it was then I could see the disc shape. I did not notice any lights, I did not notice any type of rotation of the objects, only that they were flying in a circular pattern. Their movement wa! s fast, about the speed of a helicopter circling an area. It definitely was not something natural.

      "story": "St. Louis, Missouri - June 4, 2013: Spheroid object executes vertical climb to 25,000 ft. in less than 3 minutes On Tuesday, June 4, 2013, at approximately 1:30pm, I was sitting in my car in the parking lot of  a St. Louis fast food restaurant for lunch located on Oakland Blvd. just east of Hampton Ave. and south of Interstate 64 and something to the northwest of me caught my eye. Looking through the windshield, I saw something move rapidly in a circular motion and it vanished quickly.  As a result, I thought I was looking at a remote control model airplane or a bird.  The object was very dark against a fairly bright sky, below a scattered overcast. The object appeared to be very low over the distance treetops when in view, but momentarily vanished and I thought it went down below the tree line or the horizon.  I could not determine how far the object was laterally, from my position.  There was nothing behind it that it crossed to get a distance estimate. I looked down to my sandwich and when I looked back up to the same location, (which was to my northwest), I saw an object, roughly spherical in shape, very dark, which began an immediate vertical ascent. What put me into a sudden \"What the hell\" moment was that the object was moving straight up and pretty fast.  I leaned down toward the dash and crooked my neck to watch the sphere continue its vertical ascent as it kept going until it reached what appeared to be the cloud base (the cloud ceiling). At that moment, the object then stopped moving and held stationary at the cloud base.  It remained stationary for approximately 2 minutes.  It could have been moving slowly to the right, or perhaps the clouds were moving slowly to the left, but after about two minutes, the object merged into the cloud above it and became obscured. At its highest observed altitude (as it moved into the cloud), the object could be distinguished as a spherical shape, a black dot at this point. As I observed the object , I was so captivated by what I was seeing that I failed to do a simple time count as it ascended; but the total time from near ground level to the cloud base at 25,000 ft. was not more than 3 minutes maximum, but could have been as little as 30 seconds. Following the event, I placed phone calls to the nearby Forest Park administrative office as well as a local university's science departments and inquired if any kind of balloon had been launched. All inquiries came of negative. I inquired into how to find the accurate cloud ceiling for the date and time of the sighting and was referred to the National Weather Service where I found the Three Day Weather records and June 4, 2013, data established the cloud ceiling at OVC250, which means overcast at 25,000 Feet, and that matched what I observed. Using a speed and time calculator, I found the following possible indicated speeds of the object.  The following speeds are based on three estimated times for the object to travel from near ground level to 25,000 feet. 30 seconds, 1, 2, and 3 minutes. 3 Minutes: 94.69 MPH  2 Minutes: 142.04 MPH  1 Minute: 284.09 MPH 30 Seconds: 568.18 MPH   Having seen a variety of balloons in the air, I\u2019ve never seen a balloon ascend at these rates of speed, and although I cannot state exactly \u201cwhat\u201d this object was, it must have possessed considerable size because I was able to observe the object at the cloud ceiling, or 25,000 feet. If anyone else in the St. Louis area observed this object on June 4, 2013, I would very much like to see additional details.

I stepped out onto my back deck, (evening of Saturday, September 14th) started to sit down on a chair but looked up before doing so.  Coming from the direction of the southeast there is a bright orange round object moving over my house. Higher then a helicopter but much closer then an airplane.  It is bright orange on the outside/underside but a deeper orange in the center.  The color in the center seemed to be moving but that might have something to do with the atmosphere.   I stepped into the house and the clock reads 9:40 pm.  About 30 seconds later a second one appears coming from the same direction, displaying the same thing as the first.  About 30 seconds after that another orange one goes over my house but still at a level that I could see the darker orange moving around inside the center.  All three objects move out of sight into the northwest sky.  I went back outside and have been watching but I do not think any more will come tonight. I am not very good at trying to judge size and distance but they were close and big enough that I could see the variance of the orange colors inside the spheres/UNDERSIDE.  I believe if I would stretch out my arm, the objects would be about the size of the palm of my hand.  This is the first time I have seen anything like this.  I did have trouble sleeping; I kept seeing images of them in my mind all night long.  All I can say is, it might be explained away but I can see the stars in the sky, so it is a clear night.  There are no other lights like an airplane would have and they were completely SILENT but moved at about the same speed as an airplane would travel.",

I was watching tv when I heard a engine noise that sounded like a muffled airplane engine, different then anything I have heard. I go to the back door and look and I see a bright Orange light like planet Mars in color, but brighter, I thought at first it looked like a satellite but moving much slower than one,   Also I notice there was a hazy sky and the object appeared lower than the hazy clouds. And there was a full moon.  I call my wife and say check out this light in the sky, she looks out and says what the hell is that, I don't know I grab my binoculars, I have two pairs my good pair is 25x100 I use for astronomy.  Even in the binocs I cant see any detail, just a Orange light, no flashing lights, no outline of a typical aircraft at night.   Too think it passed directly overhead of my home, with the engine noise I know it wasn't a satellite and with no flashing lights it wasn't a plane or helicopter.  We live on a hill and watched it for almost ten minutes, slow moving, steady heading south in a straight line, then when it was a good two miles away it turned red my wife yelled to me did you see it just change color I said yes,. I can't believe we are watching this thing. We watched it for about 10 min before it disappeard off the horizon. We can see about 6 miles with our hilltop view.  I thought maybe its a drone of some kind so the next day I reported it to the police and they said they have no drones in the county so they tell me to report it to the FAA. I called and they say they don't know of any drones operating in Missouri at all. I don't know if they are telling the truth or not. All we know it wasn't any normal aircraft we have ever seen.",

      "story": "Diamond Shaped Object with Three Distinct Circles over Saint Louis, MO during Geminid Meteor Shower Six of my friends, and myself stayed up late to watch the Geminid Meteor Shower.  Three of them are in my Masters program in Athletic Training at Saint Louis University;  Two were my neighbors, and one was my fiance.   Four of us, me and my 3 classmates, were laying on the concrete saw the object flying North to South.  I pointed to it the same time a second person next to me saw the object.  Two others on the concrete saw it as well, making it four observers, including myself (all in my Masters program).  It had no lights.  It did, however, have 3 visible circles in a triangular pattern, and a faint fourth circle in the back, making a diamond shape.  The circles looked like, what I would describe, a suction cup.  They were dark on the edges, become lighter towards the center, and were darkest in the center.  It gave the appearance like these circles, we were seeing were cone-like, and we were seeing them from below the cone, from wide end to the tip. What could be seen on the object was only due to the reflection of the city.  It was flying at a medium speed at a lower level from North to South.  It left no trail behind the object.  There was also no sound. We had it in view for about 45 seconds.  I'm assuming it was a lower level because of the reflection of the city lights off its exterior.  What I found most intriguing was that there were no lights on the object as a plane would have on its wings.  There were no red or white lights. The only colors we could make out were shades of gray.  There was only one object.   We tried to get the other three people with us to see the objects, so we stood up, and pointed at it.  However, we lost it in the street lights as our eyes adjusted to the lights.  As we went upstairs, I drew a picture of the object and asked the others if it was what they saw.  All three observers exclaimed, \"YES! That's EXACTLY it!\"  We did not feel threatened by it. It is important to note that each of us had had two drinks each, but were under the legal limit to drive safely.",

It first appeared to be a very bright star, like a planet, flickering and low towards the horizon.  Looking ahead it was a immediate eye catch. About a minute later I could tell it was local and moving, we were heading towards each other.  The light then in my mind resembled a landing gear light on a plane.  I could tell it was flying very low.  There is a airport in it's direction about 7 miles away, way too low for that distance, about 500-700 ft. I reached Hwy 40 and when I was close to the interchange to go west it was just reaching hwy 40 from the south side, on a path heading north still just west of the interchange.  I then noticed three additional lights, red, green and blue in a triangle pattern, red leading.  The moment I realized this object was unusual was when I realized the marker lights were not blinking, no tail light, the bright white light was in the middle of the craft, not shining in just the forward direction but in every direction. By this time I was on the ramp for 40 west.  The craft just crossed hwy 40. With the height seeming to be 500-700 ft or about a little higher than a cell tower, I could not make a outline of the craft.  Just the four lights.  Heading towards the side of it getting on 40 it seemed to be moving very slowly at this point and by time I was passing it's path behind it it seemed to have rapidly picked up speed and changed direction to northwest. Now when telling the very same people I talk to everyday, including my wife, immediately there's a look like uh huh yeah right.  So with that in mind... when I was on the on ramp for hwy 40 and I was heading towards the side of the craft, I saw what appeared to be a small rectangular door opening.  It was behind the middle white light and off centered.  I took it as a door because the dim glow grew as such from a door opening.  I could not make any details out from what was inside just that the dim glow was indirect.  I don't tell anyone anymore but figured I should atleast report it. I was captivated at first as much as anyone is by a low flying plane but when realizing something is different about what I was seeing, I didn't want to pull over, fumble with my phone for a pic... all I wanted to do was observe and figure it out.

As we watched closer, we noticed that unlike helium balloons, these objects were not gaining altitude.  They appeared to be hovering and slightly moving southward in the sky.  I would estimate that there were at least 50 small silver spherical objects. \tAs we stared at them, they faded in and out as if the sun was reflecting off and on.  The sky was clear, so there was no obvious reason for this discrepancy in reflection.  As they faded in and out, they seemed to make new formations.  To me, the fading in and out was like a star that you can only see through peripheral vision, but not when looking straight at it.  This incident occurred for 10 or 15 minutes.  They were still in the sky as we were leaving the school.  Numerous others saw the objects in the sky.  One person commented that it was behaving like a school of fish in the sky.",

I walked over to the edge of our yard afterwards and checked out their yard for a bit.  No one was out there, no bon fire, nothing.  Was excited I got to see it.  Unsure where it went.  Previously at around the age of 10 or so (1992) witnessed a white glowing orb 1 foot in diameter.  It \"pulled up\" to my passenger side window as we were driving down the highway and it followed along side us for a few moments.  This was on highway 44 near where the old gas reservoirs used to be near Maplewood and Shrewsberry.  My mother was driving and also witnessed it.",

So I started watching them instead of the play, just for a about 4 minutes.  Then they all disappeared right before my eyes, simultaneous all at the same time.   I thought that maybe there was a cloud.  So I waited to see if they would reappear, they did not.   And the sky was pretty clear, with some wind and a few clouds. I know that in the constellations there are Summer and Winter star triangles.  I told my husband and he said that it was the Summer Triangle.  Why would they all disappear at the same time and not return.  I looked for them later and did not see them again.

Both have been reported on your site and witnessed by me. ----- Original Message -----  From: Neighbor To:  Me  Sent: Monday, June 16, 2014. 10:27 PM  Subject: Orange Glow Thing  I just saw the orange in the sky. Not perfectly round but shaped like a hot air balloon.  Also seemed to have flame at one end like a balloon. It wasn't too high up in the air like a plane but it went over your house from south to north.  It was moving pretty fast.  By the time i went in to get binoculars by back door I couldn't find it but there are a lot of trees in the way. What is it? It's a real object. I think it's a balloon of some sort.  Went overhead about 10:15 tonite.  I don't think it was high enough for a weather balloon.  It was moving fast and straight like it was being controlled and had power of its own. If you find out or have any ideas let me know.  \u2026..MY RESPONSE TO THE E-MAIL\u2026.. Thank you sooo much for this.  Finally someone else has seen it.  Since you are right in back of me, it should always be visible to you as well.  No matter what time of the night, if you see it again, PLEASE call me.  Again, thank you.

My neighbor moved out of her house yesterday so I was curious to see if there were any lights on in the back of the house which would indicate that the new neighbors were there.  (It was between 10:33 and 10:35 PM).   I look up and passing over my house there is a bright round orange orb/light.  This night is cloudy so perhaps the object was distorted?  BUT as crazy as this might sound, it looked like it had something attached to the backside of it (as I viewed it going past my line of vision).  The something looks like an orange transparent sack/bubble; like the UFO/ORB was pulling or dragging it.   I ran inside the house to call my kids but decided it was too late THEN went back outside only to see another one passing over my house.  This time I did call my daughter-in-law on the cordless phone.  She went outside but was not able to see it.  The first one to pass over my house looked like something was attached but the second one did not.  Both are a glowing orange.  The first one was so bright I thought it was going to crash and that the appendage was actually fire.  Apparently, I was wrong since I watched it move out view.    Both were silent and moved at the same speed as an airplane.  I would say they were airplanes distorted by cloud coverage BUT they were such a bright burning orange, completely silent and with orange being the only visible color...  There might have been one before I stepped outside but missed it.  Tonight their direction went from WEST to EAST (both of them).",

The objects were equidistant away from each other moving at a steady pace right overhead, about the height of a plane coming in for a landing, but kept their pattern true.  The objects slowly \"faded out\" at about the same spot in the sky.   A minute or two later, 5 or 6 more \"fiery objects\" came moving in, almost same straight pattern, but slightly askew.  There was no noise from these objects.  They just kept there course.

Black discoid object flying from E to W, observed early afternoon from residential roof top during clear sky over north side St. Louis city, Mo.  No wings, no lights, just steady trajectory across sky until out of view over western horizon.  There were many local black birds in the windy sky directly over neighborhood, but none at ufo's altitude.   It wasn't moving at extreme speed, but should've at least been traveling a few hundred mph due to the lack of time it took to cross the entire visible sky over head.  It was gone in at least 10 seconds after gracefully soaring right across the open sky.   I thought it was a big black bird (or hawk possibly) sailing a high wind current at first, but as I watched without distraction it never exposed any wings or showed any obvious biological identifiers or movements.  From my visual perspective, the ufo flew in a straight line at a steady speed.  I was not a gigantic object, but couldn't have been any smaller than a car.  No identifying marking or designs, at least from my distance.   While watching I tapped on window to attract my nephew, but he had just left the house.  My wife came by, but didn't come on roof as she was preoccupied and I still wasn't sure what I was witnessing.   I reluctantly did not pull my cell phone out quick enough to access the camera once I realized i was witnessing an anomaly.  As soon as it disappeared over the western horizon, I went back inside + informed my wife why I had nocked on the window.   This is the 2nd sighting I have witness from my roof which technically is the 4th floor of our house + permits an awesome view over the surrounding neighborhoods and metro city downtown. *My 1st sighting from this location was at night, a glowing orb like ship appeared (ironically) over the western horizon from behind some clouds heading west and then redirected its corse into a sharp decent down to earth and out of view.  That account took place about 2 years ago, the same week my step son took pictures of an entire mass fleet of glowing orb like ufos moving out across the night sky from an unknown location he witnessed with many other residents at his fathers previous apt complex way out in O'fallon, Mo.  We still have the picture he took with his cellphone.  There were no other airplanes in sky, as usually there are as we are under the direct path all airplanes take to taxi Lambert Airport.  The ship also did not glow or perform any other apparent actions/activities. These accounts are  astonishing even if they are all just drones or black military vehicles.  They are apparently becoming more obvious publicly. I am an US military veteran.  As a child I studied all kinds of jets, vehicles + technologies into my adult life.  In the field of creative arts I have also studied much structure, anatomy and behaviors of many things.  I am extremely positive I have witnessed these specific anomalies + anticipate more disclosure +/or public observations.  Hopefully, I could not have been the only one who witnessed this last event.  You never see this stuff over the city, ever.  I've been waiting to see them for myself a long time, but am not convinced these are directly alien, even though I do not rule out the possibility due to all cultural histories.",

(Basically drew a big square in the sky and was gone in under 2 seconds.)  I say it was a \"star\" because it was the same light and intensity of the other easily seen stars.

I went to the very top of our 6 story car garage to look for a car.  Out the corner of my eye, I saw a very large craft flying very low & slow traveling north over highway 270 which is less than a mile from the garage I was at.   As I took a double take at this craft, I realized that this was not a airplane i was seeing.  The craft was jet black it seemed only the top was reflective to the sun the sides of the craft was not reflecting from the sun on a bright sunny day which was odd.  The craft was also oddly shaped the center seemed to be flat almost disk like but the front and rear seemed to be rounded.   The craft was completely silent it did not admit any noise I could hear.  I have heard many airplanes fly over that parking garage from much further distances.  This craft I seen was the closest I have ever seen a craft near that garage so it should have been very loud and yet the only noise I could hear was cars on the highway.  This craft looked to be possibly bigger than a 757.   I took screenshots of the video that I took and zoomed In the pictures and some people I showed this to thought it was a Chinook helicopter but there is no way it was in my opinion for the fact a Chinook is very loud and what I was seeing was silent.  I am just looking for answers of what this was it could be military, or could be unknown.. Thanks, ((name deleted))",

It was moving across the sky quietly, then another appeared farther to the right.  It looked the same as the first triangle one, but instead of silence it as loud like a jet.

There was no visible points of engines exhausts.  It was dark in color, not smooth in shape, with unknown markings, and what appeared to be closed areas that may have been entry points.

I initially thought that the orbs were the lights of an aircraft, but I did not see the flashing red usually located beneath commercial aircraft.   As I proceeded to drive down the road, I had stopped at a stoplight.  At the stop, the orbs became obstructed from my view for less than 30 seconds, but during the seconds the orbs disappeared.   There is a field along the road past the stoplight that provides an unobstructed view of the sky.  I looked around for the orbs or any aircraft that could be the cause of the sighting, but I saw nothing in the sky.",

UFO Report filed 06/16/17:    On 06/15/17, at 9:05 pm, standing on our deck preparing to barbeque, I saw a light in southeastern sky that was moving toward my position gradually.  I noticed that it looked different from an aircraft (we live south of St. Louis airport so airplanes are common and frequent) and had an orange/red glow much like a flame so my first guess was that it could be a hot air balloon.   As it got closer, I tried to listen for the familiar sound of gas burners but was surprised at its total silence.  It soon lost the light and moved to more of a north course as a very dim sphere.  It seemed to speed up and soon was beyond the trees on our horizon to the north.   The entire siting lasted approximately 10 minutes.   Upon reflection, I don\u2019t recall ever seeing a hot air balloon past sunset and never saw one move so fast.   Also, I could not discern a fast wind to propel a balloon.

I looked up into the sky and noticed 3 bright white lights in a \"V\" shape off to the SE.  From my perspective, I would prognosticate that they were about 2-3 miles away.  At first, it looked only moderately out of the ordinary and no sound was heard.  About 30 seconds later the lights flashed a very bright pulsating red strobe light which last for about 5 seconds.  I did not have my phone, so I ran to my apartment which was only 30 feet from my location at the time.  I grabbed my phone and ran back outside.  Upon return, the lights had traversed a significant distance South (estimate 15-20 miles) and maintained that distance for 1 hour.  I did take pictures and video, however the lights were too far to render any valuable imagery.  I continued to watch the lights hover and no additional strobe lights were observed.  During this time a total of 5 white lights could be seen in a linear pattern and would turn on and o! ff intermittently.  At 0530, the lights dissipated and were no longer visible.  No other individuals in the area were present to my knowledge.",

At that point it shot up into the sky, there was a white flash, and it was gone. The entire incident lasted 3 minutes. The prior morning , I had been driving East on I44, and I saw what seemed like \"erratic flares\" over the highway not far from my sighting.  Probably 4-5 of them.  One of them went over the highway and seemed to have landed in the Soccer field on left side of highway.  At the time I didn't pay close attention, but believe they were related.",
