      "story": "Unidentified Light - Color Changing and Flashing,  Very Fast and Maneuverable beyond anything I've Seen - Plano, TX At approximately 9:40PM on 05/21/2019, I observed a very unusual light, while looking north from my Apartment Complex in East Plano, TX.  To provide background, to the north of my apartment is a major thoroughfare of Aircraft flying West toward DFW Airport and Love Field in Dallas, TX.  I often smoke outside in the evenings and have seen all types of crafts, usually easily determining that they are Commercial Aircraft.  On THIS occasion, the light was different. First, the light was White and moved about half-way across the entire horizon from East to West.  It moved at a MUCH higher rate of speed than any plane.  There were planes in the distance to compare to.  Suddenly, it Stopped.  No slowing, as if a plane was turning\u2026 it just Stopped.  It proceeded to move directly Upward at a high rate of speed, and then back Downward at a slower rate.  This is definitely not any maneuver that can be performed by modern aircraft.  It was also quite a distance away.  My guess would be 10+ Miles North of me, possibly near McKinney, TX, but it is hard to determine . The light was Solid White to begin with, then began to flash, and then turned a solid Red.  The flashing was Extremely Bright for something that far away. I ran inside to get my Cell Phone to record the light.  When I came back out, the light was still there, and came above the horizon (so, it couldn\u2019t be a drone\u2026 too far away.)  It continued to flash and then moved directly Upward.  It then moved to the East toward an Airplane that was flying East to West.  It seemed to mirror the speed of the plane, but was lower on the horizon.  Again it stopped.  The color changed to a Red from White, and it dimmed by a large amount.  The Light then became bright again and moved back to the West.  I continued to watch the light until it went below the Horizon. I see planes flying in this sky on a DAILY basis\u2026 and always keep an eye out for anything weird\u2026 this is the FIRST TIME I have ever seen anything like this.  I don\u2019t know WHAT is was, but the movements were not something I had ever witnessed, nor do I believe that the maneuvers could have been completed by any craft with our technology. I DID video what I could, but my footage is grainy, and I\u2019m not a good Camera-Man.  I do narrate what I am seeing.

      "story": "Multiple strange hovering lights seen in the night sky over Plano and Allen, Tx. My girlfriend and I were driving home from a local eatery at approximately 10:30 PM on August 16th 2007. The eatery is located on Preston Rd just south of George Bush Tollway. The route we took was to head north on Preston Rd and enter onto George Bush Tollway heading east. As we continued this way and reached the vicinity of Coit Rd to Custer Rd we witnessed three strange looking lights in the sky northeast of our location. We first thought maybe they are lights attached to a pole for construction work purposes, but as we approached closer we realized they were higher in the air, but not as high as you might expect a plane to be travelling. We then thought they were low flying planes, but the lights appeared to be brighter than what i'm used to seeing and they did not appear to be moving. We continued to monitor the crafts as we transitioned from George Bush Tollway onto I75 heading north and noticed that there were more than just the original three crafts. As we made the change to I75 there were now 3 to the west, 3 to the east, 3-4 to the north, and 3 to the south as we traveled through Plano. On approach to the city of Allen, Texas we then observed 3 more in the distance to the north and 1 to the northeast. They all appeared to have lights like a plane would have ( red, blue flashing lights with a headlight), but the light seemed to always be facing us even as we changed directions and as mentioned before, they did not appear to be moving. Shortly after we arrived at our home in Allen, Texas I proceeded outside with my binoculars, but was unable to observe anything unusual within the airspace I was able to capture. My viewing space was limited due to homes and trees blocking most of my view. Was there some military action or police action? If so, then why was it not aired on the news? Was there excessive air traffic because of the Erin storm front? Again, why was it not on the news? I was not under the influence of any alcohol or mind altering drugs. I have no history of psychologica! l proble ms and was not excessively tired or drowsy. I have never seen anything like this in my life and have lived in the Dallas area for the large majority of it.

I guesstimate its altitude between 2000-3000 feet flying faster than the usual commercial air traffic. The craft had a grayish translucent color (like a jelly-fish), but was still clearly visible. It made absolutely no sound whatsoever. Its size in the sky was approximately 1.5-2\" held out at arm's length. The entire sighting lasted only 5-10 seconds before it was out of sight.  While this was not the most impressive UFO sighting I have had--I have had several UFO sightings over the past 40+ years--this was a first for my wife who, needless to say, was very excited at having finally seen one.",

It had an extremely brigght strobing light and it appeared to be silver against the night sky. The strange thing i noticed was that the object had no sound. We stopped for a moment when i noyiced what appeared to be an airforce jet below it. The jet was obviously examining the object. As we pulled into the driveway, I ran to the front of the house just in time to see the object shoot up into the clouds with a streak of red and green light as if in a sci-fi movie and the airforce jet attempt to follow it.

I don't know the constellation name but in the NNE sky I could see the triangle - 3 stars - and noticed a fourth and was surprised to see a fourth star?!  At about 10-15 degrees my daughter and I spotted an object that seemed closer to us than the stars. I would say perspectively it looked like it was about 15 miles from us. We looked around to see the airplane flight paths and watched that for about 2 minutes and decided it was not the same as an airplane.   We did not see this object move in any direction but we did see red flashing lights going around it in pattern almost.  The lights spinning around this object would speed up and then slow down.  We watched this thing for about 8-10 minutes and after the last cycle of flashing around this object it rapidly strobed may 6 or so times and it was gone.  About 30 seconds later we saw a dull white streak across the sky in a northerly direction and spotted another object in the North sky but it was glowing bluish somewhat hazy.  Just as the first object, it just disappeared after watching it for nearly 5 minutes.  About 2 or 3 minutes later, we spotted what looked like a military fighter jet flying in the direction we witnessed the first object - we could tell it was not a commercial jet because of it's profile.  It was flying fairly low - at least low enough for us to see the shape of the aircraft.  It is not common for military jets to fly over our house though there are several bases around us.  My daughter did attempt taking pictures of this second object, however, I'm not sure if that is what was captured. I can forward upon request.  We don't know what it was and we are hoping we weren't the only ones who witnessed this.",

I'm driving home from work east on 15th street approaching Independence Pkwy. when I notice a strange contrail in the sky. It was strange because it had a rapid and sharp direction change. It seemed to be originally travelling SouthWest and immediately transitioned to a straight up direction. I don't believe it was an optical illusion as far as the angle of observation is concerned. I DO HAVE PICTURES TO BACK UP MY STORY. I'm not an expert on contrails, but I have never observed one with such a sharp angle before. It seems to me that the G-forces would not be too forgiving on the occupants inside of the craft. I did see the craft travelling at the upward angle, but could not make out a shape and becuase it was daylight, I could not see any lights. The pictures were taken using my Motorola V360 camera phone and so are not the best photos, but you can clearly see the sharp angle. Any info on what vehicle could complete this type of maneuver would greatly be appreciated.",

As they continued moving south, the first light that became bright started to dim and disappeared completely, followed by the second light becoming dim and disappearing too.

We exited the turnpike at Custer Road, and proceeded to do a U-turn to head South on Custer Road in the direction of the lights. By the time we had turned around (approximately 30 seconds) the object appeared noticeably close and the lights appeared to have changed formation.  The object was now moving towards us rapidly, and the lights had changed to be almost on top of one another, the largest or closest at the top. The object moved very quickly from South to North-Northwest, passing almost directly overhead and slightly in front of our car. The object appeared now as a long, dark, pencil shaped dark against the night sky, with 3 lights evenly spaced along it, one at each end, and one directly in the center.

Next it started darting up and down at unbelievable speeds and darting extreme straight right and left as it was lowered and raised again. Then it disappeared underneath the tree line.

Three years ago I have seen orange basket balls size balls  of fire spew across the sky within several feet from me in Alvarado TX while visiting my family.  We all saw the balls of fire and hope some day to get a maginet on a stick and try to find them where they land in a field near a creek.",

I was inside my home, and on the phone in the kitchen when I looked out my kitchen window and noticed a disc flying over the trees a few blocks away.  At first I thought it may have been a mylar balloon, but soon realized that was not so.  It glided gently over the tree tops to my left slowly. I told the neighbor who I was on the phone with, to go outside, and see what I was seeing as it was soon to pass over our street; \"Raintree\". She met me outside with our children, her two girls and my son, all young. We all watched as the disc crossed over our street a few blocks away and soon hovered in the air for a few minutes. It was amazing.  Then, slowly, slowly it went straight up. Very slowly, until it looked as small as a star in the day sky, which was bright, brilliant sky blue, with no clouds.  We watched it there for many minutes, and then it went back in the direction it had originally come from . Small as a star at that time. I called the naval air base an! d reported it.  They asked me questions. They agreed I had seen , we had seen a real ufo. It had no seams in the silver looking metal, I could see no windows. It made no sound, and I was not in a position to see a shadow.  That is the truth. The whole truth and not hing but the truth. So, help me God!!!!",

As I was walking I noticed a very large shape in the sky, it was masked by the sky itself and the form could be made out only by the way the clouds where hugging around it. The shape never moved but the clouds did. It was large enough for me to question what I was seeing, so I decided to pull out my phone and take a couple of pictures. As I aimed the lens on my phone my vision closed to a black out, like I was fainting. I tried to shake out of it, and it seemed like a quick head rush and continued on my way, snapping other pictures as I went ( not of the sky though) in fact I never even looked back up ( very weird for me).

I looked up into the sky looking east and noticed a tiny pulsing REDish Gold spec of light in the air.  It was moving northward very slowly. The object was about the size of a head of a pin seen at arms length. I observed for about 5 minutes.  It stopped moving and stayed in a stationary position..  I said to myself that i am going to go to my car to get my digital canon camera.  And i did. When i got back it was hard to relocate the object at first but i finally was able.  It was sitting there for another 4 minutes and then slowly moved off to the north... Minutes later, I noticed another Goldish red orb in another area in the sky.  Basically overhead but  just a few degrees off to the south from just overhead...  It was larger  or lower and perhaps at the cirrus cloud height.  I took a few pictures with my canon camera..   Again it was still broad daylight and it almost seemed to glisten in a red gold type of light..  It was not close enough to tell if it was actually metallic or if it was a light.  I decided for some strange reason to turn the flash on the camera to on..  When I did that and took a photo.  The object that was standing stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes rapidly accelerated toward the southwest..   And then accelerated again and vanished. It was a two stage acceleration, going from still to rapid speed m then suddenly accelerates again to super fast and it was gone. When looking at the photo that I took,  and after I enlarged it,  looks  like all those other photos that you would see of UFOs in the national enquirer, and I laughed to myself.. To the naked eye it was more visible and did not represent any known aircraft.  It was neither a bird nor a balloon.  I did not know of any bird or balloon that will accelerate the way this thing did, or stay stationary they it did while being watched in the North Texas sky.. Photo to be sent in Email",

I looked up to see a V-shaped object that was silently gliding fairly slowly across the sky. It went out of my view so I changed locations only to see it make a large circle and then head back north. It was in sight for approximately 30 seconds then moved out of view completely and about that time a smaller object of the same shape and opacity shot from the south heading north behind it. At first I thought it looked like a flock of birds then realized that it was too perfect and when it circled around I got a better view. There were no lights and no sound. The objects were almost transparent, foggy kind of like a cloud but in a V shape and glided very eloquently and smoothly. I have never seen anything other than normal meteorites in the night sky. I was very excited yet perplexed. I do feel validated though when I read on the Examiner that there was another sighting extremely similar just a few miles away from me and only 30 minutes prior to my sighting last night.",

It was around 22:45 on the night of 07/14/11 and my friend and I (both actors and musicians in our 20s) were outside smoking a cigarette.  I looked up at Orion\u2019s Belt and noticed what I thought was a star moving North Northeast at a smooth, steady pace.  The light was the same color as the other stars in the sky, a bright white with no flicker.  As I inspected the light I noticed that it was too high up to be a plane around Dallas (my house is right underneath the regular flight patterns for incoming planes into Love Field and DFW Airports) and it was moving too slowly to be a shooting star.   I thought it might have been a satellite due to the size of the light and the steady speed, but after 10 seconds the brightness swelled (not like a flash, but like someone manually changing the intensity of an indoor LED light) and dimmed back down, with the light beginning moving in a small zigzag or spiral pattern before it disappeared.  To me it looked like it just faded out of sight but my friend saw the light get smaller in the sky until it was completely gone about 8-10 seconds later, like it shot up into the sky at speeds unmatched by man-made craft.   The entire encounter took about 20 to 30 seconds and occurred just below Orion\u2019s Belt from our position.

The 2 in the back were almost crossing paths at one point.  I proceeded to pull over and get out of my vehicle just outside of town near a corn field to get a better look.  I got out of my vehicle and watched 4 of them rise into the sky and changed from a orange color to a silver light as what looked like as they went higher in altitude and disappeared into the sky which was from my vantage point was almost straight up from where i was standing.  Then 1 more appeared from the same western direction the rest of them came from.  It disappeared in the sky almost at the same location in the sky as the previous 4 had done.  These fireball looking objects were bright orange and they DID NOT have oscillating lights like a airplane would have and did not produce any noise.  I was the only witness, I called family across town at 20:53CDT and my phone cut out in the middle of the call so i called again at 20:56CDT to see if they could see these objects but by time they answered the phone these objects had already disappeared in to the sky.

      "story": "Royal blue blinking lights in formation across North Dallas sky. At the park in the dark with my son we see a lot of aircraft.  Our neighborhood is in the flight path of passenger jets flying into Love Field in Dallas, TX.  We have a hospital a 1/4 mile from our neighborhood to the NW and helicopters fly in and land frequently.  But all of a sudden we see 4 royal blue blinking lights in formation.  Three were in an isosolese triangle shape and a fourth was off to the side.  They appeared to be higher than one of the incoming jets initially, about twice as high.  They were blinking in a perfect pattern one after another - all four lights about .5 seconds apart.  They flew slowly North over our neighborhood at the same height it appeared until it was so far north that they almost disappeared entirely.  After about 15 minutes they came closer and brighter again but were much higher up in they sky and were directly above us to the West.  The forth light was trailing further behind and took off towards the West without the three lights in triangle formation.  The remaining three continued to climb straight up until they became smaller and smaller until they disappeared altogether almost directly above where we were standing.  The night was completely still - no breeze or wind at all.  The lights made absolutely no sound.",

As I watched these two orange colored stars, the top circular shaped object started to vanish.  This higher craft did move slightly before it gradually vanished.   At first I thought these might have been planes, but I've never seen a plane, or light from a plane, simply vanish before my very eyes.   I didn't see the lower circular orange craft vanish, though I assume that it did as well.   When I got down the hill to the lower trail, I turned around and it was gone as well.",

      "story": "Motionless small bright white dot in noontime sky northwest of Plano, Texas (DFW) sky vanished in an instant. This was a sighting that I experienced back in 1991, and although 26 years have passed, I thought I would document my experience here for the record.   On or about May 31, 1991, I was sitting in a recliner in my back yard by the pool.  The time was approximately 11:00 a.m.   Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bright small white dot in the northwest area of the sky.  I stared at this object for several minutes and it seemed to be at a very high altitude and just stood there motionless.   After staring at the object, I noticed a strange feeling as though they were surveying the entire Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.  I also had a strange feeling as though they knew I was watching them.  It is hard to describe, but it seems there was some kind of telepathic presence.  It made me feel slightly uneasy.   After watching the object for approximately another five minutes, this bright small dot of an object just \"popped\" out of view.  One second it was there, the next, it was gone.  I happened in an instant.   Although the motionless standing there was unusual, the real unusual thing was the feeling that I experienced of our entire metroplex being under surveillance and my feeling that whatever it was knew I (and whomever else witnessed it) was watching. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Daytime flying saucer that was in between its cloaking phase On March 17, 2010, at approximately 11:32AM, I was going out to get lunch for my wife and son. I walked out to my car which was parked in our driveway.  As I started backing up I looked out of my driver\u2019s side window after only backing up a few feet or so.  I saw a very strange object.  It was moving left, and then right, then left, and then right just going back and forth.  I started trying to think of what it might be while watching it for about 5 seconds.  I then realized that this was no ordinary object.  I got out of my car for a better look.  My neighborhood was fairly new so the trees were still not tall and didn\u2019t affect my viewing.  A few seconds after I got out of my car the UFO started to move my direction.  It moved very slowly without any sound at all.  It was very low.  I literally could\u2019ve thrown a rock at it and almost hit it when it passed over me it was that low. Description of UFO:  It\u2019s very hard to describe.  It was shaped like a typical flying saucer, but the dome part of it was larger than the typical flying saucer photos you see on the internet.  It was also not silver or shiny in any way.  It looked tan or light brown and had little red dots on it.  As it flew slowly towards me I noticed that the top half of the craft was disappearing. By the time it had almost reached me most of the UFO had vanished and I could only see the very bottom part of the UFO.  As it passed over me, I saw the bottom of the UFO and I was just a dark black circle.  Did not see any kind of detail other than that and after a few more seconds the UFO had completely vanished. Summary: In my opinion the UFO may have had problems cloaking or have been in a transition phase of doing so. When it was flying towards me and the top half vanished I could only see blue sky behind it. That really freaked me out because I now know that a UFO can cloak itself and be completely invisible. So the shape of the UFO was definitely a flying saucer it just had kind of an odd shape to it, kind of bulky, not like a slick styled UFO. The red dots were not random but in rows on the craft going up and down. I should also mention around 05:30PM that same evening there was a black helicopter flying around my neighborhood and did circle around my house a few times. That was the only time I\u2019d ever seen a helicopter around my neighborhood flying that low and I\u2019d lived there for around 7 years at the time. Ever since this event, (it changed my life) I\u2019ve been searching the internet and researching UFO\u2019s to find a similar sighting or to see if anyone else had seen the same thing I did. I still haven\u2019t found anything. I feel I may be one of the few people to ever see a flying saucer during its cloaking phase. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s taken me so long to report this on your site. I did originally post it to MUFON a few days afterwards but they never contacted me.",
