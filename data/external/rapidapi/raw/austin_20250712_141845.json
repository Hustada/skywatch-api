We were standing on the patio waiting for it to be time to watch the nightly movie. (Sidebar, my Buddy was the retired USAF person who accompanied the 2 police officers that got Whitman up on the University of Texas Tower mass shooting event.)  All of a sudden a shape started going from South West to the North East.  It was saucer shaped with lighted porthole type windows.  It was so huge and going so slowly that I wondered how it could sustain flight.  We looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders. We dared not say anything to each other much less the higher-ups because, if nothing else, we could lose our Top Secret clearance and hence our jobs. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

The paper I bought disappeared, and no record can be located in the archives, so far as I can locate.  Just very peculiar, was this a hoax for April Fools Day or what??",

      "story": "Played with by a UFO Returning from an night practice low level photo training mission in a RF4C as we were nearing Austin, Texas, at as I remember around 15,000ft, I noticed in the distance a light that would instantaneously and abnormally change positions ahead and below me.   I asked my Weapons Systems operator behind me if he happened to notice that and he responded very positively that he did.   It was a clear and beautiful evening with no clouds and a bright moon.  I told my back seater that I would maneuver to try to intercept what ever it was doing that.  It wasn't long before what ever it was was seemed to be playing games with me for it would be here and there and when I would go towards where ever I thought it would be, it would be gone.  We continued this for maybe a few minutes and by this time were somewhere Northwest of Austin and somewhere around 10,000 to 15,000 for our directions and altitudes kept changing due to this light in the sky I was trying to catch up with.   Suddenly in the distance before me the light made a tracking 180 degree turn and was obviously returning directly headon into us.  I made a comment to my back seater \"Damn \"___\" I think we've pissed it off.  I pushed the stick rapidly forward to avoid what I thought surely was going to be a midair collision. The instant I knew we had avoided the collision, I immediately went into afterburning to initiate a high g turn for that really angered me.   It may have just been my imagination, but as whatever it was we had just missed seem to give our aircraft a compression push downward.  That may have been from my own action of abruptly pushing the stick forward and then going into afterburner.   To continue, craning my head back during the high g turn, there is no doubt to me I saw an eerie blue glow quickly fading away from me.  For a brief a moment I thought the thing was gone and my back seater and I began a rather spirited conversation about the preceeding events.  I made calls to other aircraft in flight as well as both control towers in the area, BUT none had seen anything unusual.  Had almost called it a night when we both saw what looked like a firey crash just off of Robert Mueller airport.   I immediately called the control tower, but they said that all was normal and they saw nothing.  We circled just north of the airport for we both confirmed with each other what we had seen.  Suddenly, from off the airport the way it went in, we saw a spectacular show of something shooting into the sky to the north.  I again called the control tower but they saw nothing.   I pushed the throttle forward and flew in the direction of the thing we saw leaving the ground.   Suddenly before us and about over the city of Georgetown, the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life happened.  This thing we were pursuing stopped in mid air and lit up like with flashing lights and what looked like a classically described UFO, Oval in shape with portals and flashing and beaming lights coming from it.   My backseater and I confirmed together all we were seeing.  I told my back seater, as I remember, \"---\" this is too much. We need to bring this thing down -- it is too important to let it escape.  I am going to try to give it a glancing blow and think we will be ok, but be ready to eject if you have to.   I again went into afterburner and aimed for that UFO.  It suddenly went completely dark and the next thing we knew, we watched as it left an almost vertical path upward and we knew at the speed it was going, there was nothing we could do about it.  Within a few seconds it was gone and mixed in with the heavenly stars above.  Our fuel by this time demanded we land.   We did not make a report.  What was there to report that just the 2 of us experiencedd???   YES, we are being monitored and examined by a superior existence somewhere in this Universe.

It was about the year I graduated, 74,75 We moved west to get a better look and eventually came to park almost directly beneath one. The clouds where about 2 miles apart. The other quit a bit west yet. They moved very slowly to the south and stopped. They were amazing. The only thing I\u2019ve ever seen like them is the northern lights. The center was one color then another band of color towards the edge or circumfrance and an occasional third band of color would come and go. The clouds \u201cpulsed\u201d just like the northern lights from the center with thin sharp protrusions somewhat like a spinyfish or sea urchin. They were more flat and plate like than high and fluffy I quess they were about an eight to a quarter mile in diameter. They resembled the spin art pictures people often do at county fairs. Yet very sharp and defined. We got out of the car and laid on the ground for over an hour. We finally became board and went on our way. I have seen some amazing northern light over my 50 years. Many colors, many shapes and sizes. One night the whole sky from horizon to horizon and moving rapidly in waves. Breathtaking.! The police talkied about it all night on the radio. That was in the early 1980\u2019s. But these clouds were in the middle of the day. I think about 1pm or 2pm Very vivid and full like a single rain cloud but pulsing from the center and with very vivid colors. Deep clear color. I don\u2019t recall any normal clouds in the sky at all. Its been years and I really don\u2019t remember all the details. I have never seen them since, nor have I ever heard of anyone else seeing them besides the people with me. I may still be able to contact two of the others that were with me.

We watched it as we talked as we knew there was no tower or anything there. We eventually noticed it was slowly moving towards us. It took a good 20 minutes to go from the horizon to overhead. There was no sound and no other light. It did not variate in brightness at any angle. It seemed to stop overhead, maybe 3000 feet or less. Just far enough that a spotlight could not hit it. It drifted like a hot air balloon in speed.  While watching, I called the ATC tower at the local airport.  They confirmed they could see it visually but did not know what it was.  After a few minutes it just turned off. 2 minutes later it reappeared in the exact same spot on the South horizon again.  When I called ATC again, they advised they now knew what it was but couldn't tell me. I told them they might ought to before someone shoots at it or something stupid.  It repeated the exact same path until it was right overhead again, and then just turned off. We never found out what it was. I just thought it sounded exactly like the other report.

I quickly went into the dispatcher's office as the dispatcher was the only other person there that night and told her all about it while I tried to get my thoughts back together.  I later called the nearby airport and asked a guy in the tower if they were sending off weather balloons or if he had gotten a report of something like this.  He said that they weren't sending off weather balloons but he did recieve a report of a similar object 2 weeks prior from someone in a nearby community. My best explanation for the object is that it was an airplane moving away from my direction which gave the illusion that it wasn't moving and that it appeared to fade away when it got far enough.  The airport is close by and I know what airplanes look like flying over at night but this was very different and I haven't seen anything like it since that day.",

As I continued to look up the same flash occurred along the same trajectory about 30 degrees to the left, and then again another 30 degrees, for a series of three yellow pulsing flashes lasting one second each, timed about 2 seconds apart. This object was moving extremely fast.  The interesting thing is, immediately thereafter a prop jet appeared at about 10,000 feet from behind the tree line from approx. the same point of origin heading perpendicular to the trajectory of the unidentified object, and immediately after that a large jet at approx. 30,000 feet appeared from behind the tree line heading in the opposite direction. The vapor trail from the airliner was highlighted by the extreme angle of the setting sun. The impression this left was of the object passing hastily between the headings of the two aircraft   As I watched the contrail, I asked myself if the flashes were some kind of natural artifact of the sunset, but my instinct tells me the object was real and traveling at a high velocity.",

While watching TV at 10:30PM, I glanced out my living room window and noticed two bright lights that looked about over Lake Travis, just to the right of Mansfield Dam.  They looked stationary, which seemed odd, so I got my 30 power binoculars out and went out on my deck to get a better look.  I watched these two lights for about 5 minutes which stayed at the same altitude (I\u2019d guess about 2,000 feet) and parallel to each other.  They were rock solid and did not move up or down and stayed the same distance from each other.  I\u2019d estimate they were at least 100 yards, maybe further, from each other and very large and bright.  The light emitted seemed elongated on the bottom side of the lights, so maybe the light of both was being directed downward.  There were no other lights such as colored navigation lights, strobes, etc.  I thought this was very odd.  I am very familiar with all kinds of aircraft lighting as I was an aircraft maintenance specialist (jet over two engines) in the Air Force.  This was no plane or helicopter(s) hovering.  All of a sudden, after about 5 minutes of observation, both lights slowly dimmed down to about 20% of the original intensity.  Then they began to move, one going lower than the other as if a very large craft in a banking turn to the north east.  It then moved to the east and I was amazed that this appeared to be a single craft, not two individual ones.  The lights still kept the same relative distance from each other and sped across the horizon in a matter of seconds, it was totally gone in 4 or 5 seconds.  I never was able to make out a clear structure, but believe it was a chevron or triangle shaped, by observing the lights and how they moved together.",

I was inspired to finally report about what I saw 23 years ago by the recent interest spurred by the Stevenville, Texas sighting.  I have probably told this to approximately 10 to 15 people in all these years because as any other person that has seen a UFO can tell you \u201cpeople think you are crazy\u201d. This sighting happened in September or October of 1985. I was a teacher for a trade school for Austin Community Collage and a local union in Austin Texas.  I let out class around 9:00 PM on a Thursday night.  My route home took me down South Lamar to Brodie Lane.  This area of Austin was mostly farm land back then.  As I turned left onto Brodie, I saw an object in the sky moving over the farm house on my right.  I stopped and got out of my truck to get a better look.  There were a few other cars going by and I tried to get them to stop and see but they just kept going by.  It was approximately 150 yards from me and 200 feet off the ground.  It looked like both wings of a jet connected in the middle, boomerang or V shaped,  but there was no fuselage.  I later learned it was called chevron. On the front there were 6 extremely bright white lights, two close together on each side of the center and  single lights towards the tips.  Behind it where fuselage should be, was a hazy, foggy, reddish-pink glow.  It was moving steadily only about 5 miles per hour, silently except for a 3 or 4 second blast of what sounded like high pressure air release every 30 seconds.  I watched it for around 20 minutes  as it flew north-northwest directly over Barton Creek Mall. I called Bergstram, the closest Air Force base at that time, to report the sighting.  For the next few days I went back and forth with phone calls with different people and then they gave me the brush off.  They did, however, tell me they had no aircraft flying that night.  It feels good to report this after all these years.  This is the first time I have written down this experience.  I hope it will jog someone else\u2019s memory that was in the area and serious investigation continues. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

I watched the light for approximately 20 minutes, during which time the object did not appear to move at all.

I do not believe that this was an optical illusion, given that I closed my eyes several times to find the same set of lights in the sky when I reopened them. This second light appeared brighter than the first, and it was slowly moving within close proximity of the first light. Moments later it was gone all at once, only to return again a few minutes later. At this point I began to walk toward the nearest convenience store, and when I arrived there, I was able to point the lights out to a strange man who was getting into his car.

At first I thought it might have been an airplane since aircraft do fly along that route on final approach to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. This however just appeared like a star. I never blinked or changed color. After about 1 minute of viewing it stopped and remained stationary for about 2 minutes before proceeding on a N-NW heading. After about 20 seconds of that heading it changed and started heading SW coming to a stop again after about 15 seconds. It remained in position for about 2 minutes before heading W again. I then saw it stop and hold position for about 3-5 minutes. During this time, the clouds began to move into the area and altough they covered the stars, they only obscured the object. I believe it was either bright enough to be visible through the clouds or may have been in the clouds. I saw it proceed to head W again through the faint bit of light in the clouds and finally lost it after another couple minutes. I did not hear any sounds, witness any other lights or aircraft in the area. The next aircraft to fly in the vicinity did not arrive until about 20 minutes after I last saw the object. I also was unable to get the object on my camera phone because it blended into the stars too well.",

      "story": "Green triangle light display over ACL festival in Austin. I was watching Reverend Horton Heat at the Austin City Limits music festival on this Friday night.  It was at least half way through the show so it must have been about 8:15-8:30.  I can't remember why but for some reason I glanced over toward one of the main stages to the west of where I was.  I saw it about 20 degrees over the horizon and about 30 degrees to the north of the sliver of the moon.  I saw a flashing light and a steady dimmer light.  At first I thought was a helicopter since a police helicopter had flown over the festival several time that night.  If it was a helicopter I would guess it at about 3 or 4 miles away based on the separation and brightness of the lights.  Then it did something that freaked me out.  Suddenly a huge triangular pattern of big bright green lights began flashing very rapidly.  No two lights seemed to flash in sync, it was just wild random flashing of too many lights to count.  The lights were all on the parameter of the triangle pattern with none in the middle.  The weird thing was that if it was a helicopter putting on a light show, then the lighting attachments would have to have been at least the size of a football field or two.  Compared to the distant object I thought I'd seen a second before the triangle light display was enormous.  The light display continued for about 10 seconds as I stared in disbelief trying to figure out what the heck it was.  Just as I started to get the attention of my friend the light show stopped.  I was left explaining to him that the tiny flashing light that he couldn't hardly make out from the other distant aircraft in the sky had just put on a massive light show as if it was right over the festival.  It continued to fade into the distance until I couldn't make it out any more.  I'm ready to accept that this was a human aircraft putting on a lighting display.  The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is the brightness and sure size of the triangular green light display compared to the other lights.",

      "story": "Afternoon sighting of stationary white spherical object Late in the afternoon of a bright and clear day, my daughters and I were taking a walk along what is known as Auditorium Shores in downtown Austin Texas.  The Colorado River (or Town Lake as it is called) runs through the city of Austin and there is a green belt, with hike and bike trails running parallel to the river on both sides.  I was looking up at the sky, which was particularly blue with beautiful cumulous nimbus cloud formations, when I spotted a small white circular object almost directly above us.  The object appeared to be stationary and was positioned very high in the sky.  I was very surprised and I pointed it out to my two (almost) teenage daughters.  I tried to recognize it as possibly a planet, or a balloon or even a strange and bright star but could not say it was any of those things.  It was the same color as the beautiful cumulous nimbus clouds but of apparent solid structure with a definitive circumference.  We stopped walking and began to only observe the object.  Like I mentioned it appeared to be stationary, white in color and circular in shape.  While observing the object a large plane, which I recognized as a commercial airliner, flew near it and I was able to compare the object to the plane.   The object appeared to be higher in the atmosphere than the plane which looked pretty small.  The plane was at an angle as if it was climbing to cruising altitude.   The airliner cruised on by the object, strengthening my conviction that the object was not traveling in the sky, but was stationary.   I looked around often to observe the people out walking, running, biking and fishing along Town Lake.  No one appeared to be aware of the object.  We began walking again and periodically looking back up at the object.  After a few moments, my daughter started exclaiming that the object was breaking into two pieces!  I looked up again, refocused my gaze.  I too observed what appeared to now be two circular objects; however their sides appeared to still be touching.   I readjuste! d my eye s for several different looks as I know that an object at a distance can appear to be two due to a trick of our eyes.  No matter how I readjusted my gaze the object did appear to be morphing into two circular objects.  After only a few moments, it appeared to morph back into one object again.  My daughter and I where exasperated and excited by the strange behavior!  A few minutes later, we came upon a man fishing and we stopped to point out the object to him.  Due to his confinement in a wheel chair and apparent poor eye sight he never was able to see the object.    He could not position his head to look almost directly above us to see the object.  The man felt it might be a planet and politely dismissed us.   Not wanting to appear strange I quickly agreed with him.  About that time a cloud began to move in front of the object.   I could still see it through the cloud cover for several more minutes but by this point the novelty was wearing off and we resumed our hike.   Even if it is a UFO, I thought to myself, it is positioned too far off and people where not even noticing it.   Nevertheless, I looked diligently in that area of the sky for the remainder of the hike and did not see the object again even though the cloud had moved on.  I took the man\u2019s assumption that it was probably a planet to heart.  I felt that if it was a planet I would be able to see it when the clouds moved on, but I never saw it again during the rest of the day.   I scanned the whole sky looking for the object but it was gone.  So upon returning home I looked on the internet to see what planet might be visible to the naked eye during daylight hours at this time of year and at our location.  I could not find any information pertaining to a day time planet visibility for our area or anywhere near us for that matter.   I am baffled as to the odd behavior of the object and felt that if it was a planet it would not have apparently morphed into two objects nor would it disappear from view.   A planet would have remained on its path thro! ugh the sky.",

There were six of them that looked to be evenly spaced apart.  I have been going outside on break here for the last 8 years and have never seen the uniform pattern I saw today. There were actually at least ten to twelve contrails all over the sky. I looked up in the sky above our building and to the west and I saw an object in the sky just sitting there. As I was staring at it all of a sudden to the left appeared another one and it was moving from west to east.  It passed right in front of the 1st object. They could have almost collided. It was moving at a steady pace. It was not moving too fast. It was not that high in the sky. I guess if I had to compare it to my building. My building is about 18 to 20 feet high. I was looking at an angle and it was probably 2 \u00bd to 3 times my building in height in the sky and 100 to 150 yards away maybe. I got a good look at it. It was oval shaped, it looked to be silver. I watched it go about several hundred yards and then fade out. It disappeared. I looked back to see the other one, but it was gone. It was really cool to see. I couldn\u2019t believe it. This is not my first sighting of a UFO, but it was definitely the most awesome to see. I started to laugh because it happened right in my plain view of sight. I didn\u2019t have to squint or guess at what I was seeing.  I immediately called my wife and then my father after. I see planes fly over all day going to Austin Bergstrom. 737\u2019s, 747\u2019s, cargo plane\u2019s, jet\u2019s, Cesena\u2019s and helicopter\u2019s every once in awhile.

It was a typical Monday, I went to my regular state job which was between 7am to 4pm.  After that I went to my part time job.  There was nothing to my mind that was out of the ordinary.  It was a boring day at my regular job and slow at my part time job since there was hardly any customers.  After getting out of work I went to Target to buy a coke and Doritos flirted with the cashier and went on to the bus stop that takes me to the corner of Wickersham and Oltorf.  This area is at a high point and you can see the downtown area and it\u2019s sky line.  There was a thunderstorm also moving in and was coloring the sky red then lightning would flash. As I was walking to my apartment I saw something flying over the downtown Austin area heading south.  I was standing in the middle of the side walk between Oltorf and the High Point Apartments looking at this thing because it was slowly making it\u2019s way south and it was flying to low and too slow to be a plane.  When I thought it could be a blimp it flashed several colors of red, yellow, blue, in a multiple square formation.  A helicopter with one spot light was flying south and keeping it\u2019s distance from the object.  I would say it flew above the Ben White HWY area and it was flying higher then the object I was looking at.  That was when it reversed it\u2019s direction and headed north east.  (It did not make a U-turn).  I needed a witness but nobody was walking near by.  I called my sister via cel phone but did not answer.  Then at 8:55pm I called a co worker who was outside her house and told her to look south and she let out a big gasp she yelled, \u201cwhat is that\u201d!  She lives in north Austin.  We stayed on the phones looking at this thing.  As it moved back to the downtown area it moved around the downtown area and moved north east.  It then picked up speed and moved faster and out of my sight.  We stayed on the phone for a while more reveling at what we saw and then ended our call.  I told my roommate of what I saw.  He said he believed me and I told him if he were to come in that night and said he just saw what I just saw I would not believe him.  I am typing this because other people have come forward in the past on a web site called http://www.ufomaps.com/city/Austin My co-worker and the people who saying they saw the same thing I saw is more then I want to think about.  Why it was not in the news I do not know.  About an hour later my best friend called to talk about a possible hunting trip for December.  I did not talk about what I saw.  To me it is now the difference of living my regular way of life.  I do not do drugs, don't drink, nor was I on any medication.  I do not consider myself wanting any special attention from strangers.  I will never mention this to anybody even if the subject is about UFO\u2019s. I do not know where to go from here.  I think UFO\u2019s exist I just would never think I would ever see one myself.  This to me is just plain mind numbing.  I don\u2019t want to think about, talk about, let alone write about what I saw that night.  This will go as far as I would want to go.

      "story": "Triangular or diamond-shaped craft produced rhythmic circular humming as it slowly flew by very low in the sky. Last night on March 19, 2008, I was coming home from the grocery store and was about to turn onto my street, when I observed a really bright light up in the sky above what used to be a field next to my neighborhood. Now, there is new construction going on every day and I wasn\u2019t sure if the bright light was atop a new cell phone or radio tower that may have been built next door or if it was a search light on a helicopter. At first, I couldn\u2019t tell whether the light was stationary or moving very slowly so those were the two possibilities that immediately came to mind. I parked the car in front of my house and was about to unload groceries when I noticed the bright light was gone. Instead, an object was moving very slowly and steadily from the north, where I originally saw the bright light, to the south and it passed directly overhead, quite low in the sky. If I had to guess, I would say it was perhaps 20 stories from the ground. I couldn\u2019t tell whether it was triangular or diamond-shaped, but it was one of those, judging by the half a dozen or so red and blue blinking lights on the underside of the craft. I can\u2019t stress enough how slowly and how low in the sky it was much lower than a plane would fly. The other unusual thing I noticed was the sound it made. It was a humming sound that repeated in a circular fashion. It was definitely made by a machine, but it didn\u2019t clank metallically, and it wasn\u2019t high-pitched. It\u2019s difficult to describe, but it was certainly rhythmic and repetitive. I am not sure how big it was because I couldn\u2019t see the entire outline of the craft, but it was much larger than a helicopter and probably smaller than or about the size of a football field. I wasn\u2019t afraid as I watched the object make its way slowly southward. Instead I was curious, trying to figure out what I was looking at. Unfortunately, my camera was in my upstairs bedroom and my camera phone is virtually worthless at night. It wasn\u2019t long before I lost sight of the object and went into the house with my groceries. The time was exactly 11:30 pm when I walked in the front door. I estimate that the entire sighting took about five minutes. I awakened my housemate and told him what I\u2019d witnessed, and then called my sister to tell her, too. I mentioned it to my boyfriend the following morning and he said that there are now planes that can hover, but that they would have no business doing that above a residential area. All I know is that it didn\u2019t look or sound like any kind of plane I\u2019ve ever seen or heard. One second it was there and the next, it was gone. The night was cold and clear. There was a full moon with little or no breeze in far south Austin, Texas. I was completely sober and have no history of mental illness or attention-seeking.

      "story": "A man and his two kids see a clear UFO less than a mile away during an autumn evening in Austin, Texas.  Dazed deer present. I\u2019ve had 6 sightings in my life, but none as good as this one. I had recently sold my car, where I kept a nice set of binoculars for the sole purpose of looking at a UFO closer if and when I saw another one, and was now driving the family van with my two kids on our way to get gasoline, and then to the store.   This particular evening was fairly clear, and, as I was driving down a slightly winding street to get onto a major street, I saw an orange object just above the tree line that, during the brief moment I had to see it, first made me think of the moon when it's low on the horizon and has an orange glow, the way it looks during an lunar eclipse.  However, I felt that the moon should be a bigger, and also that it wasn't in the direction of the sky where the moon usually is, so I looped around the other neighborhood streets and came back up the same street, slower, to get a second look. Sure enough, when I saw it again, there was no mistaking it, it was definitely a hovering UFO similar to one whose picture was taken on December 21, 1994, by Carlos Diaz, so I turned off my headlights, came to a stop where I had the best view, lowered the windows, and turned off the van. Believe me when I tell you that based on the terrain of this area, even though it's surrounded by houses, businesses, a high school, and a very busy major street, where this UFO was hovering was not observable except for about 50 yards on this one street where I was parked. I told my kids to look at the object, and told them it was a spaceship.  They were 3 and 5 years old at the time, and though innocent, they were very interested in hearing about a real spaceship, especially because they were fans of the movie Toy Story. The object was not a thin disk or cigar shaped.  Honestly, it looked a lot more like a slightly squashed lemon, except with two \"nipples\" on either side instead of a stem on one side and a nipple on the other.  It glowed a uniform orange, and it had white beacon lights, one on top, and one on the bottom, across its perpendicular axis.  It had a row of very small white lights across its horizontal axis, dividing the craft equally above and below.  The beacon lights were blinking about 3 times per second but not in sync with each other.  The object was about 3 stories off the ground, and less than a mile away from us, but I really can't estimate the exact distance.  I would say somewhere between half a mile and a mile.  I could not make out any more detail, and believe me; I REALLY missed not having my binoculars that day. I had a red laser pointer on me that I use at work, and my son asked me to point it at the object, but I ignored him.  He happened to have a flashlight that he'd gotten recently in his pocket, so before I knew it, he had taken it out and turned it on to point it at \"them\".  I moved his arm down, gently, but he could see I was being cautious.  He asked why I didn't want to signal them, and I said that I wasn't sure it was a good idea.  In my mind, I was thinking, \"I don't know if they are good or bad, and I don't want to inadvertently volunteer my kids to become regular abductees.\"  I was also thinking, \"Man, if only my kids weren't here, I'd get out of this van and run to get a closer look, but I'm trapped under these circumstances.\"  Anyway, to make a long story short, we watched this object for at least 3 minutes, and it was just hovering there, so in my impatience to get a closer look, I remembered a business parking lot that was adjacent (left of the object from our point of view) to the forest that this object was hovering over, and I thought, \"If I time the signal light properly, I can quickly race the van to make the left turn, go down a block or two into the business parking lot, and then drive to the edge of the parking lot closest to the object. Perhaps from there I can see it closer through the trees\", so without hesitating much, that's what I did.  As I raced the van and the trees blocked my view, the last glimpse I caught of the object was that it was still hovering in the same place, so I was very hopeful of being able to get a better look. However, when I got into the business parking lot, I found a big surprise - there were no less than 50, and probably more like 100 deer in the parking lot, and they were in a dazed, almost frozen state.  They moved very little, to the point that I had to steer around a few of them to avoid hitting them.  That in itself was remarkable, and only reinforced my belief that this object was not human-made, that the occupants had somehow put these deer in a trance.   After finally getting to where I thought I could see the object, I was disappointed to find out that I could not see it anywhere, so as fast as I could, again avoiding the deer in my way, I worked my way back to where I was before, and unfortunately the object was now gone.   After this event, my son drew a picture of what he saw, and it was essentially what I saw.  Both my children still remember the event, even though my daughter was so young, perhaps because we've retold it several times, but I certainly don't want them to forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I have the drawing somewhere in a box in the attic or inside a book, but I can't remember where exactly, and it's been over 7 years now since the incident.  If I ever run into it, I'll scan it and send it to you.   My apologies for not having kept better records.  I considered contacting an investigator from MUFON way back then to check woods below where the object was hovering, but I never did.  I was no willing to put my children in any type of danger. I still keep my eye out in the sky, so if I ever catch anything again, I'll also send it your way. ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

They were flying quite low, lower than all of the usual airplanes that fly over our area, and they were moving smoothly at a very high speed, we only watched them for about five or six seconds before they were out of sight. It's possible that they were military as they were flying in the direction of Ft. Hood, but I don't know of any unclassified silent glowing military aircraft that could travel at those speeds.",

I am genuinely scared and would appreciate someone to collaborate or explain what I saw. This new house I am renting doesn't allow smoking indoors so I went outside my window and sat on the roof enjoying the smoke. I saw 2 things just minutes apart which I cannot explain nor forget. It would have been around 1:00 or 1:05AM when I sat up and barely noticed something off in the sky. It looked like CGI or artists drawing of a comet. It had that leading umbrella like front that a comet does, but it had no tail. It looked like it had a wedge shape but you could only make out a front and the \"back\" wasn't visible. It moved from right to left from in the sky and was all but invisible against the sky. I only noticed it because it was moving and it seemed very far away and was very faint. As its view crossed across a streetlight it was obscured (washed out by the light). When it came back into view its wedge shape seemed a less of a point and much more rounded in front. It didn't do anything specific and very well could have been a comet, but I doubt it as it would have had to move across the sky line in 1-2 minutes. I took 2 pictures with my cell phone but nether show anything except that light across the street (it was that faint). I was pretty freaked out and called my friend in VA and talked to her about it and while I was on the phone something else happened and now I am scared in my room. I was on the phone with this girl and getting anxious about what I saw and was about to walk through my window when I saw 3 lights VERY CLOSE. If anyone is familiar as to how low the planes fly over Arlington, VA (above the buildings and high rises) when flying into National Airport, it seemed to be about the highest height the planes take before they drop altitude for final approach. That is to say it was so close that I would have heard something. It moved from right to left and was very very close. This defiantly had a triangular isosceles shape (from the 3 lights being in the corner). It was nearly straight above me and moved in a straight line or maybe it had a slight curve to its path. The lights did not illuminate a body of any sort but kept a perfect triangular shape. There was no blinking, NO NOISE and no fucking way I want to see it again. It was fast, but if it was as close as I think it was then it wouldn't have been as fast as the faint/far first object I saw. My friend on the phone was panicing because I was panicing and I woke one of my new roommates but he didn't want anything to do with it. At least he saw the fear I had. If anyone has any idea what it was or can collaborate what was in the sky please please post it. BTW, I have been in Austin less then 24 hours and I am almost willing to pack the car and move back to DC... deposit be damned. I won't be sleeping tonight until my roommates wake up, it isn't as though I'm a coward, far from it. I just can't explain what it is. If I could explain it or understand it or even deny it I'd probably feel a lot better right now. Thanks,",

      "story": "Amber glow with two star-like points of light all moving in a triangular formation At 8:47 pm on 2-7-07 while waiting for the UT shuttle, I witnessed an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon for about two minutes.  I first spotted a very faint amber object about 150 feet in the night sky above Waller Creek running alongside San Jacinto St in front of the UT Art Building.  At first I thought it was a balloon or parachute floating, but as I observed it more intently, it was more of a dim, amber/golden glow, roughly trapezoidal, but it was more amorphous and had no hard edges.  I had dark shades running through it, as if something were inside it, or possibly surrounding the glow--it was hard to tell.  I tracked it visually as it flew silently, north over Waller Creek at a steady, slow pace maintaining the same altitude.  I then noticed that below the amber object were two very dim points of light similar to stars that were moving with it.  The points of light were at odd angles from the amber glow and their distance from each other formed an uneven triangle.  All three lights moved together and stayed in the same triangular formation.  My eyes were transfixed as I tried to determine what it could have been.  Being an artist with excellent observational skills, I flipped through every possible explanation in my head: It didn\u2019t even remotely resemble a plane. The moon and stars don\u2019t fly along. The objects were not solid like a balloon, parachute, weather balloon, or any other aircraft.  Also, the amorphous quality of the amber glow and the dimness of the two moving star-like objects just didn\u2019t make sense to me, compared with regular airplanes I\u2019ve seen hundreds of times before.  Something was just not right about this thing.  I thought about running to keep up with it, but I was exhausted from having just run 4 miles at the track, and I think it was traveling too fast to follow on foot, though a car could have kept up with it easily.  As the objects moved farther away, my bus showed up and I had to leave.  When I got on the bus and looked around at people, I had a heightened sense of awareness of my surroundings, particularly my visual and olfactory senses--lights were much more intense than usual and I was acutely aware of everyone\u2019s movements and of the faintest smells around me.  For the rest of the night I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the UAP.  I kept thinking about what normal object would match what I had seen earlier, but there were none.  I know what I saw and it was anything but normal.  I\u2019m very reluctant to mention this to anyone, but I thought it important to at least report what I witnessed.",

      "story": "It was right after dark, Wednesday,  February 4, 2009.  I had just let the dog out for a run.  The sky was clear with only a few stars visible and the moon was not up yet.  It was unusually quiet.  There were no airliners, private planes, helicopters or military jets in the sky at the time. I was alone, standing at the edge of the walkway, in the dark at my rural home, looking at the stars.  The only light was my yellow porch light which was 35 or    40 feet behind me.    I was looking toward the north west and noticed a large very bright round object moving toward me very slowly.  I thought it had to be either the ISS or STS so I ran into my house to get my binoculars so I could watch it clearly.  I also made a note of the time.  It was 18:59. As I watched the object approach I noticed that it appeared to be flying at an even altitude and it was traveling in a weaving pattern, moving from the left then back to the right.  The object made no sound.  It had no navigational lights and no FAA red and green strobe lights.  It emitted a steady white light.  I have no idea how far up this object was.  I had difficulty looking at it. It was so bright it hurt my eyes.  It did appear to be the size of a dinner plate  The object came to a dead stop right across from me and sat still for about 10 seconds.  Then it blinked out and moved to the south west, right above me.   Needless to say, I almost panicked and ran but I couldn\u2019t move.  I was frozen and I could not breath.  I felt as if it was staring at me while I was staring at it.  I immediately thought, what is this thing and how can it see me in the dark?  It sat there for almost a minute, then it started moving again, to the south east, at a faster pace and in a straighter line.  When it was almost out of sight it veered to the left and disappeared.  I got my dog and ran into the house, closed and locked my door and looked at the time.  It was 19:03. I have lived either on or outside of military bases  my entire life and I have seen some pretty unusual objects in the sky and in the water, but I have never experienced this before.  I sincerely hope that I continue to see UFO\u2019s, but only at a distance. I did not report this sighting to any law enforcement agencies but I did contact NASA in Houston to ask if they knew what this object might be.  They did not know but they did say that it was not one of their satellites.    Their satellites do not zig zag across the sky and they do not stop in mid air. I hope reading this helps anyone who has had a similar experience.",

      "story": "I was driving northbound on I-35, and was around 5 miles south of Austin when I noticed an intensely bright white light far ahead on the horizon line, directly in front of me.  It was the brightest and most white light I\u2019d ever seen (and still have ever seen to this day, some 12 years later).   After a few minutes I realized it was still there, directly in front of me, maybe 20 miles ahead.  It was very low on the horizon and now I started to wonder what it might be.  I discarded aircraft because there are no headlights this bright, and even if they were, they\u2019d have to be flying directly southbound over I-35, which I doubt they\u2019d do.  I thought it might be a commercial spotlight that somehow had been pushed downward, aiming straight at me, but I couldn\u2019t see any beam projecting from the source.   I was traveling around 70mph and getting closer to it by the minute.  After about 10 minutes I realized that the light was not stationary.  It was slowly moving westward, to my left.  I was really mesmerized by this thing now, and couldn\u2019t for the life of me figure out what it could be. When it got much closer, I pulled the car over, turned off the engine and got out.  The craft was triangular in shape, and maybe the width of two to three 737 planes wing-to-wing.  What first struck me was that it was completely silent.  If the light hadn\u2019t attracted my attention, you never would have known it was there.  It was slowly moving, almost drifting, south-westerly, maybe 500 feet off the ground.   The other thing that struck me is that now, from underneath, I could no longer see the white light, but instead saw 3 different colored lights, one on each top of the triangle.  One was red, one was green and the other yellow, all solid. As I stood in awe, a patrol car pulled off the road onto the shoulder coming southbound.  The officer got out and stood looking up at the craft, just as I was doing.  I jumped back into the car and drove right thru the grass, crossing the median and onto the southbound side.  While this was completely against the law, the officer and I didn\u2019t even discuss it.  We just stood there staring at the craft. Now, as it was moving away from us, we could no longer see the 3 colored lights on the tips of the triangle.  All you could see from the back was a much larger, round red light in the center of the craft that was slowly pulsating.  I couldn\u2019t make out how tall the craft was, just the approximate width.  The slowly pulsating red light was almost hypnotic, but our attention was broken by the arrival of a 2nd patrol car, this one the State Police.  He too got out and watched the craft moving away.  I asked them if they\u2019d already checked with Austin-Bergstrom airport, and they had, reporting now commercial traffic anywhere near here or anything like what we were seeing. After a few more minutes of the two officers discussing their confusion and fascination, I jumped in my car and headed back down I-35 from where I\u2019d just come.  I chased the craft for a few more minutes, driving about 70mph again, as it was now getting further and further off to my right (westerly).  I finally pulled off the highway and tried going down a side road to head more westerly, but by then it had disappeared from sight. I didn\u2019t see anything about it in the papers, despite looking thru the Austin American Statesman for days afterwards.  I wish I\u2019d gotten the names of the officers who witnessed this with me, but I didn\u2019t.  I was too taken by what I was seeing in the sky.

It appeared to be spinning across the sky.  The rate of rotation and movement remained constant. There were a few clounds in the sky and the object was below the cloud level.  I watched it pass under a cloud that was close to directly overhead.  I observed the object for a few minutes, until it was too far away to see. The object made no detectable sound.  I don't know what this was, but it was clearly not a bird or a plane.  For a moment I thought it was a plastic grocery bag being blown very high, but when it got closer I could clearly see that it was rotating at a steady pace.

      "story": "Object was appearing in different places of the sky, changing magnitudes, and other bizzare behaviors. My Mother and I were just about to lay down on our pool deck for a cigarette and star gaze as we usually do after dinner.  As I lay down on my lawn chair (which are facing west) and looked up I saw an \u201cunusual\u201d object moving in the sky. The reason it caught my eye was because it was very bright but seemed to be very far away. The first thing I did was yell to my mom, \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d She looked up just before the object moved behind a small cloud. As it came out on the other side of the cloud it was no longer as bright as it appeared. It kept moving North (so as we lay there it look like it was moving left to right) just a little bit above Vega. After traveling for about 7 more seconds it slowly disappeared. At this point we thought that we were just looking at a satellite that, for some reason, appeared to very bright (a magnitude grater than -1) for those few seconds above us. To describe the type of light that it was giving off I used this analogy. When you are driving at night and cars are coming toward you, you notice that the head lights are sometimes a yellowish and on newer cars are more of a \u201cneon white\u201d if you will. The object in the sky looked more like the \u201cneon white\u201d headlights and the typical star and satellite look more like the yellowish headlights. Approximately two minuets later at 19:02 the same bright \u201cneon white\u201d object appeared right above us again, but his time was going the opposite direction so more towards the south west. It then looked to change its course again so now it was heading almost directly South. At this time my mom and I started to really question what we were seeing because satellites do not change their direction from heading north to heading south. As we watched the object  move \u201cdown\u201d we kept saying to each other \u201cwhat the hell is that?\u201d it finally went out of sight. My mom told me that she was going to go get her binoculars, but I said, \u201cscrew that we needed a video camera, my phone (to know the time), and my journal (so I could write down what I was seeing while it was still fresh in my head), and a blanket. She was gone for about 5 minuets. As she was walking up the pool deck stairs, at about 19:08 now, she asked me if I had seen it again and just as she asked me that I was looking off into the western sky below Vega but above Hercules and saw a much dimmer object that looked more like a satellite but it would appear then disappear and it did this about 5 times before it did not reappear again. What was strange was the time intervals in-between the appearing and disappearing was not constant and the light was more of a reddish light not the same \u201cneon white\u201d as before. After watching this object and its many different behaviors, I can not say that it even remotely resembled anything that I have ever seen in our night sky before. It was not an airplane because airplanes stay on one direct path, it was not a satellite because however satellites do sometimes seem to be going in and out of vision, they do not change there apparent magnitudes as drastically as this object did. I think that it is also notable that from the time my mom and I were on our pool deck (19:00 to 21:00) we saw 4 big meteors and 1 huge meteor in which we could see smoke and debris on its tail. I am a college student here in Austin and spend a lot of time studying the sky and weather I believe this was an \u201calien space craft\u201d or just an object that I myself could not identify, is in my opinion, irrelevant. But if there is a rational explanation for what my mom and I were seeing I would love to know.",

      "story": "UFO Sighting in Austin, TX, over UT/Capital Night Before 9/11 I have kept this a secret for many years because I never knew what to do with the information.  I always thought the experience was awe inspiring and that the timing of the event was extremely coincidental.  But in retrospect, after flipping backwards through my journal, ANY EVENT BEFORE 9-11 is significant.  I have searched for others' reports of UFO activity on 9-10 but have found none, and therefore find it useful to finally let this information out for the universe to chew on. Here is my journal entry:   \"Monday 10 - Nighttime...walking back from Starbucks, I see a trapazoid shaped object flying through the sky...underneath this object were [many] faint lights...about 600-900ft off ground.\"   Context: I was an engineering student at the University of Texas at the time and was walking back to my dorm at the time.  I was standing right outside the University Coop on Guadalupe St., looking up above the UT Tower.  I was waiting at the crosswalk and had nothing better to do other than look up, when suddenly, I noticed these lights traveling at great speed.  At first I thought I was seeing birds illuminated by the UT Tower, but then birds don't travel that high, that smoothly, that quickly. The object was flying southbound passing nearly above the UT Tower, traveling towards the Texas Congressional building.  Now I'm no expert, but I would assume that any area above UT/Texas Congress would be restricted, a no-fly zone.  My memory may be hazy here but I would say it traveled about a mile in 5 seconds.  That's roughly 720 mi/hr.  I only say a mile because that's what I would estimate a normal person can see at night looking up.",

He thought it was a light tower, but my other friend who's house we had just left said \"there are no light towers around here\". Right after he said that we spotted another one. They seemed to be stationary in the sky. We stopped on a bridge over a creek to get a better look when all of a sudden they started to move. Next more of them, one by one, started to appear seemingly from the creek. Three of them formed a perfect triangle and then a perfectly straight line(stopping for a few seconds each time). We sat on the bridge for about 10 minutes and saw about 15 or 20 orbs floating/dancing oddly but gracefully through the sky. As I stared at them individually I could not tell exactly how close or far away they where, or what was making them glow. When we started driving away I kept looking back and saw them spanning the whole s! kyline behind us. Regretfully none of us got any pictures or videos. But I found pictures and video online from some sightings in the UK that looks exactly like what we saw. That was probably the craziest thing I have ever experienced.

The Moon was very Bright that night allowing you to see past the clouds and the stars beyond. I was standing there and looking at the Bright Moon along with a huge search/event light from some event somewhere circling back and forth against the clouds and the sky. As I was watching and starring at the moon, my eyes caught a dark, round dot looking thing moving inside the fast moving clouds. It was hard to see but you can at times clearly see it was round as if watching a perfect dot (circle) in the sky and dark, it was jerking back and forth in different patterns. Moving very fast, back and forth in different patterns and directions. Then it stopped and lit up very bright and it was gone. As soon as I noticed it the first time I pointed it out to my son and my wife. He could not see what I was looking at , at first, then he noticed it right before it lit up and he said after it lit up it took off at a hi rate of speed. My wife was also trying to see it and she got a glimpse of it at the last moment. I was pointing up at it trying to get the crowd to see it, but did! n\u2019t notice anyone else looking at it, besides the search/event light would have made them look at that first and distract from the object. Balloons were being released and I compared the object to a balloon but balloons never made it that hi up and would not have been as big at that height.  I work as a computer engineer; my son is active duty army. The object was directly above us when noticed.

The object moved over to the left at a weird angle, stalled and then went up at 118 degrees. And when I say up I mean Galactic. I was as if you could see it leaving the Solar system.",

      "story": "Large Triangle over Austin Texas 1979 In the winter of '79, a friend of mine and I were walking along the campus of The University of Texas in Austin. It was dark out, being aprox. 9:00 in the evening. I would estimate around 30 people were also in the area that I could see with folks on both sides of the street we were on. What got my attention was the whole area lighting up suddenly as if someone had turned on amber colored floodlights that illuminated the street and buildings as if it were suddenly day. The origin of the light came from above us. There, hovering above the UT Tower was a triangular shaped craft aprox. 100 yards in length with amber colored glowing half-bulbs at each corner underside of the craft. It made no noise and hovered for about 20-30 seconds. Everyone on the street saw it and we all pointed at it. I was very excited and the feeling I had was one of pure elation. The object moved silently towards the south and downtown area of Austin and then seemed to accelerate and was out of sight within a fraction of a second. The next day on the local rock radio station KLBJ, they announced that if anyone had seen anything unusual the night before it was because the Air Force was testing something. I later became a weather technician for the Texas Air Guard and even though I was already familiar with most military craft I became an expert at recognizing all atmospheric phenomena and different types of aircraft as was required by my job. I do not believe nor have I ever believed that this huge, silent golden triangle was of a terran origin. I have only found one other witness online to this event who saw it 30 miles to the north of Austin and he stated that he saw several small shapes flying around the triangle as it headed south towards the Austin area.

I was busy getting linen,when I looked out on the grounds an saw a round object with a orange probing light. I watched it for a bit,when it stared to roll down the grass along the sidewalk a bit than stopped. So I went back to what I was doing.                                                                     When I got done, I thought I would go check it out an if it was a toy I would take it with me.                 I stared towards the object,when something told me to go back to my van, which I did.                          Once in my van I rolled up my window an started it up, an I sat there a bit an watched it. It turned towards me still rolling on the ground.             I started to move an made a turn, an the object rose up off the ground no higher than the window on the drivers side.At that point if I had le! t my window down I could have touched it, or it could have come inside the van with me < no thanks>             It was a bit smaller than a socker ball.   At that close range I could see it had like hawk wing spread out design all over it except for right in front were the pulsating orange light was comming from.          I took off an it started to follow me right behind my van.  When I got back to my building I didnt see it any more.                              Around 5:00am I saw a very bright light light out in the parking lot. I dont know if it had anything to do with the object I saw or not.                           A day or 2 later at the house where I live,there were 2 strange tornada shape things growing in my yard. I have never seen anything like it before. I had asked 3 diff people to come by and look to see if they knew what they were, but they didnt know either,they hadnt never seen anything like them before either               One of the person touch it and said ! it felt like it had a grease texture!  I know it sounds weird but I beleave it all had to do with the object I had a very close encounter with.              I have seen U.F.Os ever since I was a teenager an have never been scared an I have had some very close encounters with them.  But this was different some how.     The object made no sound.

      "story": "A Bluish-white object with glowing aura hurtles through the sky at great speeds As I was jogging westward along 53rd St. past the intersection of Rowena, I saw out of the corner of my left eye, a bright object hurtling across the sky, above the trees.  I immediately looked at it as it traveled out of sight behind trees.  The whole episode last 2-3 seconds, long enough to train my eyes on the object as it went out of view. What it looked like was a spherical bright object shrouded within a hazy fog or glowing aura, traveling at very fast speed.  The color of the object was bright white with a bluish tint, or more accurately, the sphere was bright white while the glow surrounding it was bluish-white.  It seemed, instinctively, like a meteorite flying through the air but there were things about it that made me question that possibility.  One, the trajectory was straight and level, not at an angle downward.  Also, the shooting stars I've seen in the past have always been bright and sharply defined, never one with a glowing aura surrounding it.  That immediately seemed very odd and out of place.  Plus, the time that I was able to view the object, 2-3 seconds, doesn't sound like a long enough time but compared to the shooting stars I'm familiar with, it's almost an eternity.  Not only that, it didn't feel like it was going to dissipate, or burn out, as it went behind the trees but rather to continue on its present trajectory. If I was to describe it's dimension and where it was within the environment, I would say it was roughly 200-300 feet in the air and was traveling at 100 MPH+.  (It could've have been higher but then the speed would have been amazingly fast.  I would stay with the original estimation.)  The object appeared about 3-5 feet wide while the glow extended outward 10 feet or so and maybe 15-20 feet behind.  That would seem to suggest a trail (or a tail) but I couldn't really detect anything like a vapor trail or smoke. If push came to shove, I would say it could've been a significant meteorite, if I had to say it was anything identifiable.  But the color, trajectory and the glow seems to conflict with that hunch. That's about it.",

Correction of date from 11/2 to 11/6/2010 From the passenger seat of our SUV, my wife observed an object in the sky, she called my attention to it, as I drove at about 20-25 mph through city streets near our home. What we saw was a very shiny, reflective, silver, metallic, mostly spherical object, with a somewhat smaller, delta shaped lower section at its base.  It appeared in plain sight, its skin and contours sleek.  The object was to our east, alternately moving through the sky from north to south and hovering.  We remarked to each other that this was nothing like the planes we often see in our neighborhood, which is on the local international airport flightpath. It also did not look like a weather balloon or anything like a balloon.  The weather was clear and there were few if any clouds and no obstructions to our field of view.  The object was moving at less than 1000 feet over the horizon, and its widest, its size was probably about 10-15 feet. I happened to have a camera in my vehicle, I reached ! to grab it so I could take pictures, we both turned away for a moment, but the object had disappeared as we turned to look at it again. The object's altitude was high enough that if it had been a conventional plane, we would have still seen it moving, either descending or ascending over the horizon, as any other plane that flew to or away from the airport. Moments later, looking out to the sky in the southwest, still in our general vicinity, we observed what appeared to be a delta shaped, bottom side of a flying aircraft, maybe a military fighter jet. The color of the bottom side of the craft was dark or perhaps black and the craft was moving fast at about the same altitude, moving from east to west and appeared to be banking sharply away to the south, in the direction of the international airport.

The craft had a solid white sphere on both the left and right sides and was held together by a thin black rod in the middle. The craft swayed as it flew at a moderate speed. A few minutes later, another identical craft followed the same route. As the hour progressed, up to 14 followed in the same area of the sky. No more than two flew over at a time. Toward the end of these sightings, a short rod-like object was sighted headed in the same direction, at the same height. It looked similar to a thread from a spider web. Two military jets were seen at an estimated 30,000 feet above the objects heading in the same direction, but it was unclear if the jets were aware of the object's presence. The last objects to be seen were small white dots that were spotted flying irregularly at a quick speed. They were much higher than the average commercial aircraft. The sightings ended just after 17:30 PM, three separate types of UFOs witnessed.",

My boyfriend and I were walking behind our house south-west of Austin when he saw something and immediately told me where to look. Due south and located initially in Sagittarius, we spotted two, tiny moving objects heading directly north. The objects were very close together from our perspective, and moved \u2013 one in front of the other \u2013 about three times the speed of a satellite. We had just seen a satellite about 15 minutes before that, so it was easy to make a speed comparison. Just about when the objects reached zenith, both of us realized the two objects moved closer together and then began moving around each other. This continued until they were out of view, about when they were between Draco and Cepeus.  There was no sound accompanying the fly-over.  Their speed remained constant, and were no blinking lights, though their position relative to each other changed. Their visual magnitude (apparent brightness) was a 4 or 5. The sky was pretty clear \u2013 there ! were no clouds.",

It was late at night.  I went outside to walk my boyfriend to his car.  He was much taller than I so when I hugged him goodnight I looked up towards the sky. There were a few deem lights on the property where we were standing.  As I looked up there was just enough light to show a very large rectangular metallic looking flying craft just above the trees.  There was just enough light to show the outline.  There was no sound and no movement of the trees despite how close it was to the trees.  The craft was very large and I saw no lights.  It did however block out the stars.  I never told anyone because I didn\u2019t think anyone would believe me.  I was so shocked I didn\u2019t even say anything to my boyfriend.  It was moving slowly, but would have passed behind the trees before he would have seen it.  I just said goodnight and went to bed.  I have tried to forget about it all of thes! e years, but after seeing all of the reports of sightings lately on T.V. and the history of UFOs, I felt I should at least let someone know.

From the passenger seat of our SUV, my wife observed an object in the sky, she called my attention to it, as I drove at about 20-25 mph through city streets near our home.  What we saw was a very shiny, reflective, silver, metallic, mostly spherical object, with a somewhat smaller, delta shaped lower section at its base.  It appeared in plain sight, its skin and contours sleek.   The object was to our east, alternately moving through the sky from north to south and hovering.  We remarked to each other that this was nothing like the planes we often see in our neighborhood, which is on the local international airport flightpath.  It also did not look like a weather balloon or anything like a balloon.   The weather was clear and there were few if any clouds and no obstructions to our field of view. The object was moving at less than 1000 feet over the horizon, and its widest, its size was probably about 10-15 feet.   I happened to have a camera in my vehicle, I reached to grab it so I could take pictures, we both turned away for a moment, but the object had disappeared as we turned to look at it again.   The object's altitude was high enough that if it had been a conventional plane, we would have still seen it moving, either descending or ascending over the horizon, as any other plane that flew to or away from the airport. Moments later, looking out to the sky in the southwest, still in our general vicinity, we observed what appeared to be a delta shaped, bottom side of a flying aircraft, maybe a military fighter jet.  The color of the bottom side of the craft was dark or perhaps black and the craft was moving fast at about the same altitude, moving from east to west and appeared to be banking sharply away to the south, in the direction of the international airport.

I then looked up and there were two lights in the sky, they reminded me of what a flare would look like in clouds but they were moving slowly and moving together at a fairly close proximity. They were a flickering yellow orange color with an orb-like appearance but maybe that had something to do with the clouds. I drove on home and lost sight of the lights but when I went in our backyard, there was another light in the sky. My husband also saw this one. It was not in the clouds like the first two. There were plenty of people here trying to figure out what they were looking at. It was close to dusk so possibly a reflection from the sun. Could not tell the altitude but we also saw a plane that appeared to be higher and it was clearly a plane.  These objects were in the clouds that seemed to be lower but like I said, it\u2019s hard to tell when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at.

Three witnesses, While driving on the south central side of Austin, MN. in front of the water treatment plan, I noticed in the WNW skyline 3 reddish lights, stacked on top of each other.  I thought it looked like cellular tower lights, but I was not aware of a tower in that area.  I then noticed the three lights were moving toward me, from the low horizon, to about 45 degrees off the horizon, to overhead.  As that group of 3-4 lights approached, the formation widened, and out of the same spot on the horizon, three to four more lights appeared, stacked like the others (looking like a radio tower).  I pulled the car over, assuming these were formations of military helicopters.  There were two other witnesses in the car. I stepped out of the car as the first group passed over head.  I was surprised that the speed was faster than helicopters would be traveling, more the speed of jet aircraft.  I am a private pilot, so have a good sense of speed and altitude.  The first group appeared to be at a higher altitude as they passed overhead than I presumed, when I originally got out of the car.  I would guess at 8,000 to 12,000 ft above the ground. As the first formation passed over head, the reddish color was now more of an orange color.  There was no sound, which I found to be odd.  The second group passed over about 10 seconds later.  Same course and speed as the first.  Then I noticed a third group coming up from the horizon, same spot.  I then got back in the car, drove about a half block north, turned west on the next street and pulled over to see if more were coming.  There were, no longer however in a formation (as the first three groups were).  Now they were coming in line, about 5-7 second separation.  I lost count of how many were passing over head in single file.  I am guessing we saw an additional 8-12 objects pass over head.  All at the same speed, same separation, course and same altitude. I noticed that the color changed from the initial view just above the horizon being reddish, to more orange as they approached  over head.   As they passed by, looking back the ESE, they were still orange, but a much dimmer and well defined spec of light.  As the approached, the red was as bright as a radio tower light, as they got closer, and over head, as bright, but an orange color. The night sky was clear at the time, and visibility of the stars was excellent.  There were no other lights on these aircraft, no red/green navigation lights or strobe lights, which I thought was odd, as even if these were military aircraft, they would typically have standard aircraft lighting on while flying in domestic US airspace.",

In addition, there was also another anomaly that preceded the main object which I feel was associated with it, although I cannot precisely place the 2 together. \u00a0These two facets make this a significant, extraordinary UFO sighting.\u00a0   Austin Tx 1986, Sunday afternoon between 4-5pm.  We had just returned from buying groceries to cook on my new outdoor grill.  So I was outside on my 2nd story apt deck at Sterling Village sitting down watching the fire and looking out due west at the beautiful bright blue sky, almost no clouds, just perfect central Texas sky.   Then to my left I see something dark in the sky at quite a distance in the SE direction that I assumed was a flock of birds.  I turned to look directly at the \"flock\" and observed peculiar spazzy \"wing\" movement, sort of like cartoon bats, not at all bird-like.  So the \"flock\" began to get bigger, not closer, and within a few seconds it became clear that it was not birds but, LARGE crooked zig-zagging dark LINES that were gradually spreading outward from a previously small central point, like a cracked windshield, only this was moving, vibrating.  I also could not quite determine just how far away these lines were since I had never seen anything like this before, but my guess would be several miles, at least 20 or so, about as far as the eye could see fairly clear.  I guess to describe it, it looked as if a sky-blue canvas was being ripped or torn at from the opposite side from me, with darkness behind it. As I recall at this time I could not really think as to what I was seeing; I mean my thoughts just stopped, like an overloaded PC \"freezing-up\".  Now I looked around and saw nothing else in the air but a few sparsely thin wispy clouds.  No birds, no planes, balloons, blimps, helicopters, nothing but still quiet blue sky.  As I looked back at the object(s?) only moments later, it was quite larger now, having at least tripled in size and branching out in long, spider-like appendages within a few seconds time.  It was also vibrating much faster and I was just dumbfounded staring awestruck.  I quite literally went blank for lack of any frame with which to reference what I was witnessing.  NOTE: You must understand that I DO realize this description sounds incredibly absurd,  I honestly do. I am only describing what this event looked like.  Please hear me out.  This is not a hoax.\u00a0  At this point I was really at a loss for even thoughts as to what this was, and by now I was getting nervous so I again glanced toward the western horizon, bright orange sun lighting up everything and as I turned to look back at the dark lines, a grayish blur INSTANTLY appeared in front of me maybe 800 to 1000 feet to my left at the lowest cloud level.  I stopped to look at it for a moment and almost instantly it changed in appearance and became a defined object, that is to say the surface and edges came into focus and the grayish blur changed \u00a0into a solid 3 dimensional object.   The object was a grey blur for only about 2 seconds but the transition from fuzzy-blur to definite solid object happened instantly.  I then remembered the \"dark lines\" in the sky and immediately after this grey object appeared solid I quickly glanced back at the sky toward the south east where the \"dark lines\" had been only to find they were completely gone.  No visible trace remained of that first anom! alous sighting at all.  As large and branching as it had become within less than half a minutes time it disappeared within a few seconds.  But I now had this other thing to look at. At first it resembled a huge ballon-like blimp from a parade float or something being that it was smooth. No parades in town today. I thought it might have been hiding behind a cloud.  A quick scan of the skies revealed no clouds even close to being large enough to have been able to conceal the object.  Within a few seconds, maybe 10 or so, I observed it did not have wings, jets, propellors, windows, lights, markings, nothing I could identify it with.  It was a glossy smooth blueish-dark brown-gray color, similar to that of the submarines I've seen on TV.  It also did not make any movement at all; none at all, like a huge dark semi-flattened jellybean perched upon a ledge it just sat there totally silent and motionless, slightly tilted downward towards my general direction. \u00a0Finally about this time I suddenly felt anxious as I finally realized this was not like anything I have ever seen in the sky (or anywhere for that matter). I was still reeling from what I had been watching prior to this object and I was VERY uneasy now. Austin at that time had Bergstrom AFB and I had seen at another time huge military cargo carrier jets circle the city to land at the AFB.  This object could have held inside of it at least a couple of those big planes.  Cliche as it sounds, easily this object was at least as big as a football field.  Easily. At this moment I called to my wife who was inside cutting up the chicken to grill. She told me to wait she was busy and I anxiously yelled for her to come outside right now!  She ran out looking down at the grill (she later said she thought I had burned myself lighting the fire, by the way I was yelling) and I bolted up out of my chair, grabbed her by the shoulders and pointed her towards the object in the sky and ranted, \"Do you see that?! DO YOU!?! Huh!? Answer Me! What is it?\" She was not excited like me.  She was calm and speechless, literally at a loss for words. I kept asking her if she could see it, what was it? and she finally whispered \"I don't know\".  We then heard a man yelling at us from the parking lot by our apartment. \"Do You See It?!\", he asked me.  Yea I see it! Do you?!, I responded.. YEA! WHAT IS It?!  He yelled at me and I yelled back  I Don't know!!! (In hindsight I thought it silly that I asked if he saw it too when he obviously had since he asked me first)  Now this guy was behaving even more excited than I was, he was jumping around and waving his arms, really losing it.  I guess looking for other people but nobody was around close by.  We then heard some yelling in the adjacent shopping center parking lot where several people were pointing in the air towards the thing and jumping and yelling.  My wife and I just looked at it quietly.  I suggested we study it in detail. (I have a bit more to say with regards to a more detailed description of the incident, also regarding my phone call to Bergstrom AFB; they denied having any planes flying in the area). NOTE: It is the two specific moments regarding the objects arrival and departure that completely distinguish this thing from anything then or now that I can think to compare it to.  I cannot emphasize how quickly this thing simply zipped into view, then zipped away silently, instantly, no sound, no light.  As my wife describes it, \"Just POOF! Gone\".  Sorry but i really have to use another cliche: If you had blinked your eyes you would miss it.   A bustling city all around and had you not looked up in the sky you would not know it was there.  I saw so many cars pass by on N.Lamar blvd, totally oblivious to this huge thing hanging less than 1000 feet above them.  Approximate location was just north of 183/research, between N. Lamar & Burnet Rd. Would gladly discuss more detail in reference to this sighting since we had a perfect viewing in broad daylight. I am old enough to recall as a youngster ( when kids used to play outside ) and quite often military jets from the nearby AFB would fly low and break the sound barrier. We always looked around to find the jet. \u00a0 At no time during this sighting did I hear any sound at all from either the craft which was WAY larger than any jet I've ever seen;  nor was there any sound from the anomalous object that appeared before it.  I have seen the Goodyear blimp from at least 3 times the distance further than this object and I could still hear it's engine. I've said more than you wanted to hear in this text I'm sure but as you might guess, this event forever changed my view on many things in this life.  Up until this 1986 sighting i had little interest in these things. I felt the Star Trek-Star Wars phenom had run its course.  Prior to this sighting and for 20 years afterwards I had virtually no interest in the ufo phenom.  My interest in UFOs has sprung up only in the last few years really after finding so much interest on the www. \u00a0   Again, I am sharing this with you for the reasons I stated earlier. I am also hoping to meet anyone who may have seen this UFO. I counted at least 5 people other than my wife and I whom I personally observed watching the object.  I would be especially surprised to find anyone else who witness the \"lines in the sky\" anomaly as well.\u00a0   My wife and I are both licensed healthcare professionals and we both have at least 15 more good years of service to mankind before retirement. I do not wish to discredit our reputations as they are in excellent standing in our respective specialty areas.  As I hope you can understand,  I do not wish to openly reveal our identities. \u00a0 My wife especially is in disagreement about discussing this event as she currently holds supervisory positions in and out of the hospital setting.  She dislikes talking about this even with me bec ause \"no one is going to believe it and even if they did, nothing will become of it so just give up on it\".   So I am sharing this with you all without her involvement.  I hope you understand our position.  However, I do hope to get at least one response from you soon.   Thank You. \u00a0 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Fleet of Flying Objects/Crafts - Austin, Texas - 01/13/2012 Location: Austin, Texas (North Central Austin) We are in the neighborhood south of Kramer Lane and between Lamar and Metric in North Austin.  Trajectory was from South to North. Time and Date: 7:40 pm approximately on 1/13/2012. Duration:  Approximately 5 to 8 minutes   Conditions:  Night, clear sky, no clouds. Setting:  My companion and I were sitting in our vehicle ready to back-up on to street.  Companion checking traffic to his right and noticed orange/red dot lights in the sky to the distance (coming North from South).   He looked again and said, \"What is that?\"    I looked and was also surprised to see orange / red dot lights that were moving towards North.   We exited the vehicle and walked South on sidewalk to better see coming lights (past our front neighbor\u2019s trees).  What we saw:   As the lights moved North, in what appeared to be two rows of lights, we were able to distinguish that there was a large \"mass\" craft at the front of the \"fleet.\"    This craft appeared to be very large and looked diamond-like.  It had red/orange circular lights at the perimeter;  about three or four appeared to be turned on and these looked like dots of light at the perimeter.   The fleet, including the larger craft, moved smoothly without sound (appeared to be moving fairly slowly and smoothly, but unsure of how fast.  It took about 5 to 8 minutes from when we noticed the lights, to when we saw the final light disappear). While it seemed as if the fleet was traveling below the height that a plane would fly, we are unsure of the actual size of the larger craft so we are unable to assess height of travel.  With an extended arm, and measuring with your thumb and index finger, the larger craft would be about 5 inches wide and about 1 inch high.   As the fleet proceeded on its trajectory, the larger mass object was now \u201cin-front\u201d of us.  We were facing west and the fleet\u2019s trajectory was South to North.  The larger craft appeared to be metal, dark and had textured surface (as if the surface was comprised of different levels).   The larger craft lights began to dim until they completely turned off.  When the lights turned off, we were still able to see the dark mass and that is when it was clearer that the surface was not smooth, but \"textured.\"  The larger craft was still very much silent and still moving toward North, when lights were all off and it continued behind my front neighbor\u2019s trees and then disappeared (or was less visible as if it either went higher, or simply further, I don\u2019t know). Behind the larger craft followed, what appeared to be, smaller crafts following in the same trajectory.   We do not know how many smaller objects were following, but we believe there were more than 5 (from 5 to 10 possibly).  The following crafts had a number of lights that dimed and then reappeared, so it was difficult to assess quantity.  The lights continued to pass in front of our vantage point until one by one, they began to slowly dim until they disappeared completely (similarly as with the larger craft).  The smaller crafts appeared to be smaller in size and so the surface was not clear as with the larger craft.

Related to my post \"Fleet of Flying Objects/Crafts - Austin, Tx - 01/13/2012\":   I pressed submit before I included that:  While my companion and I witnessed the fleet passing by, an individual walking toward us and said, \"What is that?

The light disappeared in the time it took for me to get to the window.  I went outside with a flashlight to discover where the green light had come from, but couldn't find anything and all.  The proximity to my house has me spooked.  We live a ways from the road, which is shielded by trees.  It is very dark outside, and we have no outside lights on. After I couldn't discover anything I went back to reading.  Then I saw it again outside a different window (the one next to where I saw the first light come from). I think I saw a cone shaped light towards the second circle, but I can't be sure.  As soon as I saw the second circular light it disappeared about 1 second later.  This time I had my husband go outside t! o check.  He didn't find anything. It has unnerved me a little, since there doesn't seem to be any simple explanation.

Physical appearance:  A bright green fireball with a long bright green tail.    The fireball was much bigger than any star but smaller than the moon.  The tail was almost as bright \u2013 and just as green \u2013 as the fireball.  There was no trail. Length of time:  I witnessed it for five or ten seconds.  Long enough to realize it wasn\u2019t a flare or fireworks because it never dissipated.  Eventually, it went beyond the horizon (tall trees about a block away).  I did not see it decrease in brightness. Trajectory:  I was facing north.  The fireball was heading northeast.  It seemed to be moving downward at a small angle, from my perspective about 25 degrees.  It appeared to be moving away from me, so it\u2019s hard to tell if it was actually falling towards the earth.  Basically, I saw it move across the northern sky until it disappeared beyond the treetops. Location:  I was at an outdoor seating area of a food trailer park on the 2200 block of East Cesar Chavez Street in Austin, TX.  About a mile and a half east of downtown and about four miles northwest of the airport. About a minute after I witnessed this, a low-flying helicopter zoomed overhead, from the direction of the airport, going in the exact direction I witnessed the fireball.  This might be a coincidence because I was relatively close to the airport.  I\u2019m confident of the time because I was on the phone when I saw it, and the time given above is from the call history.  There were about eight other people eating in this area, (along with some kitchen workers in the various food trailers) and two performing musicians.  Nobody else saw the fireball as they were all watching the musicians or working. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor, we suspect.  Video suggests a meteor to us.  PD))",

We had just regular 7x50 binoculars with us and switching those between us. There were couple planes flying overhead and we can clearly see them through the binoculars.  The skies were full of clouds and we could see the planes disappear into the clouds. Each plane was leaving a straight line of white steam from its wings. I was watching one plane to the north west when I saw a reflection of the Sun on some type of metallic sphere.  I only saw it for about 2-3 seconds as it passed at an angle where the Sun would have reflected briefly. However it was enough time for me to get the direction in which it was moving.  \tIt was already near a big cloud and it created what I can only describe as a set of giant smoke rings that were just being spread from what at that point appeared to be nothing. The observing conditions were perfect and since I was watching planes up that point I got a pretty good idea of the scale of that object.  It was at least as big as a 747 or slightly larger. This happened very quickly and I heard no sounds from that direction.  The distance between us and the object was about 15 miles.  My son saw the flash, but since I was the one looking through the binoculars he did not see any of the \"smoke rings\". Basically this looked like a giant mirror like chrome marble floating through clouds.  I've never seen anything like this before or since.  What is bothering me is that I have absolutely no logical explanation as to what that was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

Its bright white football shape quickly morphed into, what I can best describe as, a series of cotton balls attached to one another. It then began to writhe much like an amorphous earthworm. At the end of the object there was a small appendage that seemed to dangle separately, but it (the appendage) did not change shape. There was a &quot;fuzz&quot; surrounding the entire object that seemed to not allow proper focus (i.e. very few sharp edges or contrast). When it was at its closest, I thought I detected a pink hazy light, much like bio luminescence. And after a quick grab of my binoculars, the pink was obvious. Even after it had moved further away, I could see the pink light. It looked as though it was inside the object, and slightly outside the dorsal portion of it. It was silently moving from east to west, with surface winds approximately blowing at 5mph from the SSE. But at several points during the observation, it was moving into the wind. It seemed to be a controlled &quot;flight&quot; and not wind driven. Its height was below the low clouds that were drifting lazily by. What ever the cloud deck height was in Austin that day will give its approximate height. At one point there was a twin-engined small plane moving parallel to the object's position. As the plane moved closer, the object moved further away. Eventually the object simply disappeared. I observed the object for at least 5-minutes, but the first witness only saw it for a minute or so. I attempted to film it, but it doesn't show up on my camera. I did find a video of another observation that looks almost identical to what I saw.  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCEyDXYC2VM)",

While at a friend's house for a pool party, I happened to glance up at the southeastern sky and what I saw was unlike anything I'd seen before.  To my amazement, there was approximately 100 solid white lights moving very rapidly in formation in a northwesterly direction.  At that point I asked the group to look up and confirm what I was seeing.  Everyone was in agreement as to the description but no one in the 7-10 people there could explain what we were seeing.  The objects were moving at a high rate of speed (100+ mph) and there was no sound!  The formation was random with the objects following a consistent flight path.  As the group thinned, there were several small clusters of objects and finally, one was following at a considerable distance behind the others.  The large cluster and subsequent smaller clusters as well as the last few solo objects/lights traveled directly overhead, approximately 500-1500 feet directly above us as we watched in amazement.  The duration of the event was probably 20+ minutes.  As we watched the objects fade into the distance over Lake Travis or in that general direction, the sky began to get hazy with some low level cloud cover. We continued to watch the sky and probably 15-20 minutes after the initial event subsided, we glimpsed a similar formation much higher, above the haze/clouds traveling in the opposite direction. This time since the objects were much higher, they seemed to be moving much more slowly and at times appeared to stop. We eventually lost site of the objects/lights after about another 15-20 minutes as the cloud cover increased.  Conditions: clear sky, no clouds during the first period of sighting then low level haze/clouds during the last period.  We all snapped multiple photos with our phones and recorded video. Unfortunately, most photos and videos were way too dark to see any significant detail. I have posted the best two photos we captured. What we witnessed could not be explained that night and we still have no explanation.",

The porch light was turned off so I could get a better view of the sky.  It was lightly cloudy and the wind was at a light gust.  As I looked upward at the sky, I noticed a faint dark, grey haze that zoomed overhead.  The crescent shape (rounded side flying forward) must have been flying at least a thousand miles per hour to achieve the speed it was going.  It was out of view within a second.  The inner portion of the crescent had a slightly brighter grey hue that was almost difficult to distinguish from the color of the clouds, unless the object was in clear sky areas.  I assume that this was the propulsion agent burning off.  The object I saw was judged to be roughly 6,000 to 15,000 feet above the ground.  Judging the size of the crescent, its wingspan was roughly 800 feet.  This would make the length of the craft (from center of crescent, front to back) was close to 300 to 400 feet.  The thickness of the hull (top to bottom) was possibly 100 to 150 feet.  Its coloration was very close to the coloration of the sky itself.

They moved around erratically, and in particular would dip very suddenly, losing altitude quickly, then rise back up again, move around, then dip very fast again, and so on.  The best way to describe their movement was that it was similar to an insect flying, such as a fly or a bee, except for the very rapid descents and rises.    From time to time the intensity of their light would dim and then resume brightness.    After a few minutes the white light flickered off and was not seen again.   The red light continued its motions and would from time to time dissappear below the crest of a hill which was at least ten miles away.     I would estimate the red light was some distance further beyond the hill from my point, making it's brightness ! more than that of an aircraft light or lights.

      "story": "Craft videoed near daybreak near Austin I was using binoculars to search for the ISON comet in the northeastern sky.  The sky was evenly overcast with haze and reflected the city lights, and buildings blocked the lower northeast sky.  I gave up on the comet, and  noticed I could spot only four or five stars even with my sports binoculars.  I turned them toward the flight path  to our airport.  I saw a jetliners following the usual pattern, above the trees and apartment complexes east of my second floor balcony.     Maybe five minutes later I focused on another set of similar lights in the same direction and elevation, and because a white light was blinking and there seemed to be an orange light at the back and a bluish white light on the front, I assumed it was another plane.  I have a table and a chair on he balcony, and tipped the table  up on end and sat in my chair steadying my binoculars.  I realized that the object did not move relative to the roofs of neighboring  complexes.   That would mean! the plane was far, far away, and enormous, but repeated observation over about seven minutes convinced me that the object in the sky was not a jetliner and was not moving toward the airport at all. Daylight was coming soon, and I doubted that I could locate my digital camera and get it set up in time to photograph the unrecognized object, but I hoped that it could be done, and by steadying the camera and going to full 15x optical zoom.  I could get some 10 megapixel color videos to study at my leisure.  The binoculars are about 10x, but the images were fleeting and begged to be studied carefully. I took the camera off its tripod and rushed to the balcony. I hoped the batteries would last.  The warning screen on the back of the camera showed some red lines across the battery icon, and I know my time was short. I sat on my sturdy chair,  leaned the lightweight folding table against my knees, and did my best to locate the strange object using the view screen on the back of the camera.  It was a challenge, and the camera was unsteady.  The image on the screen was basically a black grey haze, and the craft was invisible.  With the naked eye I could see the craft and using a left of the table and a tree branch visible on the view screen, I aimed and shot several videos.  I finally stopped and rushed to get fresh batteries.  I changed from the view screen to the \u201cthrough the lens\u201d viewfiner.  At last I could see the UFO, and hoped that despite the shaking of the camera, I might capture at least a few images of the elusive UFO. Soon the sky was too bright for viewing the UFO, and I left the balcony.  It was about 6:30 AM and I had a lot of chores to do to prepare for a visit from a relative.  I finally got enough work done to allow me to slip the SD card into my desktop computer and chec! k my videos.  I was delighted to see that in the several videos I shot, a few second of \u201cUFO\u201d images appeared.  The shaky camera made it look like the UFO was zooming all over, but it was not.  With the naked eye, it appeared to be motionless in the sky.  I don\u2019t know if my UFO was actually a set of lights on a tall tower atop a distant hill, or an actual craft in the sky.  Because I have never noticed anything like this UFO in the 29 months I\u2019ve been in this city, even though I have been an avid airplane watcher for seventy years.  I was a Civil Air Patrol Cadet, studying at Randolph, Lackland and Barksdale AFBs in the 1950s and an aviation enthusiast the rest of my life. Upon examining the videos, it seems that the UFO was actually three or four lights, perhaps all attached to one hovering object.  On the right was a round, seemingly \u201cshattered\u201d white or light-greenish orb.  If the craft had been headed for a landing at the airport, the light on the right would be at the  \u201cfront.\u201d Additionally there was a red dot of fairly bright light below and on the middle of the bottom, and a dimly lit thin horizontal line of yellowish white light at the \u201crear\u201d where the vertical stabilizer would be on a jetliner.  When I first spotted the craft, there was a blinking white light where the red light appears in the videos, and I thought it was a regular aircraft strobe light.  Upon examination, I have not seen it. When I say \u201cfront\u201d or \u201crear,\u201d I am assuming the craft was aligned with the landing approach jetliners follow from north of the city to the airport on the south east. I\u2019m sorry that the videos are tedious to look at, but I don\u2019t know a thing about editing them to eliminate all the \u201cdead\u201d time. August 18, 2013",

They were orange in color and glowing.

The formation, or triangle, then receded into the fog and/or clouds.  The position in the sky was approximately 45 degrees.

I have five degrees from such schools as NYU, St. Mary's U San Antonio, Excelsior Colleges Albany, College of Santa Fe, with graduate work at USC, Boston University, Tulane, Xavier University New Orleans,! Loyola New Orleans and over a dozen other graduate schools. I have been an avid aviation enthusiast since childhood, was a CAP Cadet at Lackland, Randolph, and Barksdale Air Bases, and was a close friend of Col. Jeff DeBlanc, USMC WWII Ace with Medal of Honor and Adrian Conrad, engineer who help design and build the Army \"Jumps\" reconnaissance drones introduced in Desert Storm.  Both friends related UFO they saw. Jeff was warned never to mention his WWII encounter with a UFO. Today I was on my 2nd floor balcony observing the very display of numerous stars over Austin, where city glare and haze limit observable stars to a dozen or so every night. This morning at 5 AM I was viewing the eastern sky with large 10 power binoculars when a star of the second magnitude (brightness) appeared to be blinking with reds and blues in addition to its white light.  It was at 100 degrees East, elevation about 45 degrees, and with the binoculars it was like the thing I reported to your site about a week ago.  I took some clumsy videos that time, but was afraid I had taken photos of lights in the parking lot below my balcony, and because there were only short \"views\" of the supposed UFO lasting only moments during a long blank video, I did not edit or forward the videos. This morning, however, I made nine videos, and was able to zoom in with my 15 power optical lens and capture many seconds of continuous video images of the UFO blinking red, green, brown, orange, white, blue, and mixed colors.  I was forced to hold the camera in my hands, so the UFO seems to be jumping and zooming around, but that's due to my jiggling hands. What it did do was appear as if it were a blinking white star, but suddenly it would become an round image, as if it were holding up a red, brown, green or orange shield in front of itself.  The apparent disk shielding the UFO was solid color, or occasionally a dull color rimmed with red or orange.  It rapidly changed appearance, with the \"shield\" image seemingly closer and larger than the hidden image that seemed to be behind it. I will post all today's videos as Google files as soon as I figure out how to do that.  Maybe you can recommend someone who could coach me.  The files are on my SD drive with copies on my hard drive. My camera is now mounted on a tripod supported my a lightweight table on my balcony, and it the sky clears, I will try looking in the same place in the sky as I did last night, 100 deg East, about 45 deg elevation.",

      "story": "Small maneuverable craft w/ two blue-white lights over Austin, TX At 11:15pm on the evening of January 25th, 2013, at least three people witnessed an unidentified object maneuvering at a very low altitude, estimated to vary between 50 and 150 feet, near the corner of Duval and 45th St. in Austin, Texas.  We observed from an estimated distance of about a city block away, perhaps less.  The sky was dark but overcast, no stars or moon were visible. No other aircraft were sighted during the occurrence.  The object was most definitely mechanical, and intelligently controlled. My impression of the object's size was that it was equivalent to or somewhat smaller than a helicopter, but I am uncertain.  The most significant physical feature was what appeared to be two blue-white lights in close proximity that seemed to quickly oscillate with yellow, looking like headlights. (Though they appeared as headlights, their apparent brightness remained relatively uniform despite three-dimensional maneuvering).  Somewhat higher and slightly offse! t from these was a smaller periodically flashing red light, but this was only intermittently visible, due I believe to the face of the object that contained the flashing light being turned away as it maneuvered.  Because of the lights' brightness and the dark of night, the actual shape of the object was difficult to make out.  The object made no sound, of jets or propeller blades, and left no contrails. The object's motion was most peculiar.  It was capable of great dexterity and unpredictability, sudden acceleration and stops, hovering, and a very slow controlled vertical descent.  It would shoot off very quickly in a straight line, stop on a dime, hover for about 30 seconds, then perform a very slow zigzag, stop and hover again for a period, then dip and weave off to another section of sky and repeat similar motions. At two points the object stopped in air, hovered, then very slowly descended vertically to disappear behind the roof edge of the apartment complex on the corner. It remained unseen from our vantage point for about 2 minutes, then unexpectedly came zipping back into view. For the entire period of observation, the object stayed within the same area, roughly a square city block. It did not appear to be following any conventional search pattern, but instead behaved very erratically.  I was waiting at the corner for a bus when I first noticed the object, noting it at first for the unusual brightness of the light and its low altitude. As I began to take photos with my phone (unfortunately, the camera is low-quality), a youth also waiting at the bus stop noticed and began to take video with his smart phone. As we continued to observe and document, marveling to each other and trying to identify the object, its motions became more and more bizarre, as described above. About 5 minutes into this, a resident of the apartment complex came by, noticed and commented on the strangeness of the object as well, but didn't stay for more than a moment. After about 15 minutes, the battery on my phone had gone out, and the object had disappeared beyond the roof's horizon for several minutes. As I traded contact info with the youth, the bus came; I got on and left. I can confirm without reservation that the object I saw was neither a plane nor a helicopter of any type. I did observe a police helicopter performing a search later in the evening in a different part of town, and can report that the light patterns and motions of the two were absolutely dissimilar. I am a 29-year-old college graduate, history major. I work in education, helping to build websites for educational curriculum. I am not an active UFO hunter, and have never seen anything like this before. I don't know the fellow taking the video or his background, but he appeared to be about 18, and was just as flabbergasted as I was. The woman who observed in passing was most likely a college student, as that area is very close to the University of Texas. I am still waiting for word from the youth, hoping that he will send me the video to forward along. Unfortunately, the photos I did manage to get on my phone are pretty low-resolution, but if you zoom in on the bright blue object in the center of most of them, you will see the basic shape of the twin lights I have described.",

We watched them cross our visible sky within a minute and one in particular changed directions 3 times . Due north, due east, then due west.

My window faces to the South.  There are no lights out that way, so it is very dark since we are tucked into a dense ranch.  Being that my window is on the top floor of a 3rd story apartment, I can see above the tree lines. In the wee hours the morning of the 12th, I peeked out the window to check my van and weather before I went to sleep.  I was startled by a bright amber light about 1/2 a block away - maybe closer.  I opened the window to get a better view. The light was still and silent.  I even waved at it, and then I went to get my cell phone to video it.  When I returned, it was still there, and that shocked me.  I had half expected it to have left. I fumbled to see how to operate my new device, and eventually took a short video, but I was not sure if it was working.  I forgot about the light and the video till today. Had I seen what the video showed, I would have camped out to see \"them\" leave!  In the video, it shows several amber lights with white tinier ones behind the main one.  Off to the left - there were more, and I cannot help but think I was so concerned as to whether the cell was taking video, I did not see the entire picture of the outside sky.  I recall turning the camera right to left to pan, as my window is rather narrow, but it lasted only 17 seconds.  Now that I can see it, it appeared to be above and beyond my building hovering!  It sure looks like there is a hazy bright gold figure (full of light) just left of center of the \"main amber light\" in gold. (I would like to upload it if I can figure how to do that too.  I took a second video tonight for a perspective as to how dark it is out there!)",

Circular in formation, and appeared as if something was exploding, then disappeared quickly.   We ran outside immediately after and it was as if nothing happened.  No sound, no smell, no reaction from any neighbors.  More people have to had seen this...  It was such a huge display, I've never seen anything like it.   I'm looking for answers on what it may have been but there are so far, no other reports from this night.",

Approaching Bee Caves Road, I looked to the east over Zilker Park, and saw a series of red lights, most flying in a shallow \"U\" formation. Two of the approximate seven to nine lights were out of formation. The lights didn\u2019t seem to be moving or moved very slowly while staying very near each other.  I\u2019ve never seen aircraft fly so close together.  The number of lights caught my attention first and then the fact that they appeared so close together. The lights glowed a solid red and never blinked, as aircraft lights do. By the time we pulled into Zilker Park to watch, only three lights remained.  Slowly they blinked off one by one. About fifty yards away a man stood outside his car, dancing and screaming.  When he saw us he yelled, \u201cDid you see that?\u201d   My husband and I hurried to meet him and he said he had watched the lights for about ten minutes.  We saw them for about three to four minutes. The stranger, our new friend, said they first appeared on the southern horizon.  We both watched them travel to the southwest. He also said that twice he saw one light race to a second light and hover briefly before racing off at an unusually high rate of speed. My husband is sixty-seven and has practiced law for the last forty years.  I\u2019m almost sixty, attended graduate school and was a stay-at-home mother.

The night of the lunar eclipse I couldn\u2019t sleep so I went out side for a walk.  I wanted to see the eclipse, and it was a perfectly clear sky.  I sat in a chair on front lawn and watched and took pictures. I could see the planes going into Austin airport, very specific flight patterns. I saw a large disc form come from above left of the moon.  It came down and then around to the right of the moon, seemed to stay to the right for a moment or two and then took off at an angle to the left and up. When it paused near the right side of the moon it looked to be about 20% the size of the moon itself.  This was as the moon was finishing the eclipse at 5:55 AM, I put my camera on long exposure, but I shook a bit for that. I have been given what this was through communication with them, immediately upon looking at my camera that night/morning. My background:  I AM in communication with various ET\u2019s.  I have been most of my life, but never made this public before.  My parents, husband, daughter and extremely close friends know of this and have been present various times when this has happened. I have seen several ships in my lifetime.  Some recent dramatic sightings:  3 years ago at Enchanted Rock, TX, when we made it to the top and were resting,  I lay down on the summit and they (several) appeared for me.  It was late afternoon.  My husband was there and saw them as well.  There were no others around on the summit. 3 yrs ago in Galveston, I was sitting at poolside I was speaking on my cell to my friend back east, 2 AM, and a golden-brownish color ship flew over.  It was very low, just above the buildings.  I projected my thought to it \u2026 \u201cwait\u201d and it stopped, hovered, so I could get a good look at it, and then it flew on out over the ocean.  The friend I was speaking to also has communicated with ET\u2019s. 2 years ago and last year I was interacting with some Beings from the inner Earth.  There were 12, and they followed me when we went into the caves outside Austin.  I have pictures of that communication underground.  They came back above ground when I was outside one night at my daughter\u2019s house, very interesting. I attended and assisted for the entire week, the Paradigm Research Group at the Citizens Hearing on Disclosure, April/May 2013 at the National Press Club in DC.  I fully believe in the fact there are benevolent ET\u2019s close around Earth and in our immediate Solar System.",

The light  did not look like it was attached to the circle but  it moved at the same time the circle moved.  Then the circle disappeared.

      "story": "Car size Metallic round sphere seen out window by passenger of commercial jet over Austin, Texas I was flying to Puerto Rico with my girlfriend from wisconsin with a connecting flight in Austin I believe.  We took off from Austin and were ascending at an altitude of about 10,000 ft I would guess maybe a bit more since we're only about a minute and a half to two minutes in the flight.  I get nervous flying so I always need an isle seat so I can look out the window.  After a brief rest and trying to relax from the take off which is the most difficult time for me I decided I couldn't rest or relax so I sat up and decided to look out my window because this seems to get me out of my feeling state and into a visualizing state.  Well I look out and down to my left and there at about the 7 o'clock position and I would guess maybe 1-2 thousand feet below and about the same out away from the left side of the aircraft was a huge round metallic ball about the size of I would guess two Volkswagen cars on top of one another.  These are all fair guesses because without any! thing to compare it to it's kind of hard but the one thing I know for sure is the shape and color and the fact that it didn't belong there.  I always said I felt it had to be moving at a good speed because we were at lease it seemed not pulling away from it very fast.  I guessed we were traveling at about 350 still increasing and climbing so it's speed I would guess maybe at 200 because I did watch it for about 20 seconds until it was too far behind.  At the time I was not into ufo stuff so it wasn't a big deal but non the less I new it was odd and out of place. If it happened now I would be yelling for the others to look no doubt and I would be filming cause now I carry a camera.

Me and a friend where sitting outside when I seen what appears to be 2 single lights.  The lights where off in the distance but the way they were moving immediately struck me as odd..they were positioned cade corner from eachother .by the way they were moving in a way that caught my eye..I asked my friend what he thought they were and we watched the lights for about 5 minutes..we both threw out suggestions of what we thought it was..my best description was that it moved like a helicopter. After watching for a few minutes and calling my brother to come look at what we were looking at the 2 lights that appeared close to eachother a moved one left one right in a blink of an eye to either side of the sky.. My brother was spooked and went inside in a hurry.me and my friend stayed outside ..The lights were now accross the sky from eachother..The one that moved to the left appeared to be coming in our direction.the one that went to the right was farther from us and our attention was on the one nearest... We watched this single white light come closer at a very low speed.i couldn't see any shape at this point but from the way it moved and how low it was flying I knee something was very odd. Keep in mind.i do live by an airport and see planes all the ttime and never seen one move this wsy..The movement was more of a hover.the speed was very slow. we could tell it was coming towards the area we were at.i don't know the exact distance it was from us but it was getting closer and closer and we still didn't hear any noise coming from the object. My friend was then spooked and tries to run inside .I grabbed his arm and asked him to wait with me .We stood there another minute and it was getting closer to the point where I agreed and we both ran inside. As soon as I get inside my curiosity just starts eating at me and I ran back outside .I look towards where I last seen the object.nothing there.i look straight up in the sky and it was directly above me. It was a triangle shaped aircraft.i didn't see the white light anymore but red lights that lined the front in a v shape.the rest of the craft was pitch black. My parents property is is a little over an acre and this craft looked every bit larger ..it seemed to be so low I could throw a rock at it.it was completely silent and moving at a low speed.i was in shock or awe from what I had seen. One thing that I still don't understand is why I didn't see it fly away.i forget if I ran back inside or what I did.my mind was running a thousand mph it seemed. I just remember looking back up at it and didn't see it any more.there was no noise or vibration for me to look in its directiom.it was just gone. I started talking to the neighbors right after this took place when 2 jets with huge spotlights .I mean lights that lit up the land huge ,started flying in a big circle around this area. Never has anyone heard jets that loud fly so low or jets with massive spotlights on them around here. This was definitely an odd occurance.i mean those jets were odd due to the fact that no one has seen those either but the triangle shaped craft that flew directly over my mom's house without a sound was scary odd.it was like watching a paper airplane in the air.not a noise.

The sky was twilight but not yet totally night.   The object had a long glowing white tail like a falling star, but it had an red/orange (like it was flaming) area just before the tail in what I'll call the mid-section of the object.  Just in front of the red/orange are was a black portion which was the front of the object.  It looked rounded at the front.  It definitely looked like it was flaming-out (burning up as it descended) but it was not descending quickly but rather was moving in a leveled elevation.  I saw the white tail first, then the red/orange area appeared, grew more prominent then the entire object seemed to flame-out while moving very quickly in a rather straight line only descending slightly (not like a falling star but traveling leveled).  The object then disappeared.  I did not see it descend any farther, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

The noise started off low and increased in volume until we heard a loud \"boom!\"  It was so out of the ordinary that me and him expected to see light from an explosion and ducked down, ready to run the opposite way.  Instead, it got quieter, but the noise still continued.  We realized it was coming towards us and ran out to an opening in some nearby trees.  The sky was filled with low clouds and visibility was poor, but we were able to make out a trianglar shaped craft that was low to the ground, and made very little noise as it passed.  Yellow light was on both ends of the wings and in the center middle, like a circle.  The craft was dark gray or black.  We were only able to catch a glimpse and it was gone soon after. It's not common to hear aircrafts flying by so low and so quiet, and to fly directly over his house.  We have never seen anything like it again.  We know there is an air force base in San Antonio, but it was unlike any other plane we have seen so far.  All other planes that we have spotted in the sky at that time of night are very high up, loud, and have only red and blue lights.  This craft was much closer.

      "story": "2 Orange lights and a giant white circle spotted in Austin, TX My friend and I were sitting on a rather higher spot in our neighborhood to gaze at the stars and just hang out.  After about a half hour of us talking about random stuff, I noticed a bright orange star looking thing at around 5,000 feet altitude..  But much bigger than a star.  When I first saw it I knew it couldn\u2019t be a plane or a shooting star, it was too big and too bright to be either of those.  I pointed it out to my friend with a little alarming tone, and he shook it off as a plane. I tried to explain to him that it just couldn\u2019t be a plane and he began to believe me after the object moved about 6,000 feet and vanished.  Now we we\u2019re both at an alarming state.  We stared at the sky after that non stop and in a few minutes.  It re-appeared in its original location and did the exact same thing.  Moved a bit more this time and soon vanished again.  Now we knew we weren\u2019t imagining stuff.   1 minute later, I spotted a huge bright white circle at about 2,000 feet altitude zooming past at immense speed. It immediately grabbed my attention and I showed my friend.  We watched it fly across the sky until it dropped past the horizon.  This thing was giant!  It\u2019s not possible this was a balloon or any other man made substance...it just doesn't make sense.  Meteors aren't that big and neither are comets.  And I'm sure at that low altitude it would be on fire.  But not a perfect circle.   We have no explanation for either of these strange incidents but one more thing happened, soon before the white circle went out of sight a white firework light up at the opposite side of the circle without any sound which was kind of coincidental but I\u2019m not sure that was anything of significance.  I know the circle didn't make the firework because it wasn't in the same location.  It just wouldn't have made sense.",

      "story": "Cigar (?) shaped object with roughly 7 dim lights flies over North Austin It is 4:28 AM as I type this right now. At approximately 2:45 A.M. I decided to go for a late night walk on a nature trail near Walnut Creek in Nortwest Austin.  I stepped outside my front door and noticed an acrid smell, which I would describe as being like burning copper wires.  I could smell it for several yards until I got near to the trail, where the only thing I could smell was soggy Juniper and Live Oak bark. While heading back home after a walk up the trail, I noticed something in my peripheral vision in tne sky, at 3:32 AM.  I looked at it for 5-8 seconds. It was a very long, thin, and dimly-lit dark object with roughly 7 distinctly spherical lights on it.  I watched it fly across the sky and out of view (trees obscured my vision).  It appeared to be dropping lower as it zipped across the sky. I have no training in how to discern the size and distance of objects that are far away, but my intuition tells me it was roughly 1200 feet in the air, nearly a half mile away, and maybe 400 feet long. I must emphasize that this object was very dimly lit and that it would have been very difficult to see it the sky wasn't cloudless, and the moon as bright as it is tonight.  It was a very bright night.  The lights on this object were like weak LED lights. The object was moving from South to North at around 300-400mph over Walnut Creek Metropolitan Park and headed toward 1-35.  I was located near the St David's Medical Center building on the railroad tracks. I am 100% certain this was not a plane because it made no noise at all. The moment I saw the object I got an ominous sensation and the hair on my head and body stood up.  After I lost sight of it I immediately ran out of the trail and on to Park Bend Dr, and sprinted home. I would describe this object as being more like a drinking straw than a cigar.",

I rushed outside to the front of my house, and only witnessed two of the craft.  For less than 30 seconds, I saw one each of a set of red, blue, and green blinking lights on each craft arranged in a triangle shape.  They were flying to the east of my house on a North or NW path.  I did not hear any engine sounds.  They may have been about three miles away and 1000 feet or higher. I ran back inside my house and told my wife about the craft, and we ran into the backyard in time to see the two crafts pass further to the north in about twenty seconds, when they passed out of sight into the light cloud covering.  My wife only witnessed the two craft  from the back just before they disappeared.  She could only discern the red lights.  She did not hear any engine sounds either, but she said if they were normal, identifiable craft, she might not have heard any sounds anyway from that distance.. I spoke to my neighbor again and that is when he confirmed that he and his wife had estimated about a dozen ships flying to the east of his house.  His house is about one block from our house.  The craft never flew directly over our houses but may have moved near our area as if they came from the airport to the east of us.  The direction they were headed after we last saw them, if they stayed on that path, would have taken them directly over the city. We did not get to take any video or images. Just as the crafts dissapeared from sight, some type of passenger sized plane flew directly over our house from east to west.  It appeared about 2000 feet higher than the other craft.",

Right out my front windshield.   I immediately radioed my wife (we had picked up some 2-way radios for the trip) and said, \"Quick!  Look in front of us at that shooting-...\".  I didn't finish my sentence because as I was speaking, it began to slow down without fading.   It then came to a stop, pulsated or barely flashed (not very bright, though) and then another one appeared to the right (east) of the original light/object.  About a second later, a third one appeared (again, on the right) and now there were three of them! in a line.  Almost like Orion's Belt.   About a second or two after the appearance of the third and final light, the original one disappeared (like someone turning off a light switch), then the second one followed suite.  The third one, however, made an arcing maneuver towards where the original light was and then disappeared.   My wife (who is going to file a separate report) came over the radio and said what I was thinking, \"That's not a shooting star.\"  About 10 min later (19:25 or so), I saw a single and same amber/orange light I had seen previously.  This one was higher in the sky; where I had to lean in towards the steering wheel and look up out the front windshield (it seemed to be from the same part of the sky as the original sighting).  This light, however, was very active.  It moved, pretty rapidly, in a horseshoe pattern (from west to east) and then started heading back west before I lost sight of it directly above my truck.   Right after its horseshoe maneuver, I saw a white light (a lot smaller than the amber one) shooting from east to west at an incredible speed, where it disappeared near an aircraft (it was slow moving with the usual green/red blinking lights) that I hadn't noticed until that moment.  I tried to look out my mirrors to see more, but could only see the aircraft.   I radioed my wife during this second sighting as well.  She'll be submitting her report shortly.

      "story": "Flying orange ahead of Echo I in 1960. After Echo I was launched on August 12, 1960, many people subsequently enjoyed watching it pass overhead at night.  The newspapers in Austin, Texas, reported good times to see it locally, so my parents and I went out to our back yard to watch it about 9pm, one night later that month.  I was eight years old at the time. Less than five minutes before Echo I was scheduled to appear, we all saw a medium-dull glowing \u201corange\u201d pass silently across the sky.  The object\u2019s apparent size resembled that of a pencil eraser at a distance of about six feet.  Its angular velocity across the sky was several times faster than that of Echo I, which appeared on schedule perhaps three or four minutes later; the object crossed the entire sky in a few seconds (circa four seconds, as I recall).  Its path through the sky was quite close to the path that Echo I followed a few minutes later, and both objects were traveling in roughly the same direction (SE to NW).  Its appearance (including color, brightness, size, and shape) never changed until it disappeared from sight behind some trees.  There were no sparks, tail, visible structure, or other details. We phoned the weather bureau at the Austin Municipal Airport to report the sighting, and were told that many other citizens were also phoning in their reports.  The local newspaper ran a small story on it the next day (on the front page, as I recall), and reported that hundreds of citizens had phoned in their observations to the police department, the local Bergstrom Air Force Base (SAC, subsequently closed), etc.  The object was thus high enough to be seen all across the city.  I always guessed it was a meteor, except it was slower, redder, and duller in appearance than any other meteor I have ever seen or heard of, and did not change color, shape, or brightness throughout its flight.  No explanation was ever reported. Note:  The Austin Statesman was the evening newspaper to which we subscribed.

It was shaped like an upside-down saucer and it had a clearly metallic surface, like brushed aluminum.  It wasn't wobbling or tumbling or anything like that, just a very smooth controlled descent.

      "story": "Needleship?  Bright straight line of light over Austin, Texas. I was out on my patio deck smoking a cigarette, looking to the east, when I noticed a line of light, like a bright needle floating in the clear blue sky.  It was so high that I could see no details, and I don't think I would have seen it at all if it had not been perfectly perpendicular to the direction of the sun, whose light reflected brightly from its entire length.  Holding a ruler at arms length, the needle measured between 3/4\" to 1\" long. At first I thought it might be a jet, but all I could see was that single line of light, very straight and bright, no other details at all --no wings, no curve, and barely moving.  Yet a commercial jet's wings are approximately as wide as the jet's fuselage, and there were no wings visible, nor any interruption of the straight line of light where wings ought to have been. It was moving so slowly across the sky it appeared to be barely moving at all. I continued to watch it for about ten minutes, until the angle between it and the sun had finally changed enough that it no longer reflected any light in my direction. I'm an engineer who has flown commercially many times.  I know about how long a city block appears to be from cruising altitude -- tiny!  I also know how to calculate image length versus distance. So if this aircraft was at normal jet cruising altitude (7 miles), then it was at least 1100 feet long, more than four times the length of a Boeing 747 commercial airliner. Yet its apparent velocity was so slow that it appeared to be moving barely as much as its own length each minute, while jets cruise at 175 times their own length per minute. To stay aloft with wings at that height, it would have had to move at least 22 times its length per minute. So if it was human in origin, it could not have been flying with wings.  Therefore, it must have been in orbit. But if it was in orbit, then just how big was it?  That depends on how far away it was. If it was in low earth orbit (1,200 miles) then it was at least 37 miles long.  Which strains credulity.  Also, it moved much more slowly than any LEO satellite I've watched in the night sky.  But if it was just below geostationary orbit (22,000 miles) - say, at 20,000 miles?  -- Then its actual length was at least 625 miles long.  Which is ridiculous.  More -- In order for its surface to reflect enough light to be seen in full daylight, it must have been a mirror-bright cylinder.  And in order for that cylinder to have a wide enough surface for the reflected light to be very bright and obvious in full daylight, its width must have been at least 5% of its length.  Back of the envelope -- a craft only two miles long and 500 feet in diameter, with inner shells 20 feet apart, an inner core 100 feet in diameter, and assuming that the outer surface of each shell is the \"floor\", has over 100 MILLION square feet of space.  Depending on how efficiently the ecosystem is organized, a ship two miles long could easily support 10,000 people, perhaps even more if the decks are closer together and the food/air/recycling farm fills its decks from floor to ceiling.  If the ship was actually 50 miles long and 2.5 miles in diameter with a core that was 0.5 mile wide, then it had 264 decks 20ft in height, with a total usable area of 62,000 square MILES.  The outermost deck all by itself is 392.5 square miles.  If the inner core were dedicated green space, it would provide over 78 square miles of park-like grounds.  The line of artificial suns running through the center to light the core park would be 1,300 feet overhead -- about the height of the Empire State Building.  Ridiculous for any purpose except colonization.  So, let's assume that it had anti-gravity to keep it aloft and stationary.  In that case it could have been at any height, though for the sake of discretion it would have made sense to be well above airliner cruising altitude.  In that case it might have been only 15 miles high, less than half a mile long, only a few hundred feet in diameter, less than 10 million square feet of decks, maybe a third of a square mile. Bear in mind that all the above calculations are extremely conservative.  In every case of \"between low A and high B\", I chose A or less rather than an average of A and B.

      "story": "Two Red Lights with Blinking White Lights Over Austin, Texas I first noticed a single red light in the northwestern sky, about midway between the zenith of the sky and the horizon.  The light was steady and barely moving and was immediately unusual.  The light then began to move to the west quite quickly and steadily.  It continued like this, but in an unusual flight pattern, not like the normal ballistic trajectory of commercial aircraft.  My immediate thought was that it was a helicopter.  It would move west, then appear to pause (perhaps moving away or towards me) and then continue moving again.  It was hard to gauge its distance, but I\u2019d say it was 10-15 miles away.  If that is true, then it was moving far faster than any helicopter I\u2019ve seen fly at that distance. As it approached the western horizon, the red light changed to a white blinking light.  This light was blinking regularly, so once again I thought it must be a helicopter.  But at the speed it was going I began to think it was a fighter jet.  It was just about at the horizon when it nearly disappeared and immediately another separate red light appeared just to the right of it.   This red light was steady and even brighter than the first.   The second red light began to move to the north as the first was nearly gone. The second red light was moving toward the north and just suddenly, what I presume to be the first light, reappeared now as a red light with a white blinking light.  The two began to make their way northeast irregularly; sometimes moving steadily, sometimes pausing or moving away from me.  The first red light seemed to now be following the second, and when they were moving laterally, they were moving quite fast.  The only thing I know of that could move that fast at that distance is a jet fighter.  But the maneuvers between steady lateral movements were far too acrobatic for a jet fighter.    In less than thirty seconds, the two lights\u2014both with a steady red light at what I perceived to be the front, and a white blinking light at the rear\u2014cruised to the northeast and then quickly approached the northern horizon.  Through trees I saw them pausing at the horizon as red lights and then disappearing below the horizon, not to reemerge again.",

      "story": "Huge Triangle shaped craft seen with lights coming on and off, possible lost time, weird anomaly of not talking about it at the time. Female friend and I were standing on her porch in a very rural area near Austin, IN, (between Austin, IN and Crothersville, IN) around 11:00pm in the fall of 1994 in the fall.  We were talking and saying goodbye, and all of a sudden we saw 4-5 white lights come up to the south east.  I originally thought these were helicopters since I saw round white lights shining down and I attempted to make it fit my reference frame, as we have had helicopters looking for pot, etc in that time \u2013 the problem was it was night time and there was no way they were really doing that at night.  Also, there were no sounds \u2013 I\u2019d never seen a helicopter that made no sound \u2013 I thought in my head this must be special military aircraft.   I then was trying to look closely and finally the lights went out.  Then all of a sudden, lights came on the southeast area and the straight east,  shown above the tree line across the road from the house, 5 or more round white lights were shown.  I looked closely, again, trying to understand the context of the lights, they began to change color \u2013 purple, green, yellow, white, etc.   She and I never spoke.  Then, the lights shifted, turned white, and shone up and I was able to see that this was a huge craft.  Triangle shape and very large \u2013 length and height.  As the lights shined up on the craft, it looked like landscape lighting shining up on a very large building and was above trees at a height over 70 feet I assumed 500 feet long.  As I looked closer, I saw this craft was huge as the lights shown up the sides and showed the huge shape \u2013 my frame of reference was the tree line.  After a short minute, the craft moved forward (south) and I could see the triangle shape of the monstrous building size craft more clearly.  Then the lights went out and I could not see the craft any more.   Then small white lights came on and they moved on (about 5-10 of these) and move on south \u2013 the triangle craft was gone and only the ligh! ts left \u2013 like they quickly shot out of the craft then the cra! ft was g one leaving the lights.  Like the craft disappeared or turned into the small lights.  The lights then blinked out and then disappeared to the south.  I then regained my senses and looked at my friend.  She was still \u201cfixed\u201d on the scene and didn\u2019t respond to me.  I looked at my watch and looked for any missing time, but didn\u2019t at that time detect any.  But, I did notice that it seemed like I had a \u201cbad edit\u201d ( I heard that in a later discussion) because I really was lost for a minute.  My friend and I then went back to talking like nothing happened.  We did not mention it.  I then drove back to my house a few miles away, and checked my watch again looking for any lost time.  I didn\u2019t notice any.  When I got home, I called her and said \u201cDid you see that?\u201d  She then said to me, \u201cDid you see that, too?\u201d  It was so odd that we both ignored it at the time although was very profound, but then noticed the importance later.  As I heard the description of sightings or abductions as \u201cba! d edits\u201d, this fit that description exactly.  Although I have had other memories, this is the detail I remember in general.  Sorry it took so long to report.  Again, I can\u2019t explain why I haven\u2019t.  I did tell my sister about it the day after it happened and she remembered our conversation.",

Almost like a faint constellation floating across the sky.   There were airplanes in the sky going from West to East towards the airport.  The UFO looked like it was at a lower altitude than the planes.  I would guess that it was maybe 20 feet across, but hard to tell since I don't know how far away it was.  Even though it was moving in a steady straight line, it seemed almost organic (but I can't figure out why it 'felt' that way.  The only rational explanation I can come up with is a B2 bomber flying with no lights and the engines silent.  But why would it be flying over the city?

It flew towards Edwards Creek Valley but suddenly folded its wings, became nearly invisible and pointed straight up.  It continued to fly straight up into the sky until you could no longer see it.",

      "story": "Small silver circle object seen high in the sky not moving during daytime also seen a strange transparent plane flying around it Small silver ball object in the sky during the day.  It clearly looked like a small white dot in the sky but this was at 10am in the morning.  It was just very high in the sky not moving. It was a clear day so it stood out.  But it was hard to see it because it was small exactly like a star.  Also seen a transparent plane flying high in the sky.  It was going at a fast speed and I never seen a plane like that.  Only seen the plane for about 5 seconds than I couldn\u2019t find it in the sky after that.  It looked like maybe it was flying around or near the object in the sky!     At first I didn\u2019t pay no attention because I didn\u2019t want to think it was a ufo at first.  I was assuming it was a plane or balloons.  10 minutes later were still talking and I\u2019m still looking at this object above in the sky not moving.  I get my cousin to look in the sky and see if he sees it too and we\u2019re looking into the sky as I can see it clearly but I\u2019m trying to get him to see it too because he couldn\u2019t see it with his vision.   While I\u2019m trying to get him to spot out the object, I also spot what looked like to me a transparent plane flying high in the sky too, this plane looked strange like I never seen before because of its speed and how high it was in the sky.   I got my phone and recorded the other object and zoomed in on the object but it\u2019s hard to identify what it is.  It just looks like a white dot in the sky.  Obviously not a plane or drone because it was too high in the sky and not moving.  We recorded the dot for about 5 minutes as it just stayed in the sky not moving.  We lost sight of it and couldn\u2019t find it in the sky.  This was a really trippy morning because we couldn\u2019t really identify what it was.",
