Cluster of 6 very bright blue lights heading from west to southeast, followed shortly by one more.  Camera only picked up the bright blue lights, but visually I saw what looked like a balloon or some other object with the blue light hanging below it, maybe 20-50 from a cable feet.   Could be a school or festival event, but the object were traveling far faster than cars on a freeway.  Light breeze, but objects were traveling at least 60 Mph if not faster.  No sound from the lights.  Passed overhead maybe at least 200 feet.",

      "story": "On the night of April 13th or very early April 14th at about 2 am some unexplainable events began to unfold. First, my wife woke me up because while out on a drive she noticed a bright light in the sky, similar to a star, but slightly brighter...this thing was moving back and forth, up and down, a figure 8, just erratic.  Not super fast usually, fairly subtle mostly to the point thay when I first looked I didn't notice. So, I blow it off and start talking and looked away and she insists I look again.  When I looked back it truly WAS moving erratically!  I could not think of any possible thing that would move like that.  As I stare in awe I begin to adjust my eyes and notice at least 6 other lights but these ones were slighter dimmer than the stars.  They were darting back and forth it seemed!  I pulled my phone out hoping I could use the zoom to see better what was going on.  My phone camera wouldn't pick up the stars or the dimmer lights I mentioned but clear as day you can see the larger light in the sky on the camera.  I have video.  Through the phone camera zoomed at 8x(max) it looked like it was spinning, like looking through glass, and pulsed every once in awhile which in the video seemed to make it disappear for a couple seconds every 15 seconds or so. It stayed in the sky for hours drifting slightly to a different spot of the sky over time and continually moving in unexplainable ways. If I had only seen this, as weird as it was, I would not report it.  However, while this was happening and we're staring at the sky at about a 45\u00b0 angle, we witnessed something completely unexplainable and in my mind worth reporting. The sky seemed to have gotten darker out of nowhere...we both felt \"weird\" and hard to explain but it felt like a void, and a temporary breathlessness.  I had the urge to look up because it looked like something was going to fall on us. It appeared of nowhere and I almost wanted to move out of the way.  Then it just floated there for a second like a blimp flying.  It looked like 5 engines or cylinders all attached and white or silver in the shape of a V.  It didn't make a sound and was either car sized or jet sized. It was hard to tell how far up it was because it was so fast and scary.  It honestly was more like an absence of sound and then it took off at unprecedented speed after gliding or hovering for 5 seconds or so. Our best guess as crazy as I know it sounds...is that a portal opened up and a ship came through.  I had chills.  I would have never heard it if I hadn't seen it and wouldn't have been looking without seeing the star looking ufo's so I feel like it must be connected but idk.  I just don't want to feel like i'm crazy so I need to report it.  My wife saw all the same stuff and felt the same way at the moment that this ufo appeared.  We wont ever forget what we witnessed.",

I am a self-educated software engineer, and I now own a software development company based in Austin, Texas, developing high-speed machine vision systems for clients all over the U.S.. Description:  A formation of 3 lights, appearing in the sky above a ridgeline, with mechanical and precise motion. I was in my backyard after carrying several buckets of coal to the basement for our fireplace.  I was looking westward along a mostly flat ridgeline approximately 7 miles away.  From the north end of the ridgeline, noticeably well above the ridgeline itself (i.e. in the sky), a single light emerged, moving at a relatively slow speed.  Once it had moved along for a few seconds, a 2nd light appeared in trail behind it, emerging from the same location the first one had. The lights continued to move southward, in lock-sync, above the ridge until approximately halfway across.  At that point the lights stopped, in a very odd, mechanical fashion (i.e. there was no deceleration, just instantaneous cessation of movement) and immediately a 3rd light appeared from \"behind\" the southern-most light and stopped at a symmetrical point with the other 2, forming 3 lights in a straight line and spaced equidistant from each other. The lights sat there motionless for approximately 10 seconds.  At that point, the new light continued southward, and the original 2 lights retraced their original path northward, and all disappeared behind neighboring hills.  The motion again was completely mechanical; instant acceleration and completely synchronized. The lights themselves were single-point white lights, with no other observable characteristics. ((personal data deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed quite sober-minded to us.  That fact, combined with his technical background, suggests to us that he probably is an excellent witness.  He provides a diagram, which shows the motion of the objects he witnesses.  PD))",

      "story": "1995 Phoenix SE Valley \"shooting star\" turns 90\u00b0 and crosses sky in couple of seconds. I stepped out onto my patio around 10 pm because I'd heard there was to be a bit of a meteor shower and I wondered if I could see any of it from my somewhat rural location.  The sky was full of stars but I wasn't seeing much in the way of shooting stars, so after a few minutes I was ready to give up and go inside. That's when I noticed a star moving very fast from east to west across the sky. By my estimation it could have crossed the entire sky in 5 or 10 seconds. At first I thought maybe it was a satellite.  I've never seen one before but it just popped into my head that must be what this is, and I remember feeling a bit proud of myself for figuring it out.  At least that seemed like a pretty good guess until it got about 75% across the sky moving due west when it suddenly turned north and just took off so fast it was across the sky in a couple of seconds and gone. I don't know much about space but I don't think satellites can turn or move like that, so for me - this was a UFO.  It was flying and I couldn't identify it, put it that way.  Like probably millions of people, I never told anyone about it.  It's not dramatic or exciting but sometimes I wonder how different the world view would be if everyone who's seen a UFO would submit a report and I couldn't keep refusing to report my sighting with that thought in my mind.  Date and time are approximate, sorry but it was over 10 years ago now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

This is for cross reference purposes to note more than one witness to this visual:  Description: My daughter called me stating that the local radio, 97.8 FM (website has audio recording of it) is talking about 11 to 16 disks in the sky above Chandler (she was driving to work and couldn't see). I went out my front door talking to her and initially looked in the direction of Chandler, NW, to try and see what she was talking about. Didn't see anything and joked with her about needing to drive into Chandler to try and observe what the radio was talking about. Said good byes. I then went back out and leaned on my Honda roof and slowly started to scan the sky in the direction of Chandler. I then came across 2 white/shiny disks/orbs at about a 35degree angle. They were side by side with about a pinky width between them. I then continued scanning the skyline, due to the reported 11 to 16, and ended up observing 7 more white/shiny orbs/disks at about a 45 degree angle that stuck out against the clear blue sky. This second set of obrs/disks were in 2 groups. One group of three were in a triangle pattern while the other was in a box formation (one orb/disk in each corner of a \"box\" and a \"triangle\" formation. Ran in and told my wife (which she just laid there) and then grabbed the camera and proceeded to take 40 pictures with my Vivitar, vivicam 5386, 3x zoom f=5.4-16.2mm. By this time my wife walked out to see what I was talking about (her eyes were still adjusting to waking up, and didn't see anything). She advised I should wake up my 8yr old to have her come look. During the whole time of observing, I was quit elated that I FINALLY got to see things in the sky. My eyes kept feeling wierd, trying to adjust on such small objects.

There were two steady white lights with blinking red light equidistance in between them.

The object was about the size of my thumb to the second joint held horizontally at arm\u2019s length, that was the width of the object.  There was absolutely no sound.  The object moved in a slow and gliding motion towards the west and slightly northwest.  At first I thought it might be a plane, but it had no flashing red and green wingtip lights and no sound.  Also the lights didn\u2019t look like a helicopter and again there was no sound and it had that gliding motion.  I lost it behind the trees, it was that low and then caught a glimpse of it again further away and more to the west and slightly northwest but then lost it again behind the buildings. I did not see it emerge from behind the buildings so it may have turned more northerly or it may have descended even further.  I went back into my workplace.

On Saturday October 9, 2010 in Gilbert AZ I was outside playing with my five year old nephew when I looked up in the sky to see what appeared to be a star in the sky. It was around 5:38 PM and I thought that this was odd because the sun wasn\u2019t to set till about another 20 minutes at 6:01 and the sky was clear blue with plenty of sunlight.  I thought it might be a planet so I ran inside to get the binoculars. I came back and located it again as it was the only odd light in the sky. When looking through the scope it appeared to be a circular disc-like object that had a weird reddish light mixed with white light around it that appeared to be changing color. It was stationary and did not have the blinking lights of a plane. I then ran inside to get my father and we got another set of binoculars. I couldn\u2019t find the first object that I saw as it had moved. We then saw four distinct lights in the south southeast sky that had the same appearance as the first.  All four of them were stationary without blinking lights of a plane or movement of a satellite. With the naked eye they looked like faint stars in the sky but once again this was very odd as it was blue sky and before the sunset.  When they were magnified with the binoculars we both were able to see circular disc-like objects. I saw the same red and white lights that were around the first one almost like an orb or aura and appeared to change colors. My father only saw white lights when he looked but clearly saw the circular disc shape of the objects as I did. Three of the objects were in a line and the fourth was up and to the right of the other three. The objects stayed in the sky for around five to six minutes and then they were just gone! . I checked my cell and it was 5:45 PM still 16 minutes before sunset. If they were stars or planets they would have gotten brighter as the sunset occurred but this was not the case as they vanished after observing them for six minutes. They were not a plane or satellite because they did not move or have the blinking lights.",

Me and my kids were driving and four round bright orange/red lights swiftly moving across the sky caught my eye.  I was amazed and my kids looked up to see what I was looking at and they were also amazed.  There were four bright lights, which seemed to be round.  They traveled across they sky in a group and then they came to a stop.  They stayed in the sky for about a minute or less then gradually, one by one, they started to dim until each one disappeared.   I have a picture but it was much clearer in person.  When I zoom in on the picture, they look like orange upside down question marks without the dot.  One of them looks white because it is disappearing but it is the same shape as the other three.  It was night time and they seemed to be as high up in the sky as stars but they were bigger than stars.

My wife ((name deleted)), my son ((name deleted)), and I saw a mysterious phenomenon last night at approximately 8:30 pm. The attached pics and vids are taken from our front yard looking directly south. The property is located just northeast of Elliot and Val Vista Roads in Gilbert.  Initially, we saw an object streaking in the southeast sky heading west and descending in a diagonal trajectory.  It had a bright white light with a trailing tail and looked like a falling star, which is what I at first thought it was. It also appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object came to a stop at a position due south of our property and 45 degrees above the horizon.  The object held its position while emitting a significantly dimmer light. I originally thought that it was the spot where the falling star (meteor) had burnt out, but the light remained in the sky at the stopped position.  We continued to watch for several seconds, after which an object began to fall to the ground (perpendicular to the earth) . It seemed to emit a dim spot of light.  It traveled approximately 1/3 the distance to the ground and stopped. It then began heading east (horizontal to the earth).  At that point, the object was intensely bright and appeared to be emitting sparks very much like a fireworks display rocket.  Three additional objects did the same thing, creating a formation about 30 degrees above the horizon at a significant distance below and east of the original object.  They remained visible for several minutes, descending along looping trajectories until they disappeared below the horizon.  The attached pics and vids are of the descending formation only.

I was on the telephone and was looking for traffic behind me in the side mirror of my vehicle and noticed a red light that looked as if it could have been from a hot air balloon (which are popular around these parts) to the north.   After staring for some time I realized there wasn't a hot air balloon.  The craft appeared like a triangle with a round top and looked to have flames coming off it.  But, after watching a few moments, the craft looked to be moving upward and so were the flames.   I told the person on the phone what I was seeing in detail as I continued to look back and forth at the object as I proceeded to drive eastward down the road.   As I continued on looking back and forth at the object (unable to stop due to traffic around me), it continued upward until it looked like a small dot next to the moon.   I did not see it go through the atmosphere.  It moved at a slower pace until it got further upward.   I believe this to be a UFO because this is not my first visual encounter.",

Then as we walked further south, turning the corner going East, I kept looking for the satellite, all the sudden, halfway lower to the distance of the satellite, we both saw a light the shape of a circle that looked like a bright star, but it was moving fast and was now going Southeast.  We both were watching it talking about it because it had no lights, just a circle of light moving across the sky.  Then all the sudden, as we were watching it, the light just disappeared right before our eyes.  There were no clouds in the sky.  We both said that no way it was any type of airplane. It was very weird and strange.  I would have never thought I would ever see anything like this.   Last night I was even going to call the 911 or airport, but I decided to! wait for today to check in the Internet to see if it was mentioned by anybody else.  While I was searching, I found this website so I can report it.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness who submitted this report, and we found her to be quite eloquent in her description of the sighting, and quite sober-minded.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.  PD))",

I was facing west at a traffic light, waiting to turn south, or left, when a light caught the corner of my eye.  We have lots of air traffic so I thought at first it was just another plane.  It looked like a star or planet like Venus, but very low...just above treeline.  There was no sound.  It moved across the entire sky at a very high speed...the fastest thing I've ever seen go across the sky.  I'm an amateur astronomer and have seen satellites and meteors.  There was no tail or glow or sonic boom or explosion.  My first thought was it was a missile but again no tail.  Then I thought maybe it was a fireball but no tail and no reports anywhere.  I really can't say what it was that I saw but I've never seen anything like that in my life.  It was very very fast.

I knew these were orbs because of the way they moved.  They almost danced in the night sky, one ot two changed from white to reddish, then green, yellow or gold and back to bright white like a star, at first in unison then some faded away, the others then continued to change their position until at the end there were three left which lined up vertically one over the other at which point they merged into one.  When it appeared to be just one it changed into many colors off and on, changed shape and fizzled out and drifted away towards the east and down from our view point.  I have seen other sightings in my life but none his impressive.

They were in a half circle formation initially, but as the began to glow steady, they moved into a triangular formation.

The red light on the bottom right of the formation became brighter, then moved more to the right and began to flash and grow dim as well, until it too, vanished completely.  The red light at the top of the triangular formation- the only light left, became brighter and continued to glow red and steady as it moved higher and higher into the sky until it was gone, just like the other two red lights.",
