The group wasn't moving fast and was pretty quiet compared to all the FW's that was going off.  I looked in my truck looking for my binoculars it wasn't there and I wasn't carrying my phone.  So I moved to a darker area to focus on those aircraft, and I could make out bands on the wings, I want to say they that they had two green bands, one on each wing, but it was dark and what they were escorting was a very bright! golden/yellow craft that I could not make out completely but that it was very bright and leading the two escort jets, and they headed south.  From my perspective if you hold you two fingers in the air, arm extended, and leave a gap of about an inch, that's approx how close they were.  My only fault is I didn't record anything.",

I was sitting in the backyard of my mothers house, when I looked up, and saw, above the house behind her back fence, what appeared at first to me to be either a plastic shopping bag floating to the south.  As I watched it I began to think realize that it was unlikely something like that could be that high and still in the air.  Then I thought maybe it was a white balloon, but it was glowing white.  I followed it with my eyes as it ascended, still bearing south, up into the clouds, but it never dimmed and maintained the bright glow. Then seemed to change it's shape as it turned to go west.  It was completely silent.  Once the turn was complete, it regained it's original, round/oval shape. I ran into the house as it passed my view and told my brother to hurry and come into the front yard with me.  We both ran out into the front yard, and both witnessed it acsend higher and higher into the sky, appearing more like a bright star in midday.  As we continued to watch it, it dissapeared into the atmosphere... I had never really believed in UFO's, although open minded to it.  I have been looking at UFO videos, and many of the UFO's caught on video are exactly like the one I saw.",

      "story": "06/25/2011 A brief sighting of what appeared to be an offset horse shoe with 2 bright white lights. I was heading east on my way to work that nite.  I had been scanning the skies for the past few nites looking for sattelites.  As I approached a stop light I looked to my left, (south), when I noticed  an unusually bright light fairly low in the sky.  It really caught my attention beacuse it was so bright.   At first I thought it to be a passenger jet due to the fact that we are within miles of an intrenantional air port..  But the color of the light was quite different from other air craft that were traveling through the skies at that time...   My second thought was that it must have been a hellicopter with its search light on.   As I watched it for a few seconds, I noticed that it was moving rather quickly across the sky heading in a north eastern direction.  I began to think, \"What is that?????\"   As i continued to watch it, I noticed that there were no other blinking lights around the main light.  Not only that, the color of the light was bright soft white and the center had a bluish tint to it.  It resembled the hue of a halogen head light on a car, but much more intense. Then I noticed hat there were 2 lights on the object, one apparently in the front, and one in the back.  Both had the same type of glow, but the 1 in the back seemed less intense.   I took notice that there were still a lack of any other blinking lights to show me that it was a typical air craft.   As I watched it traveling across the sky, it appeared to be traveling closer to where I was on the road.  The 2 lights were not even in thier alighnment but they seemed to be part of the same craft, due to the flow of the flight pattern.  The rear light (the dimmer of thye 2) was a bit higher than the front (brighter) light.  Looking at the way the lights were slightly off set, I thought it to be sort of a horse shoe- offset squarish shape.  The lights being on the bottom front and rear feet. Now, the way it was fluently and very quickly cutting through the sky was what really caught my attention.  It cut across the sky traveling both easten and northern simultaneously.  It was like it didn't need to turn or change any direction in order to travel in in a direction.  It was like it was able to cut across the sky and not have to steer.  It flew faster than any other craft that I have ever seen. It was almost like it wasn't propelled by a fuel type of means.  It was too perfect and fast.  It seemed silent, almost as if it were skimming across. As it continued to cut across from the south western sky into the south east, I really took notice of the lights.  The intensity and the brightness.  I could see a very thin and vague trace of a beam that came from the rear light and pointed at an angle to the rear and slightly downward.  It quickly made its way across my view heading northerly with a hint of an easterly direction.  As if it could go both directions at once. I began to notice that it seemed to be losing altitude as it glided tword the mountains.  I quickly decided to try and track it as the light changed. I quickly decided to make a right and head north to attempt to track it.   As I approached the next signal light I could tell that it actually semmed to be descending tword the base of the mountain range.  I saw it come down to wher the mountains actually shallow out. That is when I lost sight of it.  I continued to search  it out, but by the time I got out of the buildings that covered its decent, It was gone.  I went to a gas station where I could get  good view of the exact area where I saw it descend.  But there was nothing. I figured someone else had to have seen the same thing.  There were quite a few cars out on the road for that time of nite.",

Too low to be a plane, and was two diamond shapes all black connected, it was no way it could be a helicopter.   I looked up and had to take a double look.  It was much faster.  Truly amazed.

I thought ok maybe helicopter, but it shot straight up inthe air at a rate of speed I've never seen a helicopter go.   Then all lights went out, a white light came on and it shot back down just as quickly out of my sight.   I yelled to my husband and ran further down my yard to see if I could see it again, by this point the white light is out red and blue are back on it shot down again but this time it shot diagonally.  My husband and I saw this.   After shooting diagonally, it shot straight back down at an unbelievable speed and disappeared out of sight behind houses.",

      "story": "An odd \"bubble like\" unidentified, but seen by the naked eye; appeared close to moon during Super Moon Eclipse. A friend and I were trying to get some good photos of the \"Supermoon\" Lunar Eclipse on Sept. 28th, around midnight.  We were out on the balcony of our apartment and were using both my cell phone for pics and his out dated telescope to try to possibly take some nice pics of this cool event. I downloaded 3 applications that would possibly have a telescopic or zoom affect on my phone for odvious reasons..the camera is terrible for far away pics.  During this period of pics taken I did not use my friends telescope to capture photos ..only my phone. The applications were a telescopic for telescope pics( can attach cell to telescope physically) and a so called filter or night vision app. and an app that flip flops dark and light..whatever the object being photographed the whiter or lighter colored object is reversed to black and the black object is reversed to white (easier to see in dark conditions). I started to take pics noticing an odd \"bubble like\" object that kind of bounced in front of the huge glowing moon.  It would be in front of the moon for a second..then to the right side diagonally and then in front like it was closer to me.  This lasted about 15 min.'s. In the beginning I thought maybe it was my camera reflecting the brightness of the illuminated moon. I wiped the lense over and over.  The object was still the same shape and continued to become clearer.  It appeared to look like a star when I looked by eye and when I looked through the camera on my phone, which was magnified it looked to be a clearish blue-tinted bubble and then turned a pale pink. I believe there were two objects but the other disappeared and I was only able to really capture this single object.  The photos are taken with 3 seperate apps but same cell phone. I cannot say what this was that I saw and I have no opinion to voice. My friend and I were wondering if anyone else could shed some light on this \"very cool\" occurance.  So glad I was able to share my pics. Thank you.",

      "story": "Looking west, very low in the sky (if I compare it most of the planes that go to and from the airport we have nearby),  I noticed a bright white light racing across the sky heading north.  I did not think it was a shooting start because it was closer than I had ever seen one before and it did not leave the bright trail of light  behind it ....at first.  Seeing it at first I thought it was an airplane and was concerned at tithe fact that it seemed to be traveling much faster than any plane I had seen, so my next thought was that it might be in trouble and perhaps going to crash.  After a few more seconds I observed the light produce two more smaller lights that seemed to break of or fall of the original one.  The two lights each went off in different directions then disappeared soon after.  The original larger white light began changing color from a blue green hue to almost all green and gave off a flickering or kind of flashing light display and seemed to be sl! owly of fading (or what I\u2019d picture sputtering to look like), still heading north it seemed to descend as it sputtered out and soon disappeared.  Once it had began changing color from the white to the green and gave off a lighter green aura around it   I noticed it had also started to produce a trail of light behind it, just like I\u2019ve always seen accompanying shooting stars but much more colorful, brighter, and larger than any I\u2019ve seen before.  Could very well be a shooting star or many other perfectly normal explanation for it but I thought I\u2019d post in the case that it\u2019s  not.",
