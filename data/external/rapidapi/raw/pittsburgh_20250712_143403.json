It caught my eye at first glance - that\u2019s how shiny it was.  I stared at it for five minutes and realized it could not have been a star nor a plane.  It was located way too high in the sky for it to have been a plane.  I\u2019ve seen both of those things during a sunset and neither of those were what I witnessed. I was watching the object, which looked exactly like a UFO, for 15 minutes straight.  It was a shiny silver color, and it looked horizontally elongated, like a disk.  It did not move. At about 8:50 PM, I saw the shiny object disappear into plain sight.  Again, it didn\u2019t move or anything when I saw it fade away.  It\u2019s like it camouflaged itself right into the color of the sky.  I did not see it after that.",

      "story": "As Chief Pilot for ((name of major company deleted)), I flew a group of their top scientists from Teterboro, New Jersey, to Wright Field, Ohio, on May 15, 1952.    We were in a DC-3 at 8,000' on an IFR flight plan and about a thousand feet on top of all clouds.   Around 10:15 and about 110 miles East of Pittsburgh, my copilot spotted a strange object flying with us and about 500 feet off our left wing.  It was a black, shiny cylinder round on each end and it had no wings, empennage, engines or windows.   We called Pittsburgh Radio and asked if they had any aircraft in sight near us.  They reported none.   We called our passengers up. one by one, and asked if they could see anything.  They were shocked to see the object flying beside us.   The object shot ahead of us and waited for us to catch up.  It zig-zagged across our course for half an hour.  One of the scientists calculated its speed at 1,500 mph.  It ultimately disappeared ahead of us.   We were all sworn to secrecy by the ((senior company officer)) on board, ((officer's name deleted)), because we were on our way to secure the largest research contract in ((company name deleted)) history from the Air Force and, at that time, just about anyone reporting an UFO was considered to be a wacko.   We couldn't even discuss the event with our families.   I am now ((age deleted--eighties)) and retired after 17,500 hours of flying for the Air Force and for corporations.  My copilot and passengers are all deceased.  I simply want to go on record that I and seven cool, competent observers calmly observed this object and never reported it.   Incidentally, while I was at Wright Field I asked one of their senior pilots what the fastest USAF plane could fly at. The answer was: around 500 mph. I prefer to keep this report confidential. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate, and that he will check his flight logs for the precise date.

      "story": "Saucer observed about 500 feet up moving into clear blue sky and flying square corners. After 2 morning job interviews in Pittsburgh a light rain had stopped with only clear blue sky and some low white cloud rolls were left not very high over the small hills beside the highway.  While driving south on PA Route 51 just a few miles from downtown Pittsburgh a movement toward the end of one cloud caught my eye.  When I looked up and saw it I figured it was a puff of black smoke and looked back at the road.  Then the movement which I could see out the top of the windshield on the passenger side caught my eye again and when I looked up I witnessed a round disc shaped object slip slowly from the cloud  into clear blue sky.  It was so obvious what it was I laughed and said aloud, \"Hey, you lost your cloud cover.\"  Judging by the size of a small plane's wing span of about 30 feet I'd guess that to be the same distance across this craft.  The craft was moving as if following a beam and was moving very slowly  sideways tilted away from me so I was viewing the bottom I'd think.  Shortly after losing the cloud cover and being only around 500 feet up it suddenly went to a higher altitude which would be about twice the height it was at or approximately 1,000 feet. There was no wavering or turning when it went higher, it went up at the same angel it was slanted at and moved in one motion, it did not start out slower, get faster then slow down to a stop.  The speed up to the higher level was at the same more accelerated rate, this movement took the craft away from where I was on the highway. I was now looking at it in the top middle of my windshield and where it stopped at it still had the same slow sideward movement.  It proceeded to go across the highway where I was watching it out of the top left of the windshield.  Then as suddenly as it went to a higher altitude it came back down to about the same level it was at when I first saw it but still had the same slant.  I watched out the driver's side window and observed it slide right into the end of another cloud.  This craft looked gray wi! th no li ghts or other distinguishing features and never changed its tip or slant and did not turn to go to a higher level or back down.  I think the most obvious thing about this sighting was the perfect lines or beams it was following with no wavering at all.  I received very good grades in Physics and I know even to this day that we do not have any type of propulsion system to make a craft fly like what I observed.

      "story": "Low UFO sliding out of a cloud into clear blue sky. Early morning drizzle stopped around noon, sky was clear blue with low white cloud rolls which were approximately 300 feet above the small hills of about the same height.  While driving south on PA State Route 51 a few miles south of downtown Pittsburgh just after noon a darker spot appeared in the end of one of these clouds seen at the top right of the windshield.  A quick look determined it was probably a puff of black smoke but another look was surprising to see a round saucer shapped craft slide out of the cloud into clear blue sky.  It was moving slowly from right to left bringing it closer but was tipped at about a 45 degree away.  Shortly after appearing in clear sky the craft went to a higher level about twice the height it had been at.  When it reached the higher level it still had the slow sideward motion and same degree of tip.  The motion to the higher lever was faster than the slow sideward movement but did not start out slow then get faster and slow down before stopping.  It was one smooth move and being tipped at that degree it carried the craft farther away and easily seen from the top of the windshield as it slowly crossed over the highway.  When it reached a point where it could be seen out of the driver's side window it suddenly came back down to about the same level it was when first seen.  The smooth fast motion back down was the same as when it went up and the tip never changed so it came closer.  When it stopped it still had the same slow sideward motion and it was observed sliding into the end of another cloud roll.  This craft never wavered and moved as if it was following a beam, when it went higher the craft maintained the same slant.  Assuming the visible part was the bottom of the craft no features,lights or sound was noted.  Judging by the height of the hills and clouds the size of this disc would be about the same as a small plane's wingspan.

      "story": "Transucent/transparent, crescent, uni-wing shaped object viewed through binoculars filling field of view \tI must preface this report by saying that it is a secondhand account of this event.  It was observed and reported to me by my brother and his wife. I am 57, male, my brother is 55.  I am college educated at the master\u2019s level. My brother works in technical design. \tI believe this sighting occurred on 10-28 or 10-29-2006 near 10 PM. in a suburb of Pittsburgh about ten miles from the center of town. A few weeks prior to this night my brother and wife went to a small observatory to view a comet. A couple of weeks later the comet had become bright enough to view with binoculars and on the evening  mentioned they were in their yard with binoculars, 7x35 and 10x50. The sky was dark and crystal clear without any cloud cover . \tAs they were both looking through binoculars trying to locate the comet at a position bout 45 degrees above the horizon, my brother suddenly sighted something for which he has no explanation. He told me that he immediately realized that he would probably only have a brief  time to view what he was seeing and became intense in an effort to observe and remember details. This is where his report gets kind of weird. \tThe main characteristic of  the object was, well, he said the best way he could describe it was,\"\u201cIt looked like the Romulan vessel (from the TV series Star Trek) when it would become cloaked (turning invisible).\"  He observed it for about seven to ten seconds.  During that time it was moving and changed direction twice.  The motion did not appear to be fast (unless this was much farther away than he realizes in which case the object would also be extremely large).  The first change in direction was about ninety degrees to the original motion and then ninety degrees back to the original path and then he lost sight of it. During this movement it moved toward him and overhead. \tWhen I asked him about it\u2019s altitude, he was uncertain since there were no clouds,only stars, but said if he had to guess it was probably cloud level or lower. Later he calculated size and distance by measuring the field of  view in his binoculars at a known distance on land. The image he saw that night filled the entire view of his binoculars. He concluded if it was 200 - 300 feet it must have been about two to three thousand feet high or about one half mile. Closer and it would have been smaller. He heard no noise. Fartheraway and it would have to be larger. \tAt this point, he asked his wife if she had just seen anything. Her response after a moment of hesitation was, \"Well, it was kind of invisible.\"  He told her not to say another word, not wanting to bias his memory of the observation.  He asked her to come into  the house.  He got two pieces of paper and they went into separate rooms to draw what they saw. \tHe showed me the drawings.  They were simple outlines.  Remember that it was invisible. Also remember that they were both looking through binoculars and the object filled the entire field of view in his 10x50.  One thing that I noticed between their drawings was that the overall proportion of width to length were quite the same.  The overall shape and proportion resembled a crescent moon but not as curved, more elongated.  And rounded, not pointed at the tips.  The leading edge was curved and smooth, however, the back edge was less curved and both curves bowed forward in the direction of motion. \tAdditional detail noticed by my brother (looking through more powerful binoculars) but not his wife is as follows:  The back edge was serrated like a steak knife with seven points.  Along the entire front edge were what appeared to him as markings.  Each was a mirror image of the next and he described them as ornate curls as on a wrought iron railing or perhaps a curled animal\u2019s horn.  This whole image appeared as translucent or transparent except for the details mentioned. \tMy brother could not come up with any possible explanation for what they saw. He definitely ruled out clouds, vapor trails, etc.  It was moving, changed direction and maintained the definite shape as described.  He was glad his wife was with him in that their mutual observation verified the reality of the sighting.  Otherwise, he feels that he would question and have a hard time believing that he really saw this (?). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

My friend and I were walking through a local park in the city of Pittsburgh close to midnight on Sunday night.  We were heading west towards the park entrance, my friend was ahead of me.  We were going back to where he thought he dropped his cell phone earlier. As I was walking, I was looking up at the sky noticing how nice the stars looked, trying to pick out constellations.  After about a minute of star gazing I observed to what at first to be a bright, yellow in color, meteor streaming across the sky.  But while looking at the object I noticed there was no trail behind, I also saw that within the yellow glow that there was a very distinct disk shaped craft with a darker center (very solid looking).  I only observed it for about one to one and a half seconds max. The object appeared to stop, or rapidly slow down, at one point in midflight, (for a mille second) and continue its flight at the same rate of speed, maybe around 100,000mph.  I observed it flying at an altitude of 400-500 ft., moving silently, no noise at all , traveling in a straight path from the SSE towards the NNW.  I estimated its size to be about 250ft across. In the time I saw the object it appeared to clear about 30-50 miles (within 1-1.5 sec.). Unfortunately neither my friend, who was searching for his phone, nor the bum in the park could confirm my sighting, to my knowledge I am the only person who had seen the object. I am a custodian with the Pittsburgh Public Schools, a very \"normal\" person.  What I saw that night left me frozen in shock, I couldn\u2019t move or speak, I even cried a bit (could have been due to my eyes being wide open from the experience).

I couldn't tell if there was a light on all three of them, but I only saw one light appear at a time.  The light may have been blinking, or I may have only seen it every so often because the object was rotating.  It was hard to tell what exactly happened although these objects were very close to me.  They changed directions like this while all three of them remained in a very tight formation all moving the exactly the same speed.  They did not slow down to move around one another or anything.  What really seemed out of the ordinary was that the objects were extremely close to one another.  At times it was hard to tell if there was more than one of them; not saying that they became one at any point, but that is how close they were.  The rotated around one another, perhaps in a circle each one taking turns being the lead craft.  They left my sight however as my view became obstructed by the edge of the building.  I then moved to another window to see them, but I did not see them again.  Also peculiar was that there seemed to be more jets than usual after I saw the objects.  Now I have just moved to the city about six months ago, but I know where the airport is and what it looks like when jets and planes leave for takeoff or come in to land.  I saw three different jets, too far away to tell if they were commercial airliners or fighter jets, but it was very unusual.  Usually when looking into the sky there may be one plane every ten minutes that one could see in the sky from where I was, for there to be three at once was very unusual.  They were flying at seemingly random areas of the sky, not anywhere near where they would be if they were coming in to land or were just leaving the airport.  The jets also seemed to be climbing in altitude at an unusually high pace, for whatever reason, but I do not think that commercial airliners would climb at this high of a rate.  Whether this had anything to do with the objects I saw, I do not know, but I do know that this alone was very unusual.  After I saw this occur, I went out again to see if anything else was out there, but there was no sign of any strange objects.  I then went inside while the jets were still flying above me.  I could not unfortunately get a picture of the objects as the camera I have on my phone is could not take a clear picture of the bright sky.",

The bright light started to twinkle, as most stars seemed to do, but then it started to become larger and brighter, approx 3-4 times larger and much brighter, still NOT moving.  At this time, the object immediately condensed back into its original size and brightness and then shot horizontally at a massive speed to where it appeared to be over the south Hills.   It then halted for a micro second, and shot up vertically at a complete right angle into the clouds as fast as it went horizontally.

      "story": "Bright orange ball of fire hovers then snapped back up into the atmosphere at a high rate of speed On Tuesday November 18, 2008 I decided to go back to my mothers\u2019 home, the home I grew up in, after I left work at 8:00pm. She resides in Upper St. Clair, PA, a quiet suburb south of Pittsburgh.  I arrived at her home about twenty after eight in the evening. There was a very light snow on the ground. I went to the house, let myself in and found her in the kitchen. After making some coffee and sitting in the kitchen talking for about a half an hour, she went upstairs to change from her work clothes into her pajamas. I went to use the upstairs bathroom. The bathroom faces the front of the house and the road. She lives on a very quiet road with very little traffic, but numerous homes. Behind the house is a very dense wooded area that prohibits any light from coming up the hill from the road below. The road behind the house is about a \u00bc mile from our home. I was using the bathroom sitting on the toilet when I heard her go down the stairs. As I was finishing up, I glanced through the venetian blinds as I have a millions times in the past when I was younger. What I saw has occupied all of my time awake and while asleep for the last 24 hours. The shadow of her home was cast on the snow, a perfect silhouette. No car lights would have been able to accomplish this because of how steep the hill and how dense the woods are behind the house, even with sparse leaves on the branches. I yanked up my pants up, zipper down and shirt untucked and bolted down the stairs. My mother was frozen like a statue staring out the back window. What we saw at that point we will remember for the rest of our lives. In the sky only about 10 yards above the tree line, there hovered a perfectly quiet but blazing ball of orange light. I would estimate it to be about 15-20 yards in width. Not oval or cylindrical, but perfectly round. It was very strong and not pulsating or shifting. It was not blinding us at all.  I looked back at the front window, this time from the family room and still saw the house silhouetted on the snow. I continued to stare out the back door that leads that leads to the raised porch as I opened the door. No sound, no heat, no vibration just this spectacular ball of light as I stood on the porch. I ran back in to get a camera down in the game room on the basement level. As I ran to the back door under the porch, the ball became smaller and smaller as it seemed to be yanked back into the sky at an extremely rapid pace. I never got a shot off. I didn\u2019t have time to turn the camera on unfortunately. Today, she asked the next door neighbors, who are an older couple, they saw nothing. Nor did a woman she knows through church who lives on the hillside about 1 mile away from our home, directly behind the house. I believe what we witnessed was not of this world. This was certainly not a noisy helicopter or some child playing a prank. This was a real, tangible, perfectly silent ball of orange fire well above the tree line. If anyone in this area had a similar encounter from the evening of 11/18/08 I would be highly interested in hearing your account of that evening. Can anyone help us understand this?",

Myself and 4 witnesses were outside viewing an unknown aircraft that had no noise and only a visible red fire ball type effect. 14 consecutive air crafts would fly solo in about 5 minute increments and head to the same direction and vanish. They could not have been airplanes, helicopters, or even stealth jets. They were more discreet and two of them came very close to each other in a controlled and slowed motion, then parted ways because the other 12 begin to come into the picture. I am not a huge believer in ufo's etc, but this one was my first and am curious to know what it was or if there was any planned Auto Drone experiment going on or what not. Hope this helps!",

I couldn't see any body of the helicopter.  At one point, all of the lights turned off but one.  It looked much like a star in the sky.  Then all of a sudden, it turned into a VERY bright light that was painful to stare at.  It then proceeded to turn back on it's directional lights and strobe light. Just a few short miles up river on the Allegheny, I saw a similar craft.  It could have been the same, but would have had to move at a lightning speed.  It did the exact same thing with the lights as the first craft. I live fairly close to an airport.  I have seen planes and helicopters at night before.  I have seen them from all different angles and making many turns.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen before.  And again I stress, all I saw was the lights.

On September 19, 2012, while talking on the phone in my sunroom, at around 10:00 p.m., I saw two, round, orange lights in the sky coming from the south east.  It looked so unusual because they were traveling so close to one another.  At first I thought it was a double reflection in the glass of my glass door.  This door is on the right side of my sunroom.  One light was following the other, moving at a slow steady pace.  The best I could describe them is two full moons, the size of which is when the moon is higher in the sky and not at the horizon.  These lights however were about as high as a low flying airplane going overhead. At first I thought maybe they were two airplanes heading towards the airport since they were in the part of the sky of the air traffic pattern I see so often.   However, the two lights were moving towards the north, which would be the direction of downtown Pittsburgh and not the airport.  I opened the glass sliding door to possibly hear a jet engine, but there was no sound at all.  It was a very clear night and you could see a lot of stars. I quickly hung up the phone and grabbed my camera which was close by.  I then went to another sliding door which faces the backyard to take pictures.  By this time it was directly over my backyard at about a 65 degree angle.  I didn\u2019t have any lights on in the room I was in, so I frantically thought I was snapping pictures when I realized I was in video mode and was turning my camera off and on.  I then turned on the outside light to see my camera settings and then started taking a video clip.  The two lights were starting to fade in the distance and they were now looking white and not orange with my naked eye. I then went to my computer and started to search for any information I could find to see if anyone else saw this.  It was not reported in the news. Today I called KDKA, one of the local TV stations to see if anyone else reported seeing the two orange lights in the sky and they said no, I was the only one.  They would not be able to take me seriously unless they had more than one call. I checked a compass to see what the approximate directions the two lights traveling. To my best ability the lights I saw came from the southeast sky on the compass reading 27/150 traveling northwest on the compass reading 60/340. I would like to know what exactly I saw that night.  It was really strange.",

      "story": "Enormous black triangle, southeast of Pittsburgh, 1987/88. Hello.  I have shared this story with a very few individuals, close friends who can be trusted.  I have also, more recently, shared it online, in emails to a few individuals, in hopes of getting some kind of (hopefully positive) feedback, possibly opening a dialogue with someone who has had a similar experience, but as yet to date, feedback has been minimal, and no dialogue.  I am certain there are others who have had similar experiences, but don\u2019t know how to go about finding them.  At any rate, here goes:   Back in about 1987 or 1988, I was staying at a friend\u2019s house.  I was doing some work on their farm, southeast of Pittsburgh, PA.  I was sleeping on the couch, when I had a \"dream\" that was not a dream.  Let me elaborate:  I was startled awake somehow, and had the instantaneous impulse to get up and run outside, onto the porch.  When I did, I saw an enormous black triangle hovering above, and slightly to the right (South) of the house.  There were no discernible lights, as I recall, but there seemed to be dome-like shapes along the bottom of the thing.  (craft? Ship?)  I don\u2019t know how long I stared at it, but I became aware that it appeared to be sucking up trees from the ground and levitating them up into it somehow.  I started crying. Suddenly there was a blonde female there with me, about 5\u2019 4\" tall, straight blonde hair, like in the \"Swedish Bikini Team\" commercials, dressed in either black or dark blue close fitting flight suit type uniform.  I don\u2019t recall any kind of emblems or markings on the uniform.  { I will note here that at that time I had not heard of the Billy Meier case.  I have only learned of it recently.}  I did not, far as I remember, actually see her descend from the vehicle, she was just kind of suddenly there on the porch with me.  I immediately felt reassurance, and an overwhelming sense of peace and calm.  She told me that everything would be alright, that they were going to put the trees back when they were done, that everything would be as it had been before, and that there would be no sign that anything had happened.  I looked into her eyes, (deep blue or maybe green, like a lake) and I instantly felt as though we had known each other for a very long time, maybe forever.  I knew her name then, though I don\u2019t know it now.  She put her hand on my shoulder, and, \"Bam.\"  I was waking up on the couch again, startled.   I got up and ran outside, fully expecting to see a black triangle, but there was nothing in the sky except stars.  I stood there dumbfounded, thinking it must\u2019ve been a dream, but it was no dream.  I know it wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if she wiped my memory, and maybe it didn\u2019t fully erase, (?) or if maybe I was allowed to remember only certain parts of the experience, or if I was supposed to believe that it was \u201cjust a dream.\"  I really wish that she would return again, the connection I felt was so profoundly deep. I will add that the area where the farm was is not far from a high-security government installation, the US Bureau Of Mines, which I don\u2019t believe for a minute is actually a coal mine.  They have 12\u2019, double-row, barbed wire fences surrounding the place, which were in place as long ago as the early 1980s, long before the heightened state of security in the post 9/11 era.  I had a friend who used to work there as a janitor.  A few of us decided to go and see him one day, there was a sliding gate which was open, and on a whim we just decided to drive in and see if we could find him.  Within about a minute, we were being closely followed by a dark blue Chevy Caprice Classic.  We kept on driving.  Then a white Chevy Caprice Classic pulled out in front of us, cutting us off.  Three men wearing black suits, black ties, and black sunglasses approached the car, and demanded identification.  One of them said, \u201cState your business here.\u201d  We told them we were looking for our friend.! He said, \u201cThis is a restricted area.  You have no business here.  Turn your vehicle around and leave immediately.\u201d  Needless to say, we were scared shitless.  We were teenagers out for a ride on an otherwise uneventful day.  We turned around, with the blue car now in front of us, and the white car following us closely.  They followed us like that after we got back on the main road, for about a mile or so.  It was very weird.  Were they the infamous \u201cmen in black?\u201d And, if so, why were they there?  Why would they need such a high level of security at a \u201ccoal mine\u201d anyway?  I knew from then on that there was something not right about that place, it gave me the creeps, and I always tried to avoid it if possible. This incident took place earlier than the other one, approximately 1985 or so.  There have been other strange occurrences throughout my life, but these two stand out in my memory. My ex wife, some friends, and I were laying on a trampoline in a yard, stargazing.  We all remarked about this bright red dot, wondering if it was Mars, or what, when all of a sudden, it just shot off to the north northeast, zip!  We all said \u201cWhoa, what the hell was that?!\u201d  This was just after the time of the Hale-Bopp Comet. I have more, but I will wait for a reply on this first.  Namaste. My ethnicity is Native American/Celtic/Anglo-Saxon. My religion is Pagan, though I was raised Methodist. I am currently in my mid forties, at the time of the first incident listed, I was in my twenties, at the time of the second incident I was a teenager, at the time of the third incident I was around thirty. The memory of the first incident, though incomplete, is extremely vivid. I have strange, \"Post Apocalyptic\" dreams sometimes.

      "story": "bright light on small disc craft January & October 1992 Bates & McKee Pittsburgh, PA This event occurred in south Oakland, near Bates & McKee Place, in Pittsburgh, PA. At about 11pm, on October 16, 1992, just after I reached up to turn off the lamp above my bed, my room was filled with dazzling yellow light, as bright as daylight.  Thinking a transformer had blown on the power lines on the next street, I got up to look out the window.  The light coming in between the curtains was warm to my skin, like sunlight.  The source of the light seemed to be very close to the window.  I, then, wondered if someone were on the roof of the neighboring warehouse, shining some sort of light around the roof.  Earlier in the day, I the dirigible had made a chugging sound, and this light source made no sound. When I opened my curtains, I saw a small, round, Oreo cookie-shaped vehicle, with a domed top and bottom.  In the center layer were small round lights on the outer ring of the craft.  The lights were amber in color.  From the bottom, emitted the singular, enormous light beam I had seen coming through my window.  The craft was about twelve to fifteen feet above my window and seemed to be about three and a half feet in diameter.  It was slowly ascending from the roof of the adjacent warehouse. By now, the light beam was no longer pointed towards my window, but had swung away from it, shining along the wall to the back garden and the adjacent warehouse that made an L-shaped wall around the garden.  It shone on the garden for a brief moment, then, swung back so that it was perpendicular to the craft.  Then, it retracted into the craft and the entire vehicle disappeared.  It had not made a sound. I woke my next door neighbor who reported seeing two beams of light coming through his window earlier, maybe 30 minutes before my experience.  He said that one beam had been blue and the other had been amber.  His windows faced the warehouse wall below where I saw the craft. He had been too tired to get out of bed to investigate. At this point, it was midnight and I could not account for an entire hour of my time. We went outside to see if we could see the lights or anything unusual, but we saw nothing.  No one on the street seemed to be looking surprized or paying any attention to the building where we had seen the light.  My neighbor climbed on the roof of the warehouse to see if there was evidence of something having been there, but he found nothing. The next day, the elderly woman who lived in the apartment directly above mine reported being frightened by the bright light shining in her window the night before.  She did not open the curtains to directly observe the light.  She had lived in the building for 40+ years and was terrified of this light that night, deciding, \"It was a sign from God!\"   Also, prior to seeing the light, my apartment had smelled strange, as if something hot and metallic were burning a bit.  I even checked my oven to see if the smell emitted from there, but it did not.  The other peculiar thing is that an electric alarm clock kept buzzing--not with the alarm sound, but with an electrical hum--in the hours directly preceding my sighting of this craft.  This clock was on a bureau beside the window from which I had seen the craft. Ten months prior to this experience, in mid-January 1992, a bright light had awoken me around 2am. (My room was normally very dark, sheltered from outside street lights.)   My boyfriend was staring at the light, but did not respond when I asked him what it was.  In this instance, I did not get up and investigate.  I was too frightened to get out of bed.  The light lasted a moment or two and went out. The next morning, my boyfriend did not recall seeing any light in the middle of the night. I think that this was the same craft perhaps visiting on two separate occasions.  The warehouse on which it was located stores food for a large local restaurant, but particularly houses many whole potatoes that are cut up to make a popular item at the restaurant.  My building and the warehouse were owned by the same person.  I did verify with the building maintenance personnel that no one had been on the warehouse roof with a light.  They all said that they had not been up there and that no light of that candle power was on the property, nor any other thing that could have looked like what was seen.",

We have never seen anything like this at first I thought maybe it was a plane on fire until we got a good view as we passed under the object then we thought maybe it was a meteoroid but it had no trail and it clearly looked like some type of bronze craft and had a fireball and it was actually flying like an aircraft being controlled it didn't look like anything we have ever seen before what ever this was it was on fire and it moved in a straight direct path.  It was not a Chinese lantern.  I'm hoping others who possibly noticed this in this area as well reports this and has a photo to share of it.

((NUFORC Note:  We do not know who the source of the report, and I strongly doubt that I suggested that the individual's report was \"false.\"  We rarely have any idea which reports are sincere and accurate, and which are bogus.  PD))  This recent incidence happened while I was traveling to play golf, on 79 north going over the Glenfied Bridge.  Already filed a report.  On my way to meet a buddy at Olde Stonewall.  That's near Zelionople.  I leave from near Pitt International. I know my aircraft.  Former Navy Analyst.  Was one of two suits in a sea of white and gold bars in the Pentagon. Was a constant at Wings Over Pittsburgh.  Pilots of 16s and 18s couldn't believe what I knew. I know my stuff. I can differentiate just the sound of mil power vs commercial or private. Just find someone to confirm what I saw.  It was at 12:30 as I traveled north on 79 to Zeli.  It was less than a minute.  I was going 75mph over a mile long bridge.  I saw this thing going straight over Pittsburgh.  Seven miles by air away. Please find a confirm  Or then  tell me I'm right or don't contact. Also something in Amsterdam, NY.  Me and a friend were outside late at night.  He was smoking and I was having a chew. This craft, very high altitude, came over.  But every time it \"glowed\" it accelerated like crazy.  Much faster than regular commercial craft. We both just looked at each other, and said to each other we'd never seen such a thing.  There is an old AF base near there.  So don't rule that out.  In fact the A12/SR71 used to to have service there after twelve hour trips. This wasn't that.  No 16.  No 15.  No 22.  And no Hornet, whatever it was defied explanation. No noise. No goofiness.  Just a couple guys watching the sky.  Actually we were using his iPhone app to identify constellations and stars. So after you telling me I filed a false report, find some submission somewhere to verify my report of the abnormal object I saw over Pittsburgh. If anything you can find is false, then go back to your bunker.  You pissed me off.",

      "story": "Flat black color, 6-legged, toy jack shaped, basketball-sized object on the ground melting snow in a squall This report is about a snowy winter night in 1968, 1969 or 1970.  That is the best I can pinpoint the \u2018ancient history\u2019 from my past. The unidentified object was shaped very similarly to a jack in the child\u2019s game of \u2018ball & jacks\u2019. It was on the ground, tilted so its low side faced the city.  It was flat-black color. Its circumference was slightly larger than a basketball. Toy jacks that I recall had 4 legs radiating outward from a center axis.  This object had 6 legs.  Two front legs were feet-on-the-ground, facing the city.  Two legs were a bit off the ground and to the left and right sides of the \u2018face\u2019.  Two \u2018rear legs\u2019 in the back of the \u2018jack\u2019 were off the ground facing uphill. It was an odd configuration because whoever saw it asked, at least instinctively, \u201cHow could 4 legs off of the ground be outweighed by the 2 front legs that were on the ground and tilted to face the city?\u201d  This basketball-sized jack with the flat-black finish was sitting halfway up a hill in Grandview City Park in the Pittsburgh, PA. A neighborhood named \u201cMount Washington\u201d overlooks Pittsburgh. Mt. Washington has two well known vantage points that gaze across the river at the downtown skyscrapers.  These vantages are Grandview Avenue and Grandview Park.  They are on opposite ends of the neighborhood. Grandview Avenue got lots of pedestrian and vehicle traffic.  Grandview Park got much less, especially during winter. The park has an observation deck near the main entrance.  Uphill from the deck, the park is \u2018terraced\u2019 by 3 service roads. Atop the hill are 2 huge water tanks.  The park\u2019s lowest road is its main service road (no public access for vehicles].  It\u2019s between the hill and the observation deck.  This road is 2 vehicles wide. There are 2 more single-lane service roads.  They are further up the hillside. The position of these roads gives a framework for the remainder of this report. The highest service road goes to the water tanks.  At its apex it was about 60 yards (175\u2019) higher than the main service road.  The middle service road was about 40 yards (125\u2019) above the main service road. I know these distances because on snowy nights I practiced playing football.  Specifically, while walking our family\u2019s fearless German Shepherd, I played quarterback.  I threw snowballs at trees. They were adjacent to the service roads and spaced apart at intervals of 10 to 50 yards.  I knew the distances with respect to the same distances on a football field. Facing the water tanks and, thus, facing away from the city, the large hill is gumdrop-shaped.  At its base is the main service road.  The highest and midway, single-lane service roads curve across the face of the hill.  They intersect at the main road. This particular night I walked Duke (the dog) up to the top of the hill.  It was snowing medium hard.  We could see only the brightest lights of the nearest downtown buildings.  And those lights were fuzzy & foggy.  The same was true for visibility of the park\u2019s service road street lights at the opposite end of the park\u2019s main entrance.  Only the 2 of us were walking through the park. The snow was ankle deep to mid-calf, depending on drifts formed by the wind.  The snow was deep enough that the wind that whistled through the park during winter had not yet blown any spots bald to render them devoid of snow. We walked along the highest service road over the crown of the hill facing the city, walked down the hill to the midway service road, to double back to where we entered.  Duke was usually rambunctious and very curious.  He knew my game of snowball football. Sometimes, he liked to race me to where my snowball hit a tree.  That night we\u2019d done some casual racing in the snow to about 10 trees. We got to one of his favorite places to race & run.  The next tree was about 40 yards away. He liked hearing \u201cpop\u201d when my snowball hit that tree.  He liked to take-off as he watched its flight.  But he didn\u2019t on that night.  He shied away from hurrying toward that tree. He avoided the upside of the service road and stayed his leash\u2019s length away on the downhill side toward the city. He usually preferred the uphill side because other dogs marked their spots on the uphill side. As we made our way toward the tree I\u2019d just hit with a snowball, I noticed a depression in the snow on that service road.  I couldn\u2019t yet see it clearly because the city lights and park street lights were dimmed by medium-heavy snowfall, but there was definitely something dimensionally odd about a point in the snow near tree I\u2019d just hit. The nearer we got to my new \u2018line-of-scrimmage\u2019 (the tree), the more Duke was reluctant to continue. He always led the charge toward any new curiosity.  But he didn\u2019t this time.  As I got nearer, I saw a circular black spot with almost no snow on the asphalt service road. Then I started seeing the jack-shaped, object dormantly sitting there. I got about 2-3 yards away from it.  Duke stayed with me although he had enough leash to go sniff it -- which he\u2019d done with everything before and after our encounter with that object; put his nose right on or in it. I did not feel heat radiating from the jack, but heat had to explain why there was no snow in the radius around it.  I ventured to a bit more than an arm\u2019s length away.  I picked up a pinch of the fluffy snow and sprinkled it toward the jack.  A bit of my sprinkling landed on it and was gone in less than 2 minutes.  It took only slightly longer to vanish than the regular snow falling on and around it. Meanwhile, I studied it as closely as I dared.  I saw no seams, nothing that resembled a hatch or window.  Yet I had the distinct sense that it was specifically facing the city lights; almost like admiring the view through the snow while enjoying the calm & silence of such a snowfall.  At the same time I had a definite sense of \u201cHands OFF!  Don\u2019t touch!\u201d   The center of the jack had the biggest pod/cylinder; both in diameter and height.  At the end of each leg were smaller-scale versions of the same pod.  The pods were approximately the same diameter as the legs that connected them to the center core.  If they were different diameters, then it was by a mere millimeter or less; measurable only with calipers.  Small as it was it didn\u2019t seem spindly.  It seemed sturdy.  It didn\u2019t seem hostile, but it wasn\u2019t inviting or overtly friendly.  It emitted a sense (or invisible aura) of power . . . not energy, but of power. Duke inched nearer to it only as I did. I was his shield and security.  This was totally out of character for our fierce, fearless dog.  I\u2019d always needed to restrain him. He was a trained attack dog that K-9 police gave us because he was too aggressive ~ until he encountered this jack. This whole encounter was 3-5 minutes. I stepped past the jack, threw a few more snowballs at my next possible (football receiver) trees, drifted back to the jack for one last look, and saw no changes.  Then we returned home.  My snowballs were unusually accurate that night; missing 1 or 2 of 75-80 throws.  The next day my brother took Duke for his morning walk.  I told him about the black jack.  He looked for it.  It was gone. But where I\u2019d seen it there was a divot in the snow shaped like the bottom of a basketball. Thinking about it you\u2019ve got to ask: \u201cWhy was all of the ground below it devoid of snow?  Why not only where just the front feet touched the ground?  How did the black jack get there?  Obviously, it didn\u2019t walk or tumble there. Why were there no tracks or footprints in the virgin snow?\u201d  That made no sense. It had been snowing for 2-3 hours.  Anyone/thing moving afoot through the park would have left telltale tracks. And, Duke very cautiously and tentatively stuck his nose only so close as if a spherical energy field was radiating outward from the jack, just 1-2 inches beyond the full length of the jack\u2019s legs.  My observation was that Duke knew or sensed something to the effect, \u201cThat\u2019s as near as you get!\u201d  But maybe it was selective/smart shielding because snow was OK for touching the jack. These are my thoughts articulated today (November 2013) but at least subconsciously in my 15-17 year-old awareness during the encounter.  It was weird, semi-spooky, and it simply \u201cdidn\u2019t add up\u201d.  While looking at it I pondered picking it up and taking it home to show Dad (a master engineer of power plants, steel mills and water processing facilities).  But Duke avoided the jack as though it was the Plague -- a sign to duly consider.  And I had no idea of where to put it, what to do with it, and it \u2018felt\u2019 too strange. The jack looked different than all other UFO configurations/shapes that I\u2019d seen before and that I\u2019ve seen since.  I kind of have regrets about this probably dubious \u2018opportunity\u2019.  But I played it safe and I\u2019m still alive to tell you about it. ----------- Completing the end of this report form . . .  Contact me if you want.  I can not accept (pay for) a collect call.

      "story": "Saucer shaped object with orange lights. I can remember my UFO sighting as if it happened yesterday.  It was September 7, 1970. 11:10 p.m. I was about to start my senior year in high school.  We lived on a main highway just up from a very bad intersection where there were always accidents.  (Seven miles south of Pittsburgh, PA.)    At 11:10 p.m. that night I was leaving one upstairs room to go into the bathroom when I noticed a light somewhat flickering on the sheer draperies.  I assumed it was another accident and the lights of a tow truck.  I walked to the window to look down at the intersection and saw nothing.  I realized the light was coming from above.  I saw a huge circular metal craft with lights on the bottom.  It silently was hovering over my side yard at a slight angle so that I could only see the bottom of it.  It was just above the poplar tree tops along the border of our property.  I got a very close up look at it.  The bottom was slightly convex and a matte colored dark metal.   There were what looked like semi opaque tempered glass panels on the bottom.  Similar to a bathroom window.  You can see light but glass is not transparent.  Those panels are where the amber lights emanated.  They were on constantly but yet had a slight pulsating flicker to them.  For some reason, although I don't know why, I thought it was due to the power source of the craft.   I saw it for approximately 15 seconds as it hovered silently.  Then, faster than I could blink my eyes, it took off at a 45 degree angle to the west.  I was so terrified and will never forget what I saw.   I am sending a drawing explaining what it looked like to the email listed on your website.   If you call me I can give you exact locations and any other info you might want.

      "story": "Saw &quot;Fireballs&quot; in the sky last night.  Same as many other UFO video and sightings. Have pictures. At approx. 9:15 P.M., I was on the phone with my mother and from behind the tall oak trees, I saw 3 very large fire ball looking objects in the sky.  They were flying relatively low, juxtaposed to the typical air traffic I see here. The balls were in a V formation, but were floating and flying at the same time... kind of swerving back and forth, but staying in somewhat of a V formation.  I could barely tell my mother I'd call her back.  Tried to hang up and get my phone camera set up. By the time I focused and clicked, all but one was gone.  Unfortunately, my camera picked up a dot.  They just \"went out.\"  They didn't fly away.  The sky was very clear and they definitely did not fly away.  They just disappeared. Called mom back in a freaked out state and was on the phone with her...  Maybe 3-5 minutes and saw another one coming from the same direction.  This time I didn't take time to say goodbye.  Got the phone working and when I aimed to take the picture, there were 4 lights on my screen and only 1 in the sky.  I kept snapping pictures, despite my disbelief. There were 4 on the screen and 1 in the sky. It too, just disappeared. All of them would sort of \"blink out.\"  Again, unfortunately my phone camera stinks, but I did get the fireball and when I expand the photos, the lights look round but the more they expand, they look almost like crescent moons, a fuzzy backwards \"C.\"   Upon further inspection, I realized that the 2 lights on the bottom of the screen, were house lights.  You can distinguish the other two, as they are much higher in the sky and have the exact same crescent shape upon expanding the photo.  I do not know if the second one appeared whilst I was focused on the other one. I searched and found a video of another sighting here in Pittsburgh from this past Aug. 2013. found on YouTube.  It's exactly what I saw.  Also found many videos from around the globe, with the exact thing I saw. I did not report it for fear of looking nuts and no one else (apparently) saw them or reported seeing anything.  I am a stay at home mother of 5 children and am the fourth generation on my mother's side, to live in our old farm house located on the outskirts of the City of Pittsburgh.  We have lots of land here, despite still being in the city. I know that what I saw was not normal.  We have regular air traffic flying overhead, as the airport is relatively close by.  I saw airplanes, shortly after these sightings.  These were not airplanes.  When I saw the exact same things, littered all over UFO sighting websites and YouTube, my heart sank further.  This scared me enough to be up all night researching and to now be reporting this. For some reason, I can't check the information below.  I would definitely like to be contacted.  I also have a story about my sister and I when we were kids.  Hesitant to share it online.",

There was a low flying object.  Rectangle shaped maybe tradition UFO disc with 4 huge lights not consistent with a aircraft I see planes all the time.  This object was not over head but visible thru the windshield moved from r to l across the windshield in view maybe half way cutting aross the window.   I looked at him and said you see that??  He said ya I seen it.  I said was it a plane?  He said idk what it was.  And won't answer to this day what it was.  There was from left to right square white light rectangle red light small space red rectangle white square.  This was NO blinking light that all air planes have.   We live between 2 airports but this thing was silent and zoomed across too fast.  And was gone!!!!  By the time I hit the corner. I obviously don't belive in \"god\" literally but I assure you this is 100% true story.

I live about 5 miles north of downtown Pittsburgh, PA.  I just happened to look up at the sky (there were no stars this night) and saw two orange-red lights slowly moving through the sky side by side.  I thought it was a plane at first.  The two lights then separated from each other and slowly moved apart and then stopped completely and just hovered in the air.  Then, two more orange-red lights appeared right in the area of the original two.  There were now four orange-red lights hovering in the air, not moving at all and all were approximately the same size but, one of the original two lights was the biggest of all four.  Three of the four lights began disappearing and reappearing in roughly the same spot over the next 5 to 10 minutes.  During this time I used my compass on my IPhone and found that the objects were in the southeast sky (I also got some of the lights on video b! ut, it is a bit grainy).  The entire time these objects were disappearing and reappearing, one of the lights, the biggest one of the four, remained illuminated and appeared to slowly grow in size.  Then the large steady orange-red light began dropping smaller orangish balls of light from it.  It dropped about three smaller orange colored lights, which would travel straight down and then disappear after 2 or 3 seconds.  After this occurred, all four of the lights illuminated and moved slowly north, with three of them disappearing again.  The large steady orange-red light traveled out of direction with the other three and headed almost exactly in the direction I was standing at in front of my house.  When it began getting close enough where I could see the object really growing in size and see that there was more to the object than just the orange light, it disappeared.  This same light then reappeared about 30 seconds later, dropped one more orange colored light from it and ! completely disappeared. I watched this area of the sky for the next 20 minutes and may have briefly seen an orange light but, nothing like what I first witnessed.  I did see several helicopters in this area in the next 20 minutes but, I am not sure if the two are related.",

I had a restless night and had trouble falling asleep the entire night.  I was laying on my right side and my bedroom window was behind me.  My dog was lying next to my back.  She got up and I turned to look at her and I seen that her tail was between her legs.  Something had spooked her and she does have a lot of sound phobias but I did not hear anything.  I am pretty well versed in canine behavior and body language and have been studying this subject for a while now as I am working towards a career in this field.  She jumped off the end of the bed and went to her \u201csafe spot\u201d underneath the bed. As she jumped, I noticed a bright light in my peripheral vision outside my window.  I turned my head and looked and saw a line of 5 or 6 lights in a straight line moving at a moderate rate of speed.  Maybe like 150-200 mph as a rough estimate.  It seemed like it appeared out of nowhere.   As I focused my eyes on it I noticed the lights were alternating colors of blue and white.  They were all fluctuating in intensity and were going from bight to very bright.  Suddenly, the craft just disappeared.  I didn\u2019t see it take off, it just vanished.  I estimated it to be at an elevation of about 5-7 thousand feet.  I continued to look for the next 25 minutes or so but saw nothing.  The entire event lasted all but 2 seconds. This took place in the SSE direction and I live about 5-7 miles directly south of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.   I turned on my smartphone 20 minutes or so after the sighting to see what the weather condition were.  It was cloudy with the cloud cover at 95% and the cloud ceiling was at 12,700 feet.

      "story": "String of Red Lights at Elevation, Spanning 40 Degrees, in the vicinity of the Allegheny County Airport. We live in Pittsburgh west of the Allegheny County Airport (located in West Mifflin). My wife, walking the dog in our yard, noticed a string of uniformly spaced red lights at altitude (as one would expect a Life Flight helicopter to be) spanning at least 40 angular degrees. She called me to the yard, and I also observed them. I observed (at times using binoculars) that they appeared to be rising, in a spaced fashion, one after another, from a single point in the southeast and heading to the southwest. We estimated they were rising in the vicinity of the airport. One plane observed was perceived by us to be lingering in the area, but the plane, a commercial airliner or cargo plane, subsequently flew over our house, so the perception of lingering must have been due to a great initial distance and we observed it flying into the area. Towards the end of the event, we perceived helicopters to be flying in the area of the airport near the point we witnessed the lights ascending.  The lights were red, similar to radio tower lighting. The light to the southwest most point merely extinguished, and being distracted, but not seeing the others, they too apparently went out. My initial assessment is that they were some man made thing, such as \"Sky Lanterns\" lifted by balloon or the heat rising from a candle, but problems exist with this theory.  1. They were launched near the County Airport, which I would suppose to be forbidden for a legal launch, as interference to or confusion of air traffic may ensue.  2. To suppose that they were equipped with electrical power for lighting or being equipped with a candle should have provided the most recently launched light with the ability to travel from the southeast launch point to the southwest extinguish point before itself extinguishing, this clearly did not happen.  I returned to the house and alternately listened to a scanning radio for the police frequencies in my area of Pittsburgh and to Aircraft Frequencies collectively. Nothing was heard to indicate that any others had called to report this incident, nor were pilots, in their very brief communications, mentioning it.  I subsequently noted an establishment across the street from the County Airport as having a Grand Opening sign, but I'm not sure how old the sign is. I drove past the County Airport travelling to work, on following days, but did not notice anything to account for the lights. We perused the media for a hint of a man made cause, but found none. We found this reporting page as a result.",

In the sky, a large orange sphere floated into view slightly south in the sky.  It loitered for a minute or so, and then rocketed off into the eastern sky.  No noise, consistent acceleration.  Within 5 minutes fighter jets flew past following the path of the orb.   He promptly called the Air Force, and got on his HAM radio.   Do not recall what the explanation was.

As I approached Club One at 6325 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA, 15206, I noticed initially 2 red balls in the sky, as if a group of helicopters were approaching.  Then I noticed 2 more.  There appeared to be 1 leading and the other 3 following.  But, they made no noise.   I pulled over in the parking lot that adjoins the gym near the McDonald's.  As I parked, I noticed them flying towards the townhomes across the street toward the Shadyside area.  I took a few pictures.  I was upset I couldn't get video because I just returned from vacation and didn't have enough space for video.   Then a larger one appeared which was about 2.5x's there size.  But I didn't think I captured it because of the lights from the McDonald's sign.   I also captured the 4 smaller ones, and unbeknownst to me, in the 1 picture with the illuminated McDonald's sign, if you enlarge it, you can see the shape of the actual object and the red going from back to front in a wave like  design.  But behind it, a few days later I noticed a blue glow.   When I enlarged the picture there appears to be a blue circular craft. And between the 1st one in that picture and blue craft their appears to be an irregular, rectangular shaped object that is not illuminated.  So there were possibly 7 total objects.   I have attached the 3 photos.  Please magnify for detail.

      "story": "Red Round Glowing Light. Still except once made a small triangle. Maybe some orange lights. Disappeared by shrinking. I saw a red light in the sky that was too large to be a planet as I was heading to the store.  To get a better look (because I was convinced I was looking at a plane or drone) I drove to view the object better.  It was late, between 10:30 pm and 11:00pm.  I pulled onto a dark street that overlooked a field were Kelton Elementary School once stood.  As I watched, What I 1st thought was moving was in fact still.  The object seemed to be glowing red (sometimes I thought I saw orange).  The size kept changing..it seemed to shrink a bit. At one point the red light moved, slightly in a triangle shape. The red light was too far into the sky to be a drone.  I did not notice any other lights in the sky, but for stars.  It was making me crazy that I had no one to witness this, and my cell phone was dead.  I suddenly saw 2 teenage girls in the field to my left.  I shouted down to them and asked if they too could see the light from where they stood (I was up higher on the street, and the field was below me).  At 1st they could not see it because they were looking in the wrong direction.  Once they spotted it, they both yelled...what is that.  All the sudden it began to shrink in size until it was gone..about 3 seconds.  They both started shouting what was that..thanked me for showing to them..and I drove off.  The light was too far away to be a drone and way too far in the sky.  Too see my vantage point, you can google Key Stone Oaks High School,  My Lebanon, PA.  I was parked on Delwood Ave. in Dormont, PA.  I'd say I was looking toward the Southern Sky when I saw it.  This is driving me crazy!!  What did I see?",

I opened my window and looked up to see a helicopter at about 600ft. altitude flying directly below and behind a large triangle object at about 1500ft. altitude.  The helicopter and triangle object were traveling Eastward.  The helicopter was lit underneath and appeared to be military, possibly UH-1N.  The triangle object was very slow moving at about 50 knots.  The triangle made no perceptible sound.  The triangle had large, round, diffuse white lights on each corner, a large faint yellowish/orange light in the center, and a small strobing red light off center to the rear of the craft.  I estimate the size of the triangle to be about 300ft. from corner to corner.  The helicopter broke course and headed Westward at low altitude along the Allegheny river then down the Ohio river while the triangle continued slowly Eastward until out of view.

I am a kind of guy that when he sees something unexplainable like this, he just considers it unknown yet strange.  I have a balcony to which I go out to smoke.  Being as how I live in the city it is very rare to see stars.  So when I recognize something that reminds me of a star I stare at it (I love stars.)  Every time I see an unidentified glowing object or \u201cflying object\" I stare at them to make sure I\u2019m not crazy and or to validate the realness.  I went out to smoke and I noticed the \u201cstar\u201d I was looking at was indeed not a star.  And it was seemingly moving against the laws of physics. As if it could go through time or something.  As I noticed that one I had noticed 2 others doing the same thing.  These bluish glowing orbs were moving short distances at breakneck speeds.  I have noticed these same phenomena in the past.  Even having intelligent adults look in wonderment.  That is all that happened in this instance.  The other must tell story is about a year ago during the late summer to fall months.  I had just got to my girlfriends mothers house (I lived there) and on the horizon my girlfriend, her mother, and I had witnessed a giant (10 times bigger than the moon perceptually) orange sphere.  It was almost exactly like the depictions of USO\u2019s.  Except there was no large body of water anywhere near me.  My girlfriends mother just shrugged it off while I was so lost and curious.  There is constant sightings of UFO\u2019s in my area.  We even had a woman In Pittsburgh last august make it on the news for seeing something strange  In the sky.  She calls the police and even the police think its weird.  Wish we could know what the phenomena is or is caused by.",

It did not have any blinking lights on it, like planes do. The object was moving from the SW to the SE.  My son who is an adult also saw the object.  The sky was fairly clear except for a few big puffy clouds.  We could see very well as there was a full moon.  When the object came very close to this one cloud there was a bright flash of light as it appeared to enter the cloud.  It appeared to almost spark.  We never saw it exit the cloud and then the oddest part was the cloud that it entered totally disappeared.  It took probably less than 3 mins for this cloud to evaporate, we could see it disappearing. The other clouds that were in the sky stayed the same.  There was not any wind or storms in the area when this happened.  The other odd thing was several dogs started barking very loudly when this was happening.",

The sky was clear and the moon was out (past full moon stage). I have frequented this library day and evening for the past 20 years and I\u2019m familiar with the typical lights present at night. As I was walking to my car from the closed library, I noticed two lights at about 45\u00b0 approaching from the Eastward direction travelling Westward.  The lights were separated a little less than 3\u00b0 ; the top light was white while the bottom one was a red blinking light.  I wondered if they were stationary or moving so I got into my car and used the oil change reminder sticker on my inside windshield to measure; yes they were moving slowly and moving in together at the same speed. I got out of the car to observe and try to take a picture/video. After a minute, this slowly travelling object showed its profile to me; it was a triangular! -shaped UFO with lights (portal lights?) highlighting the whole shape of the UFO a total of about 1\u00b0 width. The edges were not sharp, they were curved. After it passed, I hurried and drove to an adjacent church where I could get a better view. From this vantage point, I saw it calmly proceed in the Westward direction toward the horizon.",
