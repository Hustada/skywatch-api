      "story": "War of the Worlds It was the early 70's. It got very hot at night and we used to sleep every night in tents in the back yard to stay cool. We were sitting beside our tent and I looked up at the stars as I always loved to look at them. There was a red star that caught my eye and all of a sudden, a red light about the same size of the star came from it and moved at least 5 time faster across the sky than any plane I ever saw to this day. I ran in the house to tell my grandmother about it. She came out within seconds and it had already reached the other side of the house. We were all in awe over this and then all of a sudden there were many of these lights all looking like they were coming from every star in the sky. It was really weird because they all looked like they were the same color of the twinkling star they came from. This was definately not a meteor shower. I watch them every chance I can. All the lights moved from one end of the sky to the other crossing each others path as if they were just missing each other. They never left a trail and just looked like stars moving across the sky. The lights never went out and it lasted at least a half hour. They never blinked like the stars they seemed to have came from.  It kind of freak my other family members and after a small amount of time they would not even admit it happened. There was a write-up in the paper shortly after that, that many people had saw the same thing. I can't remember exactly what the article said but I know they didn't have and explaination of what they were.  After awhile they started to get dimmer until they all disappeared. It was definately an experience I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

However, my eyes were drawn back to it as I saw it move from north to south and fade out.  I have seen many meteors (was awake for the Leonid showers) and this was moving too slow for a meteor...although, at that altitude (not sure but it seemed way up there) it must have been moving along.  Thought maybe it was a satellite that just happened to catch the sun reflecting off of it but I then saw two airplanes move in that direction.  Those were easy to identify since they had the traditional blinking lights.  The two planes appeared to be at the same altitude and moving in the same direction as the white light was moving.

      "story": "dark object with strobe/beacon.stationary over Interstate 90 near Erie,PA We were driving eastbound on I86 (then called NY route 17) one January night around 10pm.We had just turned onto I86 from I90 near Erie,PA. On the westbound side of the highway there are two steel frame towers (communication towers I assume),right up near the road,that each have a light at the top that slowly flash like the lights on radio towers.I've seen these towers many times while driving through the area. So when we got another half mile or so down the road,I was surprised to see what at first looked like a third tower.Actually I assumed it was another tower because of the strobe/beacon that I saw flashing. As we got closer I noticed that the light was flashing much more quickly than the lights on the towers.(and,by the way,flashing about twice the speed of a normal aircraft strobe that can be seen in the sky on any given night.) I said to my wife,\"What the hell is that?\" She only glanced at the light.(We were returning from the Erie,PA veterens hospital because her dad was there recovering from a collapsed lung...so she was thinking about her dad and not a light flashing along the expressway) As we got closer,still...almost beneath this thing,the strobe was obscured by the 'body' of the object.It was a very dark night with no moon.Whatever this thing was,it was as black as the sky.I couldnt really tell how big it was as it was invisible against the dark sky.No outline was visible at all. Now here is the thing that tells me this was not a stationary helicopter or something...and also the part that scared me. As we passed the object I kept looking up at it through my drivers side window. I saw a rectangular opening on the bottom of the object. The opening was about the size of a small car. I could see a grate or screen up inside there through which was visible a pulsing,glowing orange/red light which sort of looked like the pulsing glow of the hot coals at the base of a campfire. I've seen lots of helicopters and they all have lights and numbers on the bottom or say police or sheriff and have visible landing wheels or skids on them.I've never seen a helicopter a with pulsing,glowing rectangular opening on the bottom. By the way,the object was close up to the road...just over the tree line.The opening was about as high as the top of a 4 or 5 story building.We heard no sound as it was January and we had the car windows rolled up tight...and we were driving around 60 miles an hour. I have to admit that I began to panic a bit on the inside! My heart began to race as I realised I was looking at something very different than anything I had ever seen before in the sky! For some reason I had the feeling that whatever it was,it 'knew' I was looking at it...as if all the other cars that were going by didnt notice anything strange...as if I was the only one who noticed that this was NOT another communications tower! For a moment I feared this thing would come after us!My panic began to subside as we left the object further and further behind. I watched it in my side mirror and glanced over my shoulder at it as we continued down the road. It may have been an illusion,but I thought it looked like it moved back away from the road about 30 feet in an instant! ...like it moved in a wink! ...but it could have been an illusion because all I could see over my shoulder was the strobe blinking in the dark sky...and we were driving. As we rounded a bend and passed under a bridge I was not able to see the object any longer. My wife said it seemed weird but like I said she was preoccupied with thoughts of her elderly father we had just left back at the VA hospital. This whole thing happened in less than one minute as we drove along the highway.Just for the record,there were plenty of other cars driving in both directions...I'd say light to moderate traffic for the area...so others must have seen it.If anyone else thought it was strange I do not know.

I and a friend were positioned facing north looking out over the lake. light rain, cool temperature for early part of August.  With the naked eye, I confirmed with my friend that there were lights out on the lake (28 miles across) as seen first with the naked eye.  Then I asked my friend if he had a pair of binoculars.  Through the binoculars it was determined at first that a small boat appeared on fire.  This first bright light was furthest East in its proximity.  Then, on closer inspection I noticed and confirmed with my friend that what we were witnessing was NOT a little boat on fire, but fire balls descending extremely slow from the underside of this low slung storm cloud.  No identifiable sounds were heard in the vacinity. No helicopters, scrambled jets nor weather planes.  The story here is eiree as the fireballs continued to fall from the sky and as the first one went down behind the horizon, another one immediately appeared and began to fall.  This happened for a period of an hour to 90 minutes.  I was a little concerned, not knowing what was happening and decided to leave the neighborhood where this sighting was occurring-- a quiet neighborhood that lines the shore of Lake Erie.   After witnessing at least thirteen of these fireballs, I left the area (my friend lives in the house overlooking the lake and was concerned as well, but not as much as I was.) I hoped that the local news had picked up on this story, but no one has ever reported any similar sightings at the same location, nor did I feel compelled to inform the Lawrence Park police.  I did not want to bring attention to the quiet little neighborhood, plus it was raining and the folks all seemed to be sleeping and not witnessing this.   Too bad, this is definitely one for the books.  I wished that I had had a powerful video camera to capture this phenomenon.",

I pointed it out to my sister and we began discussing how that could be possible.  I said that it couldn't be a star, because the axis of the earth doesn't move fast enough to change our viewpoint on stars overnight. As we were talking about this, the object moved sideways very quickly in the sky, and the light started dimming, until it looked as if it were trying to mimic a star.  We kept looking at it and were in disbelief, when suddenly the light went completely off, leaving only a faint reddish-blue point in the sky.

      "story": "Orange Flaming Orbs fall from the sky over Lake Erie, August, 2007 The Event occurred during a late summer rain storm. Although the rain was not heavy, the dark cloud over Lake Erie was distinct. The phenomena observed began as a casual observance of a single speck of light. We observed what appeared from the shoreline as a light perhaps a mile or two offshore. The only way we could observe this occurence was with an average powered pair of field binoculars. At first looking through the binoculars it appeared as if it might be a small boat, but closer examination revealed that this was something \"on fire\". I quickly alerted my companion to look into the binoculars to get his opinion. He also saw this ball of flame. What happened after this first encounter was quite startling. Let me say that I have never had a close encounter and am suspect of anything currently being written about the UFO phenomenology. However the unfolding events of that night have not only startled me, but have stayed with me for the last three years. O! nly today was I able to define my observances based on other eye-witnesses who had similar sightings. They have described what they similarly saw as \"orange flaming orbs\". Other descriptions were ascribed to them, but in my case the \"orange flaming orbs\" fits the description perfectly. I thought that one orb appearance was enough, but what makes this an even more intriguing mystery is that after this first orb disappeared beyond the Lake Erie's horizon line, another one began to fall from the low hanging dark storm cloud. I have read other accounts and descriptions of \"ascending lights\" and fast lateral moving lights but these were not like that at all. We watched as consecutive flaming orbs fell very slowly from the sky and eventually into the water. What is also amazing is how each was orchestrated in its falling velocity (extremely slow-- slower than a parachutist, so we knew this wasn't a nighttime military mission) and also that the intensity of the light stayed consistent-- from the time it appeared coming out of the dark cloud until it hit the water's horizon line. I should note that there were no sounds being emitted and no sounds of jets, airplane or helicopter engines were heard. The fact that it was a drizzling rain (with no lightning, I might add) made it impossible for this to be man-made-- such as what I thought it might be: a summer \"art performance\" by some of the local artists. No one in their right mind would want to be out in this weather on the vastness of Lake Erie. No ot! her lights appeared-- suche as boats or planes. The house we observed all of this from is remote from the city so no street, traffic or building lights could have interfered. As much as I am recreating this story, we unfortunately had no access to good night time cameras or videos, but I would testified unequivocally that this was a phenomena that deserved a full and further investigation. To continue with the observation, we stood on the back porch with a full panoramic view to the west toward Cleveland and to the east toward Buffalo. We were facing north toward Canada when these lights were observed. In the same fashion as described earlier, we observed at least 16 of these same flaming orbs extremely slowly fall from the sky and into the waters. As each one disappeared the next one began to come out from the underside of the cloud. This event went on for at least one hour. There were more that continued to fall and perhaps a whole string of them from our line of sight and down toward Buffalo, but I actually felt frightened (amazed and excited as well) and wanted to report this occurance to the Lawrence Park police, but being a skeptic and resp! ectful of this tiny suburb and being late at night I hesitated to call anyone to bring undo attention to the neighborhood. I looked in the Erie Times News the next day to see if there was a story about this light phenomena, but did not find anything, nor was there anything on the television. This event has stayed with me since 2007. It is only today that I found your reporting website and also found better descriptors based on other observances.",

It was a mixed clouds/ clear skies evening, I was leaving work when a strange engine noise drew my attention to the sky.  The object I noticed nose dived then plateaud  suddenly to about 1000 feet.  The object had no lights, and the front of the craft was pointed.  The wings of the craft drew back at a sharp angle.  The rear of the vehicle had one engine but no exhaust/flames coming from it. The engine produced an irregular, loud noise, unlike any aircraft i've ever heard before.It had no propellers, was like a jet engine.  The sound coming from the aircraft was very loud and had a very deep clanking noise,although the speed of the craft did not match the sound it was producing.  It was heading north for a few seconds and abruptly disappeared because of it's speed.  It was impossible to track because there were no lights marking it's spot in the sky.",

That they have these disc fireworks that go up and then shoot to the side, and they come in all colors.  This was solid red, brighter than any firework I had seen.  And if it were a firework, why was it hovering?  I also want to point out that it was really high up, and I have never seen a firework that high up.",

It was huge - actually about the size of a blimp, but again with some features removed.   This coupled with the fact that I have never seen any sort of zeppelin in my area before, made it clear that this was no craft I knew about.  I could see it for about two minutes before it was obstructed from view by my neighbors' house.  It reappeared on the other side and eventually disappeared from my window.

      "story": "Object with a single, white light appeared over city and Lake Erie and moved in ways I have never seen any aircraft move. I have been a police officer for ten years, and I served active duty in the United States Army in a reconnaissance unit.  One of my duties in the military was to observe and be able to identify aircraft from many countries, primarily those from the United States and the former Soviet Union.  I am also a huge fan of helicopter aviation. I was working patrol on the night of 7/16/11 on the 2230-0630 shift.  I was in uniform and in a marked patrol car.  While patrolling on a main street in town, I was driving southeast away from the lake and toward the downtown area.  At approximately 2352 hrs., I noticed a single, white light in the sky moving northwest.  The light appeared to be at an altitude of approximately 1,000-2,000 feet over the downtown area.  I first thought the object was a helicopter.  Just up the street from me was a large hospital which averages probably 4-5 medical helicopter transports a week.  I am very familiar with the medical helicopters which frequent my area, and after a few seconds I realized that what I was seeing was not a helicopter.  I also heard absolutely no sound from the object. As the light came toward me, I realized that it had no navigational or hazard lights (the green and red lights which flash on an aircraft).  It had a single, white light.  It was very bright at first.  As it got closer to being directly overhead, I noticed that the light appeared to be cigar shaped.  But as it got even closer to being overhead, the light seemed to dim.  By the time it was overhead (approximately one minute since I first saw it), it was as dim as most of the stars in the sky.  In fact, if it hadn't been moving, I probably would have thought that it was a star. I actually stopped my patrol car in the middle of the street and had to stick my head out of my driver's side window to look up at the object because it was directly overhead.  The object continued to move northwest, but it was dim and appeared to be much higher than when I first saw it.  In fact, it appeared then that it was 10,000 feet or higher. Then I was amazed when the object stopped dead in it's tracks and began to zig and zag, back and forth!  It went in all directions.  I would estimate that if it was 10,000 high it was probably moving maybe 200 feet in each direction around the point where it had stopped. It became difficult for me to watch the object with my head sticking out the car window and looking over the roof of the car to my west, so I made a u-turn and parked along the curb.  I could now see the object by looking out of my window toward the west.  Shortly after I parked, I phoned my wife to tell her what I was seeing.  My cell phone indicated that I called my wife at 2353 hrs. on 7/16/11. Just after I started talking to my wife, the object stopped zigging and zagging and it began to move toward the east.  Just then, another police unit with two officers pulled up and asked what I was doing.  I ended the phone call with my wife and I informed the officers about the object that I was watching.  We then exited our respective vehicles while we watched the object.  Both officers saw what I was seeing.  One of them believed it to be an aircraft.  The other officer said she wasn't sure what it was. As we watched the object continue east, we noticed an aircraft far out in front of it, also flying east.  The object and the aircraft appeared to be around the same altitude, but the object had become so dim that it was hard to determine how high it was.  In fact, several times the object's light appeared to fade out completely and then quickly fade back in.  However, at no time did the light of the object appear to flash or blink. All three of us watched the object move east and, once again, it stopped in mid flight and began to zig and zag around the point it stopped.  The one officer continued to believe that the object was an aircraft, and the other officer said she didn't know what it was.  Then the other officers had to move their vehicle because they had stopped in the travel lane and they were blocking traffic.  I got back into my vehicle and drove east and parked in a parking lot one block east of my original location where I continued to watch the object.  It continued east and its light faded in and out a few more times.  I lost track of where the aircraft, which I had seen in front of it, had flown.  Then I received a call for service from my dispatcher and I had to leave the area.  The total time I watched the object was approximately 15 minutes. Later that night I looked to the sky in the direction I last saw the object but I didn't see it again.  Through the course of the night I did see two meteorites, one to the north of town over the lake and one to the south.  However, I am familiar with what meteorites look like and the object I watched was NOT a meteorite. Later in my shift I tried to call the local international airport to see if they had any aircraft or any other contacts on radar at that time.  But I only got an automated system and was never able to get through to anyone there.",

As I pointed out to my friend that I didn\u2019t think it was an airplane due to its movement (of which there was none, it was just hovering there), it rolled (it was almost like a tumbler rolling in midair), and spun overhead.  With that simple twist, it became a bright circle, and it shot ahead of us towards the lake.  Within seconds the point of light was across Lake Erie, towards Canada, and could not be seen anymore.  It left no trail, no sounds, nothing.   The person I was with is a skeptic, and even he was dumbfounded as to how it could just disappear without a trace.   I was able to snap a photo on my cell phone camera, right when it was doing its little tumble.  It is not the greatest, but you can tell there is definitely something there.",

It then changed direction and turned green then it propelled downwards as if it was going into Lake Erie.  It was too fast to be a plane and as it changed direction we ruled out the possibility of a shooting star.  We got out of the car and waited for a while.  After a minute of no sightings we decided to drive towards the area we thought that we saw it fall however after waiting by the lake for 15 minutes we saw nothing so headed back to the camp we were staying at. Later on that night I was sitting out side of my cabin and saw two very interesting things. First as i looked up there was a grouping of 3 stars in a small triangle but when i looked closely the top star in the triangle was moving slightly to the right and the snapping back to the original position like it was attached to a piece of elastic. The second was a constant flashing light coming from the Lake Erie direciton.  A pure white light at tree level.  As I walked towards the direction, there were no cars or lights to produce the flash but it continued for a few minutes.",

There was no noise and it was silent. No one sitting outside of their houses seemed to notice it being that they were looking in the other direction at fireworks.  There were four of us in the car who all seen it.  My husband tried to convince everyone that it was a Chinese candle balloon, but the funny thing was the last time we looked back at it before it was out of our view, you could see two planes flying towards it-all of which looked like ants in its giant comparison.

      "story": "Two groups of bright red lights hovered and moved independently in all directions for about 10 minutes over Erie, PA. I was walking out of a convenience store to my car a little before 8:30pm on September  23, and I noticed 3 very bright red lights in the sky, hovering in a triangle formation.  I couldn't figure out what they were; it was very cloudy, so I realized these couldn't be stars or planets because they were below the cloud cover.  As I continued to watch them, I noticed they were moving, flying up, down, left, right; and they moved independent of each other, so they were not connected to one aircraft.  As I watched the three red lights, a fourth one came flying from over the store into my field of vision very fast, then stopped on a dime near the other three and just hovered there next to them.  Then all 4 of them hovered, and would individually fly slowly to the left and down in my field of vision.  Then, 2 of them flew very, very close together, like they were almost touching, then separated again.  Then, one by one, they each appeared to flicker out--which prob! ably means they flew higher up into the cloud cover and out of my sight.  I watched this group for about 3 or 4 minutes. I sat there in my car a few more minutes, and sure enough, two more red lights flew from over the store into my field of vision, so they were flying from south to north.  I called my parents, who live a block away from the store, and they ran outside and saw these ones.  As I was talking to them on the phone, another one flew from south to north and joined these other two.  They hovered and flew subtly back and forth, independently, for several minutes.  Then, just like before, two of them flew so close together that they appeared to touch.  Then, they each flickered out, one by one, disappearing into the clouds. A friend of mine, who lives 1 block north of the store, said that a group of people were standing in a parking lot across the street from his house, and they were pointing and shouting things about the sky.  He regrets not going outside to look for himself. I don't know if these events are related to these UFO's, but the Internet stopped working for several hours all over the east side of Erie, and a firefighter friend of mine reported that the power went out in half of the borough of Wesleyville, which is where I saw these objects. I personally witnessed these two groups of red UFO's for about 10 minutes total, but they were already in the sky when I came out of the store, so I don't know how long they were visible before I saw them.  I don't know if the second group of 3 UFO's were the same ones I saw minutes earlier (in the first group of 4), or if there were 7 different UFO's.  There was no sound associated with this event. I am 37 years old, and I've never seen anything like this before.  I am a church music director, and I was coming home from working with my church's youth group when I saw these UFO's.",

I looked up in the sky  facing West, and saw this very large ball of light.  By natural instict, I hit him and yelled, \"Check it out a shooting star!\"  He turned around and missed it.  It fell behind a building in a direction toward downtown toward Lake Erie.  I thought I explained that it wasn't like a normal shooting star.  It was MASSIVELY Larger.  Another student was on campus by us and he looked at me asking if I saw that thing fall in the guy.  I agreed.  And we just looked at each other and he said, \"Do you think it was a UFO?\"  I said, it clearly wasn't a shooting star.   We both discussed and shared Identical description of the falling object.  It looked at if a massive form of light was behind a cloud, it changed colors rapidly from like a lilac, to a turqouise, to a seafoam green sometimes more than one color at once, it was just fluidly multiple colors.  The size was clearly bigger than! any manmade aircraft. It gasous size was probably the size of our sun during the winter sky.  Like the size of one's thumbnail.  Big.    We both saw it fall in the same direction, down toward Lake Erie, but it fell behind the large building on campus.  It moved quietly and at a constant speed, the direction appeared though as it was crashing, but it fell being the building. But I guess it best to sum up we saw:  A large light source much bigger than a man made air craft crashing through the sky covered in a turquoise/violet/seafoam green light.",

It was still light outside but nearing dusk; I was walking outside and ahead of me and to the left (northwest of Erie) a yellowish-white fireball dropped out of the sky, splitting off at one point so there was one larger and one smaller piece beside it falling.  This may have been a meteor or satellite fragment, and was falling more like a huge burning ember and not like a typical meteor streak.  It appeared to be relatively close but the other person who saw it was also in Erie, and I'm unaware of additional reports from other nearby cities that may help to triangulate the exact location.  I noticed it start falling at about 45 degrees below the horizon and it \"fizzled out\" about 20 degrees later (about halfway to the ground from the time it was first seen). I've seen a good number of fireballs and meteors, but only a handful of these close ember-like balls over many years.  I felt extremely charged up after the sighting and couldn't quite explain why, but it was like something changed in the air; other people who hadn't seen it also seemed extra charged up.   The next morning the UFOs were seen over Breckenridge, about 60 miles away as the crow flies. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is an amendment to the report just submitted from Erie.

      "story": "First thought it was a Lifestar medivac helicopter taking off from Saint Vincent Hospital which is nearby. The witness works at a bayside outdoor bar as a doorman.  He was collecting cover charges from patrons as they entered the bar and appreciating the bayfront skyline, most notably the Port Erie Bicentennial Tower which dominates the skyline view of Dobbins landing which is the name of the district that the bar and tower are situated in.   He first noticed the object because he believed that it was a Lifestar medivac helicopter taking off from Saint Vincent Hospital which is near the place of the sighting.  It began blinking different colors alternating between red, green and then blue and white at random intervals.  It stopped and hovered in mid air and then began making bizarre right angle turns and wild oscillation in altitude before beginning lazy swoops over the bay and then heading over to Presque Isle across the bay before coming back towards the bar. (out of respect for his employers he will let them remain anonymous) it moved from NE to SW, circled the tower a few times and then began to sweep back and forth over Dobbins landing.   His immediate reaction was to observe it and conjecture what it could possibly have been.  It was too small and too quiet to be a helicopter, but the range was too far for a civilian drone and the night was too dark to be taking drone photography.  He attempted to point out the craft to a leaving patron; who was unfortunately too intoxicated to take notice of the craft.  The craft then traveled up above State Street proceeding to the S and then ascended above the cloud cover and dissipated into the cloud cover or was obscured by the light pollution of the city.  His immediate reaction was to tell his friends and immediately try and write down everything he had seen in complete detail.  He communicated this via a smartphone to three of his friends.",

      "story": "Bright flashes in eastern sky appearing to come from the ground, noticed at a distance in the Easter sky that there was a bright object flashing bright and not moving. Sky is very clear it is still there now. Used binoculars and the object seemed very large stationary and flashing red blue and white lights. It slowly moved south then back to original position. Upstairs through the window with binoculars the object appears to be wide. It had abruptly moved south and still is the same size and not moving.",

      "story": "They all came from a dark area of the sky. But like they were coming out of something darker than the space around them. Like watching items come off a conveyor belt in a factory. It was almost mechanical in feel.  They all traveled from the southwest to the northeast. They went in a mostly single file pattern. One after another.  All looked similar to venus looks from earth(bright white lights)  They all continued northeast until fading out of view. Took about 20-30 seconds to cross the sky beginning to end.  Every few objects another would travel next to one like an escort. On northern side of line of objects.   I saw like a flare type white streak under them a time or two.  I could see sever small dimmer objects observing from what appeared further away. I would guess 3-4.  If I were to guess direction of objects travel I would guess Hudson Bay or Baffin Island from southeast Kansas.  I was so in awe I didn't think to try and capture with phone until afterwards. Used old picturesto give example.  I have seen a lot if odd thing's from the wilds of Idaho to Texas my entire life. I watch things by my nature. I never ever saw unknown objects so numerical or almost robotic in feel. Nothing that I felt compelled to share, ever.  There was air traffic and don't know how this wouldn't be seen from a large radius.   It was very clear and very open and easy to see. I am still rattled 14+ hours later",
