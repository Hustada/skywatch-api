So posting this is not easy for me, but this is too unexplainable to keep all to myself. This entire event happened within a five minute period and I had 4 other eyewitnesses.  I noticed this object in the sky while helping my son fly a kite in the park. It took me about thirty seconds to realize it was not a kite as it was about 300 feet higher than the kite I was flying. The object seemed to be stationary, but I soon realized that it was slowly moving higher and vertical.  As I ran to another friend also flying a kite and asked him \"what's that in the sky\" he was baffled as well. I then grabbed my camera and start taking pictures. My camera is expensive and takes great shots but I'm an amateur photographer and could not lock the focus on an object that was moving away, getting smaller and had nothing but blue sky's and clouds as a backdrop.  I took a total of 10 pictures and to my amazement, one out of ten came out perfectly clear (by luck) to reveal something that is very hard to explain. I cannot describe the object other than it looks like a very large white camera with a large lens looking downward with four booster rockets and two fuel pods all of which are perfectly symmetrical in shape!  Yeah, I know; crazy huh?  As I tried to rationalize what it might be, I dismissed that it was a weather balloon, US aircraft, satellite and defiantly not a kite. What ever it was, it wasn't moving with the wind and it was still visible far beyond the cloud layer meaning that the sunlight was reflecting off of this object.  I dare not show or send this photo out to anyone unless they are willing to pay very well for it. If there really are aliens and spaceships from another world, I may have one of few real pictures as proof!  The most logical but still crazy explanation I can come up with other than it being from another world is that some foreign country has developed advance spying technology that can silently hover over American land and then return home at altitudes over 40,000 feet!",

      "story": "Green glowing UFOs and some that look like stars in the shape of circles with many encounters. The first encounter was with two friends I no longer have contact with.  It was probably about 5-6 years ago around 10:00p.m.  We we're skateboarding behind the gym of an elementary school and decided to take a rest.  We lodged our skateboards into these vents against the gym wall and layed back on them.  We had a clear view of the sky that night and I noticed a green star in the sky.  It was bright and very distinguishable amongst all the other stars in the sky.  I pointed it out to my two friends and they noticed it right away.  We layed back and watched it for about 10 seconds when all of a sudden it came down right in front of our faces, all the way from high up in the sky right down in front of us in a split second.  The object was emitting a green glow that was very bright, but I didn't notice anything else light up around us.  It was completely silent making no sound at all, and this object was big.  My friends and I made no sound and just stared at it.  I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It probably hovered in front of us for around 10 seconds, as if it were staring back at us.  Afterwards it shot off back into space as fast as it had come down in front of us and we lost sight of it a second after it shot directly back up into the atmosphere.  Afterwards my friends stood up screaming their heads off and running.  I didn't know what to do or think so I just followed them.  Years and years later my friends and I were just discussing UFO encounters.  This wasn't my first either, but it is the most significant as it leads to a chain of sightings.  So anyways, I told them about this one and they realized that we could try and head to the school gym to try and see if we could spot them again.  I thought it was a great idea and got excited, so we left.  At the gym we waited for a while, and sure enough my friend spotted one out of the corner of his eye.  It looked like a star, but it was movinhg, and then a few more started popping up and moving around in the sky.  They looked ! like sta rs, however some would fly low and close to the mountain next to us and these were green leaving green trails behind them.  These would move fast and then slowly, and then all of a sudden they would jet accross the sky leaving trails behind them.  We could spot up to even 6 at a time easily.  Some were straight above us, some were off in the distance.  We watched these from around 12:00 midnight until 5:00-6:00a.m.  after the sun comes up we could no longer see them.  I gathered more friends over time and we would make routine visits to the gym to spot more UFOs.  Sometimes we would see a lot, sometimes none at all.  One time one flew close to us, we could just tell it was close, especially by lining it up with the mountain next to us.  This one flew slow and was about the size of a quarter if you were to hold one at an arm's length in front of your face.  It flew from above our heads, all the way to the other side of the field and eventually passed the mountains and dissapeared behind some clouds.  There is no way these objects could be aircraft, it's impossible.  Nothing can move that slowly and then speed up that fast and maneuver they way they did.  Sometimes they would fly directly at each other as if they were going to collide and move away right before they would touch, and move at extreme speeds.  These were still flying around, the last time I checked about a year ago.  Sometimes I could see them from my apartment balcony, like one would just jet down really fast and dissapear.  I mainly only saw them at the school gym though.  I would love to have people investigate this.  I want this to go places and I was watching the National Geographic channel and heard about this place on a UFO show that they had on.  Please, check this out!  Oh yeah I forgot to mention that we brought video cameras afterwards to try and videotape some of these UFOs.  We were unable to capture any of them with our camera because the sky was just black and the video camera was horrible at picking anything up in that type of! setting Another thing is that the video cameras shut off at the same time while we were trying to record.  The batteries weren't drained or anything, but for some reason the cameras just shut off completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

I turned 180 degrees around and saw an object moving at a uniform distance above the roof of the house in front of me, about 2 ft. above the roof, coming towards me from the backside of the structure, and it occurred to me that it was maintaining a uniform distance above the roof as opposed to an arc over the house from the other side or a path that would lead it way past the house---it was 'hugging' the roof as if on purpose. The object was a sphere, maybe 1 1/2X the size of a basketball, emitting a VERY bright blue light but a light that didn't hurt my eyes as I watched it come over the roof to stop about 5 feet above the ground maybe 15 feet in front of me, between the house and where I was standing. It emitted NO NOISE, NO ODOR, and no noticable spinning or other movement---it just hovered there---I then began to think---I believe that all of my mental processes had ceased as I watched it, from complete amazement and captivation, with no fear or any emotion. However, as soon as I began to \"think\" about it, this object went from right in front of me to over the horizon, perhaps 1/2 mile away up the hill I was on, and disappeared. Again, NO NOISE ans NO anything---it just \"left\".  As I ponder what I have seen, the most powerful part of my memory concerns the following: I believe that it would have stayed there in front of me until I began to \"think\" about it, and as soon as my brain kicked into gear, it took off at light-speed+ to get away from me, protect itself or whatever. It could differentiate between observation and analysis---these are just my feelings---no proof of anything, nor any harm done.  I have decided to call it a \"probe\", something sent to gather inormation as I saw how it was hugging the roof-line as though it had a useful \"range\", and I would go farther to guess that what it \"records\" is brain wave activity or something like that---based on it's reaction to my \"discerning\" that it was there.  I'd like to know the answer someday----you never can know for sure!!  Aloha,  ((name and address deleted))  Malulani St. Kaneohe, HI 96744 ((personal data deleted))",

      "story": "On the evening of December 21, 2007, I was driving on Interstate H-1 on the island of Oahu.  The incident occurred at approximately 7:13 pm Hawaii Standard Time (UTC-10) and I was on my way home after attending a Christmas party at the Pearl Ultralounge.   The night was black, no stars, with light, intermittent rain falling.  As I drove down H-1, there were numerous other cars present when the incident occurred.   I observed in the sky an unusual aircraft flying overhead from the mountains towards the Pacific Ocean with two extremely bright lights (a small white light, and an extremely bright pink light) far too bright to be normal anti-collision lights.  My estimation is that the distance of the object from myself was probably less than five miles.  The object appeared to be operating at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet above ground level and maintained steady altitude as it headed towards the ocean, flying above what appeared to be the Kalihi area.  During that time, green fireworks were being fired over the city at that time, but the object I observed was by no means the explosion of a firework or a signal flare because it did not suddenly ascend or slowly descend as one might expect of a parachute-retarded flare; rather, the object moved slowly on a level flight path from the mountains to the ocean.   I could not see any distinguishing features on the object, because its lights were so bright.  As I drove down the road, I continued to visually track the object for a period of approximately two minutes, when suddenly the object disappeared completely.  I must emphasize strongly that the object did not \"fade away\" or fly behind a building or mountain causing it to be obscured from view, but rather completely vanished as if one minute it was there, the next minute it was gone. That evening I was completely alert, not fatigued in any way, and I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages.  I am not currently taking any form of medication and I am in good health.   My estimation is at that time of night and level of traffic, many people must have seen the object from H-1.  I was extremely disturbed by what I saw and felt compelled to report it.",

Honolulu resident Peter Hollingworth described as two lights circling in the sky, about 45 degrees above the horizon. Video of one of the lights was recorded from the Channel 2 SkyCam. \"These two little fireballs with a stream behind it,\" said Hollingworth.  \"Looked kind of like a shooting star, but it just kept going. They changed directions a few times, at first it was coming in then it turned, Then it went out then it came back in again\"  Hollingworth was surfing with his 12 year old son when the unexpected show began. \"I was a little concerned. I told him come over and sit with me - this might be the last surf session we ever have together because this thing's coming straight for Honolulu.  It looked deadly to me it was kind of spooky.\"   So what was it?  The National Weather Service says nothing showed up on their radar at the time of the sighting and the Federal Aviation Administration didn't report anything unusual. The U.S. military conducted a missile defense test off of Kauai Friday evening but the test didn't begin until 7:20 p.m. \"This in a sense is an unidentified flying object,\" said University of Hawaii astronomy professor Gareth Wynn-Williams.  \"It's something in the sky that's moving that we haven't identified.\"  Wynn-Williams believes there's a simple explanation behind the UFO\u2019s. \"It's probably a contrail of some kind,\" he said while watching video of one of the lights at his Kailua home. The professor says contrails are caused by high flying airplanes burning hydrogen based fuels. One of the byproducts of the fuel exhaust is water. \"The air is very cold so the water condenses and forms like drops very quickly and then these drops stay behind the plane until eventually they warm up and they evaporate.\"  Wynn-Williams doubts little green men from Mars are behind the UFO\u2019s. \"Some people just think differently than scientists and they like to look for the fanciest most exciting explanation. Those people would like to think it's little green men, I think that's very unlikely.\"  According to published reports this is not the first time a UFO has grabbed the attention of Hawaii residents. In December of 2004 an unexplained streak of light was captured by a camera on Haleakala moving southwest to northeast. No official explanation has been given for that UFO either. Video on www.khon.com ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at a still image, taken from the video, and the object appears to us to be a typical contrail.  PD))",

Then it moved right. then back to same spot. then it slowly moved away from the shore going back where it came from until I couldn't see it any more.  This is the first time I have ever publicly disclosed this sighting. I knew then  as I know now, It wasn't from this earth. I was 19 yrs old when that happened. I am now 54. I will never forget that night. I even rubbed my eyes in dis-belief a wew times, but it was real. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Everyone on was out of there houses and on the street heads gazing North at the lights.

It was around 8pm at night when my sister and I decided to go to the grocery store to buy a few things.  As I was about to get into the car, I saw a bright reddish-orange light in the sky moving slowly.  It was a shape of a circle.  My boyfriend was going to go home at that time and was about to leave.  I told him to stop the car and to look at the sky.  I asked him if that was a plane and he told me it was a small airplane.  But, I was thinking that it could not be a plane at all because it was moving too slowly and usually when you see airplanes at night you would see that it would have a blinking light and a sound passing thru.  This bright light I saw didn't have any sound and it was moving too slowly to even be an airplane. It was moving silently in the sky.  Plus, it was a bit cloudy at that time and this thing was flying low underneath the clouds.  My uncle was also out! side and it caught his eye.  We all were looking at it the whole time.  All of a sudden, that reddish-orange light I saw in the sky stopped moving.  Then, I told my boyfriend,\"is it just me because now that light just stopped in the sky and now it looks like a star, but it doesn't even look like a star.\"  Then, my boyfriend told me it wasn't just me, he also saw that thing move earlier and now it just stopped.  My uncle was also amazed. At that time, my sister was loosing her patience and was calling me to get into the car. I continued to look at it for another good five minutes.  It could not be a meteor or a comet.  It could not be a star because it wasn't twinkling at all. My mother also wanted to come to the grocery store and I looked at her and told her about what we were looking at in the sky.  As I was talking to my mother, my uncle yelled, \"wow, it just dissapeared that's really weird.\"  Then, I looked back in the sky and it was really gone. WEIRD! I dunno if it was a UFO an! d maybe it was something else.  Everytime I would tell somebody! about m y experience they would say maybe it was a star, satellite, or a comet. Who knows...

This is what caught my attention. I continued to watch at each stoplight as I drove home down Nimitz drive towards Waikiki. I did noticed two contrails following each other in rocket like arc. Then they would cross each other. I got home and looked at object with a pair of binoculars. There were three at this time. Only one came close enough for me to get a good look (about 8 seconds) I could clearly see that the closest object was a very bright silver triangle (could be from the bright sun reflection) the objects left short contrails that were shaped like a snakes tongue. These objects would perform criss cross maneuvers and sudden upward and downward arcs. I watched as a third object began to sort of dogfight with the two others. This was very high in the sky. Way above normal air traffic. After about another 5 minutes they disappeared out of site heading towards Molokai. I took about 10 photos. None are ve! ry good I only can see the contrails. The maneuvers did not seem out of this world. I was watching because they looked to be possibly, my first thought, cloud seeding because of the patterns. I don\u2019t think that was the case because the contrails were so short. I will attach some pictures. Did anyone else notice these strange aircraft?",

The location was over the ocean, some distance offshore of what would be considered as the Diamondhead or Waikiki/Honolulu area of Oahu. The green light flashed once, then streaked several miles to the left in a split second, flashed brightly once more, then went dark momentarily and flashed dimly once more before disappearing. I watched the area for 5 more minutes but didn't see another occurrence. Commercial aircraft are always passing through the same airspace as this sighting, and as I watched the area after this sighting there were a number of commercial flights moving slowly across the sky with their characteristic small flashing white lights. The speed, color and movement pattern of man-made craft and UFOs are entirely different and as a former flight student, I would never possibly confuse the two. I have seen the same thing before, from the other side of the island of Oahu, over Kaneohe Bay about 10 years ago. On that occasion there were two of us watching, and we saw the same thing and still talk about it. The green light and flight pattern for that older sighting were much the same as this sighting on 12/06/09, further validating these experiences for me. I checked the local news the next day and found no reports of sightings, but I find it hard to believe that I was the only witness.",

ALA WAI HARBOR xxxx Ala Moana Blvd. Honolulu Hawaii  Sitting on the bed of my truck with my friend at his boat slip. Two other neighboring men were hanging out on their boat.  We all looked up and saw something falling vertically fast, but no flames or fire like a meteor.  Object had a com trail.  Object fell right behind one of the major hotel buildings on Ala Moana Blvd when it flashed twice about 100 ft above ground.  This flash seemed to be a double flash and very bright blue/white lit up the sky.  No sound of impact or crowd craziness occurred. We all looked at one another and asked if we all saw the same thing.  There were no sounds when the object flashed. The object was grey metallic like naval ships.  Must of been 20'w x 40'h x 40'l approx. in size.  I saw com trail was more vapor-like than smoke; almost like moisture or steam. It disappeared quick in 10 seconds. The flash was amazing.  Haven't seen colors of blue like that in lightning. The object had structure but not like an airplane falling downward.  It was more squared with a noticeable corner extending off to one side.  The travel distance downward was five times that of the height of the Hotel next to the Harbor. I know people may have sen it who were near the street but who looks directly upward that fast.  Three seconds from trail to flash and 5-10 seconds of vapor trail evaporating.  Cars below would have missed it since it was directly above.  Cars in traffic must have seen it flash. I think our position at the harbor was the best vantage point to see the object falling vertically.  It was hard not to notice something that big on a vertical fall. My initial response was a falling star burning up, but the grey shape of the object didn't fit in my mind as a non-burning falling star.  So I googled this site to write it all down and let it go.

The light grew brighter as the sky darkened and eventually started pulsating to every color inthe rainbow every  2 seconds then turning dark yellow with this red stuff seemingly dripping from the bottom.Then it began to fade and abruptly disappeared at 7:48pm. That was nothing compared to what happened tonight. The light promptly appeared at 6:30 pm slightly higher than where it was last night.As the sun  went down the light began to grow very bright with these pointed rays coming out of it looking like a star that goes on top of a christmas tree.  This light was lighting up the night sky.  The light began moving west toward ala  Moana then disappearing far out to sea off Barber's Point a! t again 7:48 pm.I am absolutely sure the same phenomena wil occur again tomorrow at 6:30 pm ending at precisely 6:30 pm ending at 7:48 pm.Watch the sky-It WILL happen tomorrow.",

I left my house at about 10:00 a.m., on my way to pick up a friend. Recently there have been (more than usual) very loud military aircraft flying overhead, and I heard one.  I stopped on the walkway to see what kind of plane it was, and saw a jet, a military F-15 or something (small 1 or 2 man plane), flying loudly from right to left.  It had probably just taken off from Hickam AFB.  It flew out of sight, and I looked at the sky to see if there were any more, though I didn\u2019t hear any. Then I saw something kind of sparkling and thought it was another one, only this time much higher in the sky. I watched it and could see that there were two seemingly identical but separate objects, flying together in exact and tight formation, both bright shiny silvery and thin triangular/arrowhead shaped, and flying very fast and very high in tight, eccentric circular movements. I first thought they might be two birds flying together, but they were so high up and so large that they would have had to be giant pterodactyls or some other mythical giant silver birds. No, they were definitely not birds. I watched them for about two minutes and they could not have been military jets, as no aircraft I had ever seen or heard of could perform such maneuvers at those heights and speeds. I kind of waved my hands in front of my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things and was sure that I wasn't hallucinating or delusional. I  was, however, a bit startled. I had not been drinking or taking drugs. I went back into the house, as I had forgotten to take an item with me. When I returned to the walkway, they were gone or out of sight. I am currently retired after working the past 26 years as a medical transcriptionist. I had never previously seen a UFO.",

I have two floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom that I keep the curtains pulled backto enjoy the city-scape lights a night.

With the Spring winds blowing from the Northeast, oddly it was completly still about 100 - 200 ft higher than I am on the 30th floor. It was located just South of Punchbowl crater, out over the city.  After I noticed it wasn't moving in the winds, I began to study its shape from the reflected light of the city streets below......then a light appeared in the cloud, like you see when an airplane is letting down thru clouds at night with the landing light on.  First the light was fuzzy inside the cloud then, the light became a bright peachy-orange color... like it broke out of the cloud... I was trying to adjust my eyes to make sure it really wasn't a plane\u2026  The light became! clear and brighter, in a full circle/ball shape, about center of the cloud. It was a stable light, not flickering like a burning flare appears.  Then the round light went back into the cloud with about half the round shape visible/hanging out of bottom of the cloud, bright on the bottom and diffused in the cloud.  Suddenly the light just went out.  From the lights of the city, the little cloud was still visible with a black, perfectly round hole in it.  The little cloud didn't just drift off, it quickly faded away without moving.... odd, considering the strong, gusty wind that night.

That altitude and distance makes it difficult to approximate a size, but my guess is about 5ft in diameter and 30ft long.  The wind was very strong that day at about 15-20 knts, from the Northeast.  At first I thought it was a balloon on its side, but it was not bouncing vertically in the gusty wind.  It was quiet.  It was moving smoothly due West, against a quartering headwind that was gusty and strong.  With the West sun shining directly on it, it reminded me of a white hotwater heater flying horizontally, on its longside, with the end of it pointing toward the beach. It continued till it came about even with Diamond Head crater, in the distance.  It appeared to stop, against the strong winds.  Then, it moved toward Diamondhead without turning.  It moved Northward with the narrow end of the cylinder leading the way.  It stopped close to Diamondhead for less than a minute, then continued West, flying broadside again.  Finally, Diamond head blocked my view of it. The flight path normally used was clear of airliners that day.  Due to the strong Northerly winds, the airliners were much farther South, landing to the North.",

This morning I woke up about an hour before sunrise, to see what appeared to be something similar to lightning without thunder.  Looking Southwest from Waikiki, at about 19.5 degrees above the horizon, in hazy clouds, an extremely bright light would flash, and light up everything as if a full Moon were out.  This was briefly preceded by some dimmer, flickering that lightened the entire black sky to blue. Honolulu International Airport began service and the first airliner took off Southward along the shoreline then headed East as the lights continued their routine.  The next jet took off following the same flight path, but stopped short just before arriving to the cloud with the light, then circled back to the airport.  Then another jet took off, went to the cloud, and circled back to land, as well.  The lights continued, and finally three more planes took off, one of them a commercial airliner, the other two smaller, propeller planes, all headed on the same path East as the first plane.  The lights continued until the morning sky just turned from black to blue.",

The camera used is a Sony NEX6 16mp with a 50mm lens that has a crop factor of 1.5X.  Thus the lens is really 75mm. I shot the picture with an apeture of f8. Below are highlights of my observation:   1.  A previous shot taken at 17:05:50 does not have the object; neither does a shot right after at 17:06:01...so it appears the object covered almost 3/4 through the view in 4 seconds or less and disappeared from the view in 7 seconds or less. 2.  The object in sight seems to be much larger than the boat shown in the picture to bottom left of the rainbow. 3.  I did not hear any loud jet/helicopter sound, noise nor see it while taking pictures. I only noticed afterward while reviewing the pictures that night (last night). 4.  I took the shots on the ridge above the famous Hanauma Bay, Oahu Hawaii. The area on Google Map is Portlock Hawaii. 5.  Distance from where I took the shot to the rainbow my guess is perhaps around 2-4 miles away. Pictures to follow...

Thursday, November 21st, 2013 Sandy Beach, Oahu, Hawaii   Sometime between 11am and noon local time, my son and I were walking along Sandy Beach watching the bodysurfers when my son yelled, \u201cWhoa, did you see that?\u201d  I did not see anything while we were on the beach but my son, who is 13, was quite impressed with what he witnessed.  Below is his story in his own words:  \u201cWe were watching the bodysurfers surfing the waves.  I was standing near this big rock right by the ocean, looking out over the horizon when I saw an orb that was bright white, almost like a florescent light bulb but sphere shaped.  The orb was about as big as a grapefruit.  It had come from thin air, going very fast but slowed to a halted hover in a very small space.   As soon as it slowed, it dropped an orb that looked the same as the other one but just bigger, like a soccer ball.  The bigger orb dropped in the water and made a small splash.  The small orb hovering in the air flew off and disappeared in a flash, literally.   I looked down at the water where the orb had fallen but there was nothing there even though I saw a little splash.   I looked in the sky again to see if there were more orbs.  I scanned the horizon and saw more of these occurrences but they were further away.  The first sighting was very fast, probably two and a half to three seconds long.  The other sightings lasted longer because the orbs traveled further than my first sighting.   Then, after the last orb (the fifth or sixth one) dropped its load of a larger orb, the orbs all vanished. \u201c",

It happened while I was on duty and preparing to do my last patrol of the shift before ending. At approximately 0025hrs(12:25am), I observed a blue and red light flying over the Ko'olau Mountains near Tantalus/roundtop drive.  My first thought was that it was a plane coming over the mountain, but I quickly ruled that out when it changed course, moving slightly to my left.  It was much to sudden to be a plane, so the next thing I thought was a helicopter, which was quickly ruled out soon after when I observed the lights make a sudden change and begun to fly in a zig zagging kind of path in the sky, and not to mention that there was no sound of helicopter blades chopping through the air at all. Upon that sudden course of action it conducted I was most certainly interested now.  I continued to monitor the lights and even repositioned myself on the property to try to get a better view and continue to observe it's strange and erratic movements.  It then proceeded to appear to descend towards the ground where I could no longer observe as my vision was obstructed by trees and structures.  It's movements were like someone pointing a laser pointer and moving it all over the place except much more controlled and not as fast, but faster and able to do things that a plane or helicopter could do. Shortly there after it's descent out of my view, my Supervisor shows up at my site to check up on me as usual during my shift, and almost soon after he arrived the thing shot back into the air and proceeded to fly erratically as before, I quickly pointed it out and even he was baffled by it and we both continued to watch it until it descended again to the ground where we couldn't see.  My Supervisor is a former U.S. Marine and he said he had never seen any aircraft do things like that, not even a remote controlled device. I know what I was thinking when we watched it, but I waited to hear him say it first. \"I think we just observed an Unidentified Flying Object\".  We ruled out cars that might have been on the road on the mountain as we both saw the object fly high enough that we could see there was space between the outline of the mountain and the lights, so it was definitely in the air. We saw it shoot straight up suddenly and we thought it was gonna zip away, but it hovered for about 5 seconds before shooting back down towards the ground where we couldn't see it.  And that was the last we saw it. Immediately after my shift at 0100hrs I got in my car and drove up to the Military Cemetary at Punch bowl to try to get a better view. Once up there I saw a group of 4 young people hanging out overlooking the area where my workplace is and so I asked them if they saw it, if they saw the lights. One of them, a girl, admitted to seeing a red light shoot up from the corner of her eye not long before I arrived.  And that was the last time I saw it, I waited for about 15 minutes more to see if it would return, but it didn't.",

As in straight out!   We watched the other two wait patiently, just hanging there in front of us.  Then suddenly, the third one reappeared from the right and slowly meandered back to his companions. This display went on for some time. My father was a Yale graduate and a first mate on a vessel in WW2.  I asked him what he thought and a man who knew everything refused to commit on this. The discs were tri colored with lights along the rim.  I believe they were orange blue and yellow or red.  I remember thinking the colors were rather unattractive and clashed a bit. I was about 11 or thirteen.  Very young but I do remember thinking they were so close we could count the lights. I'm afraid I cant tell you an approximation of how big but they weren't small. Hawaii is a huge military outpost.  I think the Honolulu Advertiser had a small blurb the next day about venus reflecting swamp gas. etc..

      "story": "Moving yellow-orange orb seen by myself for about 20 seconds before passing behind cloud, have tech background to r/o normal objects On 7-29-15 at approximately 2020, I was returning to my apartment on the 16th floor walkway of our high rise condo building and noted that the sky was partly cloudy with cumulus clouds, the almost full moon was out, and a few stars visible.  I then noted in my peripheral vision another bright object in the northern sky, at about 70 degrees elevation.  Initially, I assumed it was Jupiter, being yellow-white in color and bright, but this object\u2019s magnitude (brightness) was actually somewhere between Jupiter and Venus when I looked directly at it.  Then I realized that Jupiter/Venus had been in conjunction in the western sky lately and could not be the object.  I am also familiar with the appearance of stars, other planets, and the time of year they are visible. This was different, in that the object appeared as a steady orb and to my surprise was moving downward in a northerly linear/ballistic direction with relation to the building overhang.  There might have been some slight wobble side to side, but being familiar with auto- kinesis, I could not rule this out as the cause.   I looked to see if the object had any lesser peripheral lighting such as aircraft position/navigation or anti-collision lights, but none were apparent.  I thought it strange if this was a landing light of an airplane that it is usually not totally and consistently visible at that angle when moving away (plus it tends to waiver due to aircraft movement and atmospherics).  I could not tell the exact altitude of the object, but it seemed as high as an aircraft might traverse or maybe even higher.  It was visible while moving for perhaps 20 seconds before disappearing behind a cloud and not re-emerging on either side.  Frankly, for lack of a better description, it! reminded of the scenes from the movie \u201cClose Encounters of a Third Kind\u201d, which depict the spacecraft crisscrossing the sky at altitude, albeit in this case at a little slower speed.  A friend suggested that it might have been a commercially available drone flown by an individual, but it seems unlikely as it was at least at about 2-3 thousand feet in altitude in order to pass behind the prevailing cumulus clouds (which were forming about 1-2 thousand feet at the time), and they would have probably lost track and control of it.  Additionally, the lighting was not pinpoint, diode, or laser like. Strangely, no noise was noted, which would usually be heard from an aircraft/airliner, as the back side of the building is normally quiet. Furthermore, the closely adjacent low mountain ridge (only a couple of hundred feet away) and our building form sort of a bowl for collecting sound.  Surface winds were light and would not have distracted much from any sound. I also thought maybe it could be a weather balloon being illuminated at high altitude where the sun was still striking it, since it was only 2020 and the sun sets later in summer, so I cannot totally rule this out.  I do not know what the prevailing high altitude winds were at the time.  However, I do recall when I previously observed such balloons and even satellites in the past, that they tend to oscillate in brightness due to the changing sun reflection off the envelope or shifting hard surfaces. This is the first time I have experienced something like this in all my 58 years and believe that if others in the east Oahu area of Hawaii Kai (City & County of Honolulu) were looking in the same direction at the same time, they would have easily seen it.  I am contemplating contacting the Honolulu Star Advertiser local newspaper on this matter to see if any others reported this.  I now have a greater appreciation for those who say they didn\u2019t have time to take a photo or get other witnesses, as I was just outside my apartment and briefly contemplated rushing to get my wife and son to come out, but now realize that if I had done so, it would not have been in time and I would have missed part of the event. With respect to my background, I have a past that includes aviation (private pilot single engine land & sea rating, licensed FAA aircraft mechanic with ratings for airframe & powerplant, former FAA air traffic controller Tower trainee, including National Weather Service observer training, did some aviation accident investigation for worldwide aircraft insurers through AirClaims in Hawaii & Alaska, and have a bachelor\u2019s degree in Aviation Administration from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University-which included coursework in flight physiology).  I have also been an avid amateur astronomer since childhood, having built and owned various telescopes and taken several formal college level courses in the subject (including astrophotography). I most recently worked the last 23 years as an acute inpatient psychiatric RN at a major hospital in Honolulu after getting my nursing degree.  I also completed some graduate level education in nursing. Given the aforementioned, I believe that I am somewhat familiar with aerial and astronomy phenomena and have been able to be clinically objective in my appraisal of anything I have seen, but this episode was unusual and unexplained.

Then one of the lights left the others and flew close to my bathroom window that is located towards the back of the lanai behind the washer and dryer.   When the light came close to the bathroom window, which was also closed it illuminated the bathroom with a reddish -orange light.  It then floated back to join the other lights that were still floating in the air.  They remained there for awhile, about 15-20 minutes.  Then they just disappeared.   I was frozen sitting in my bed. I was frightened by it and didn't get a friendly feeling from these lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

It caught my eye whereupon I noticed way above it an extremely bright jet shaped object (no wings or tail fins and brilliant white) streaming across the sky.  The tail had an inverted thruster as compared to an extended or protruding one such as many jet fighters enjoy.  It had an extreme altitude (higher than civil flights), was about the size of a battle ship, no sound whatsoever, and crossed the entire clear sky in less than 4 seconds.  Before I could call attention to it...... it disappeared into the sunrise.  I couldn't believe the speed of this object!  No missle on earth could possibly approach this speed.
