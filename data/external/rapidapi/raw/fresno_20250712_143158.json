I suddenly saw a glowing light come from behind the tree (no bigger than the north star) in a straight line heading west and then it stopped gave two flashes of light simultaneously and all of a sudden shot straight in the air at such a speed it was unbelieveable and as it went higher it gave one last flash and completely went black.

My boyfriend and I were driving home to San Bernardino from Ashland, OR when he woke me up to look at something. He woke me up and pointed out these two lights that were flashing in the sky. To him, he thought it was a plane that was flying so low it was going to crash. We watched these lights for a minute, and a third one lit up and the thing flipped over, and was doing all these crazy flips. Then, it flew over the freeway towards I5North and it went into this field and looked like it had landed, but you could still see the lights. Suddenly they came back up, hovering, and started spinning like a top. It flipped over and came back over the freeway to I5South, and by this time it was behind us. My boyfriend told me to get his digital video camera out, and as I was looking for it, the thing turned on it's side and flared up its lights and looked as if it was coming after his car. I decided to forget about the camera and just told him to drive.  I'm not saying anything about aliens or other life forms - there could have been a very logical explanation for what we saw....but as of right now, I don't know what that is. So I can only define it as an unidentified flying object,which is exactly what it was.",

I had watched this light for approx 4 hours the first night. It looked like a star but through binoculars it was clearly pulsating blue and red lights with a white light in the center. It did not appear to move but though it looked as though it was very far away it shown very brightly. On this fourth night I shared the binoculars with several people who tried to come up with some explanation. We had just about concluded that as the internet suggested, it must be the refraction of light between us and a planet causing red and blue flashing appearance when the light within seconds moved to the horizon low to the earth but still probably hundreds or thousands of miles away. No planet or star would move in this manner and no aircraft could have covered the distance so quickly. Now I am really wondering what this is and if it will return!",

      "story": "An apparent star in the night sky which exhibited anomalous behavior I had this experience as an 11 or 12 year old child, but I have always remembered it precisely.  I have long thought that I should submit a record of this to someone who would add it to the data on this topic, and I am finally doing it. Let me preface by saying that through the years, I have observed several objects that people who were with me at the time thought were UFO\u2019s, but I knew they weren\u2019t because I knew what they were.  One was a weather balloon, one a jetliner near the airport (when they have their landing light on at sunset, it is a striking sight), one a meteor close enough to hear the roar and light up the night sky and one a military missile in an inexplicable location.  However, the one sighting I can\u2019t explain was the least visually striking.  I say all this to demonstrate that I have a decent amount of knowledge in explaining explainable sightings. One soft summer night which I believe was 1963, but may possibly have been 1962, my father, my three sisters and I went out on the patio to watch the Perseid meteor shower.  It was sometime in August.  We had a rollaway bed out there, and we all lay down on it sideways and side by side with each other.  We scanned the sky for shooting stars, which appeared at the rate of about one per minute. One of my sisters said, \u201clook, two stars are colliding!\u201d  We all looked where she indicated, and indeed, you could see two stars moving toward each other.  As we watched, they did, in fact, meet and merge into one, only to separate again after a few seconds.  After that, everyone else went back to looking for shooting stars, but I kept observing this phenomenon.  After a couple of minutes, I realized that only one of the two stars was in motion.  It kept moving on its steady path, and I kept watching. My first thought was that it was a satellite.  Some months earlier, forewarned by a news broadcast, we had gone out to watch one of the early manmade satellites pass overhead.  It looked just like a moving star.  I suppose it reflected light from the sun, which enabled us to see it.  It had a steady progression across the sky and kept a fairly steady level of brightness.  After ten minutes or so, I realized it couldn\u2019t be an orbiting satellite.  I noticed its apparent path across the sky was noticeably slowing.  I kept watching, and the next thing I noticed was that it was dimming.  I kept watching for perhaps half an hour, and it gradually slowed until it was essentially motionless in the sky, and it gradually dimmed until finally, it slowly became impossible to make out.  At first sight, it had the appearance of a medium to medium bright star. It was clearly not a satellite or a meteor.  The only scenario I\u2019ve ever been able to think of that matches my observation is that of a space ship in the process of leaving Earth\u2019s orbit.  In 1963, we had no space ships which left Earth\u2019s orbit.  What I saw was truly an unexplained flying object. I would be glad to answer any questions concerning this.

      "story": "4 unknown flying crafts were following our car and another one hovered over our neighborhood when we got home. My husband and I for the last 2 1/2 months have been seeing strange hovering objects in the sky beginning Nov. 3rd 2008. The last sighting was last night around 6:45 pm. We were driving west on McKinley ave in Fresno CA on our way to a meeting. We noticed 4 hovering objects at a stand still on each side of our car about 3 miles up in the sky when we were at a red light. Once our car started moving they moved along side us, every time we stopped they stopped. They all looked alike and did not look like helicopters and not planes. Later on in the evening on the way back home we spotted another craft similar to the ones earlier just hovering at a stand still above the houses in our neighborhood. the object even brightened its lights from red to super bright white. it was still for about 3 minutes then slowly started to move to the right, then left then it either vanished or we just did not catch it take off. This is not the first time we have seen these objects in the sky. we seen larger ones the size of two commercial planes before. We just find it strange that the sightings have not stopped. Our children, my parents friends and my mother in law have all witnessed them. For some strange reason these objects have not gone away and seem to be growing by the numbers each day and showing themselves pretty boldly. If anyone has seen them also please post a report, we hope we are not just going crazy over here by ourselves.",

WHILE DRIVING FROM CALIFORNIA, SOMEWHERE NEAR FRESNO, TO TEXAS, LATE NIGHT, AROUND 11 PM OR SO, ON THE FREEWAY, I NOTICED WHAT I THOUGHT TO BE AN AIRPLANE TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT WAS QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY, AND COMMENTED TO MY MOM, \"OH LOOK, AN AIRPLANE, AT WHICH MY MOM STATED \"OH YEAH\". NOT THINKING ANYTHING ELSE OF IT I GLANCED AWAY, BUT THEN GLANCED RIGHT BACK AT THE OBJECT AS I REALIZED THAT IT WAS FAST APPROACHING, AND HEADED OUR WAY. I KEPT MY EYE ON THE OBJECT AND SOONER THAN I COULD IMAGINE, IT WAS RIGHT UPON US, ONLY I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION RIGHT AWAY THAT THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY THIS COULD BE AN AIRCRAFT OF OUR WORLD! REASON: THE AIRCRAFT CAME WITHIN A FEW INCHES(12-18) OF HITTING MY VEHICLE ON THE RIGHT FRONT HOOD, SUDDENLY STOPPED AND STAYED THERE FOR A BRIEF FEW SECONDS, THEN BOLTED UP TO THE RIGHT AND LINGERED THRE. IT STARTLED MYSELF AND MY MOM, TO THE POINT THAT I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THIS AIRCRAFT WAS GOING TO HIT MY VEHICLE, THAT I HIT MY BRAK! ES AND MY MOM HAD A LOOK OF SHOCK ON HER FACE. MY SISTER, MY DAUGHTER AGED 9 AND NEPHEW AGED 11 WERE IN THE BACK SEATS ASLEEP AND WERE AWOKEN WHEN THE VEHICLE JOLTED, DUE TO THE APPLICATION OF THE BREAKS.MY SISTERS TWIN DAUGHTERS, ALSO IN THE BACK SEATS,REMAINED ASLEEP. I YELLED TO THEM TO LOOK AT THE AIRCRAFT, AND WE WERE ALL AMAZED. IT WAS HOVERING, BUT STATIONARY, AND DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHTS, LIKE STROBE LIGHTS, WERE BLINKING FROM THE AIRCRAFT. AS SOON AS MY SISTER SAW THIS, SHE REACHED FOR HER CAMCORDER, BUT AS YOU CAN GUESS, THE BATTERY WAS DEAD! BY THIS TIME WE NOTICED THAT OTHER VEHICLES WERE DRIVING SLOWLY AND HAD THEIR ATTENTION ON THE AREA WHERE THE AIRCRAFT WAS HOVERING. I NEVER FULLY STOPPED MY VEHICLE, BUT WAS DRIVING SLOW, AND WE WERE ALL WATCHING IN AMAZEMENT. NOT KNOWING WHETHER I SHOULD OR NOT, WE DECIDED THAT I SHOULD CONTACT THE POLICE. I EXPLAINED TO THE OPERATOR WHAT WE HAD SEEN, BUT WAS UNABLE TO TELL HER EXACTLY WHERE THIS TOOK PLACE, AS WE WERE UNAW! ARE OF THE AREA. STILL IN AMAZEMENT, ALL IN THE VEHICLE WERE S! TILL IN SHOCK AS TO WHAT WE HAD JUST SEEN, AND I EXPLAINED TO THOSE IN THE CAR WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THEY WERE STARTLED AWAKE BY ME APPLYING MY BREAKS, THEN MY SISTER ENCOURAGED ME TO TURN AROUND AND SEE IF THE UFO WAS STILL THERE, WHICH I DID, BUT IT WAS GONE, SO WE KNEW IT WAS NOT JUST OUR IMAGINATION. IT WAS REAL. WE SAW A UFO! IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN AIRPLANE, JET, HELICOPTER, OR WHATEVER ELSE, IT STOPPED DEAD CENTER, MOVED UP AND RIGHT, AND HOVERED.

Now when I say lights, I don't mean like car or plane or copter lights. They looked like a glow from a fire or if a trash can was turned upside down and a huge road flare was put inside of it. I didn't see anything else to describe, no hull, nothing else. It was very cloudy that night due to an earlier rain, the clouds were low, and it moved right in them. It also moved very slow.  As it moved further away from me, the back      light trailed back and the front left light trailed to the left. And that is the last I seen of it. It was also big, hard to tell exactly, best guess, about 60 to 75 feet. It was some what close, about 100 to 150 yards in front of me, and about 3 light poles up, I am not great at guessing feet when it comes to altitude. There was no sound that I could hear. Juan, my partner said he seen some of the hull, and saw the lights crossing. I will try to get him to fill a report out.",

There were no other stars around it. It looked so weird, I didn't take my eyes off it. Then I see 4 lights flash off the side, in a straight line. I was amazed. I looked around to tell my friend. He came over and looked up. The look on his face went to confused, to scared. He walked inside saying it's too much for him. I didn't move at all. I wanted to see exactly what it would do. 5 minutes passed. The lights continued to flash. Then, it started to spin. I started walking a little closer, but then at the corner of my eye i see another light. I look closely at it. Then a craft came out of nowhere and slowly hovered almost above me. Almost as if they were watching me. Then it got to the end of our fence. This craft was floating above the house, it caused our lights to flicker. As soon as it got above our house, it went blurry and just disapeared above our house. It vanish! ed, it didnt move it just disapeared. My friend comes outside and he sits down on the chair. He was talking to his girlfriend acting as if nothing happened. He didn't see what I just saw. I turn to him and start walking toward him. All I said was Joey, then passed out on his porch. I woke up in his room in the chair. Every night since that night I hear things above my house. Around one to four. One night i actually saw lights flash through my window. I never sleep anymore. Im terrified of what i saw. Its been 2 months. I continue to hear hovering every night. I thought it was my fridge, but when i unplugged it and went upstairs, it got louder. I didn't want to see what i saw. And I know how most people want to see one so bad, but believe me, you don't want to encounter one. I never sleep, knowing I'm being watched and in fear that something might come in. I wish I never saw it. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It was about 9pm. We noticed a light in the sky. It was a very clear calm night; it looked like a ball of fire like a hot coal. The closer it got to us it looked more like a football or possibly saucer shaped thing, which was hot white/yellow in the center and got orangish gold toward the outside. This thing flew from a distance away toward us and above and beyond us across the sky. Approximately 500ft up?  It was totally silent. The size to our vision would be similar to if you held a children\u2019s \u201cnerf\u201d football out at arms length. Being at the height that I assume it was, it was very big. Bigger than my moms house easily. I have seen the EXACT SAME style craft on a ufo show. the one where craft hits the desert then bounces back up then hits again and explodes into a million firey lights, its pretty popular i think. Here is the weird part, we had my moms camera up there to use like a scope (kids ya know) it was an old 80\u2019s rectangular style one. Anyway with camera in hand I saw all this. Never once thought to take a picture at all. It was too strange for me to do anything but stare at this thing. It didn\u2019t move super fast either. 100mph? Now that im almost 33 im a better judge of visual speed applied to something at a distance and 100mph for an air craft isn\u2019t that much I think. We had our parents look through the news papers to see if a meteor had hit or other people reported seeing it. it was really big. There was nothing. Ok, years later, when I spoke to my friend about this again, he said something I didn\u2019t remember and still barely remember. Within 5 min of the sighting, he said 3-5 military style helicopters flew across in the same direction. This could have been at the point that I jumped off the roof and frantically tried to explain to my mom what had just happened. Since those days, I have become a huge ufo enthusiast as well as other unexplained things. All stemming from personal experiences like this one.  I will post more sightings I have had over the years right after this one too because the form wouldn\u2019t let me use \u201cvarious\u201d under times and dates.

The orb went south to northeast and was only visible for more than 15 seconds before it vanished very abruptly.  As I alerted the other individuals that it could be a possible UFO, they all dismissed the orb and didn\u2019t mention it all day.

On my patio, I first noticed how light is it outside and quite abnormal for this time of night. I glanced up and noticed many lights above the clouds moving fast in wide circles. At first I thought it might be a spotlight on the ground but soon realized there were too many of the lights to be one spotlight circling. They move fast and in a very wide circle but not a perfect circle and the heavy clouds would prevent me seeing any beams of light but only the lights themselves. No objects outside the beams of light were present. ((name and telephone number deleted))",

      "story": "My first sighting of a UFO On the night of December 6, 2011, as I am traveling North of Chestnut Ave. coming from Alluvial in Fresno, CA heading to Sonic to buy food for my son, I seen an unidentified aircraft coming at me.  It was around 8:30ish.  There were hardly any stars in the sky, it was dark.  There were no cars in front of me or behind me, but cars coming from my opposite direction.  As I was driving up North towards Nees Ave on Chestnut, I saw a light coming somewhat straight at me.  At first, the thought came to my mind that it is an airplane crashing down, I felt somewhat scared.  I did not want to witness anything extreme at that moment.  The flying object as it descended from the sky, started slowing down and got bigger.  As it was getting bigger and getting close to me (feelings: very scared), I began praying for it to stop or just be close enough that I could see it, but not close to me as to like being in front of me.  I really did not want to get abducted, that was the next thought in my mind.  The UFO aircraft stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  As I was staring at it, my thoughts were \u201cAm I really seeing this?\u201d the feelings of being shocked was trembling in my body.  My eyes were stuck at this unidentified aircraft, trying to figure out what this thing could look like, but all I seen was 3 circular lights, somewhat close together, shaped like a triangle, the lights looked as if it was spinning at a rapid rate, from red and blue, with traces of yellow light as it was glittering and spinning at a rapid rate.  The bottom of the craft looked like it had some rigid form structure around the lights. The UFO aircraft did not look large; it seemed somewhat medium/small size.  That was all that I seen from that... After a couple of seconds, maybe 15-20 seconds, it gradually started to move, to the right of my view, and curved up towards the sky.  It was lighting speed, it made traces of white light (like a tail of a star falling from the ! sky, except it was going up) as it ascended to the heavens.  I! never s een anything like it, or have I seen an aircraft as fast as that UFO craft traveled.  I\u2019m still in shocked.  Today is December 8, 2011, 10:31AM.  I\u2019m trying to recall my story of my first encounter of the flying object.",

People have been lighting off illegal firworks and we were watching the show.   As we were looking up, I saw a large triangle craft moving slowly to the south-west towords the airport.  I was standing facing the same direction, when my son spoted another set of lights that looked like bright orbs.  There was 3 of them and moving south-east of our home.   The large triangeled changed colors form white to red to blue then back to white, then started to fly way faster than anything else that was in the shy that night and was out of sight in about 4 seconds.  The orbs also changed color.  Red,white and then back to red.  We could see other airplanes flying into the Fresno airport and taking off, but nothing could fly without making a sound.   We waited to see if the Air National Guard would send jets to the area of these objects, but nothing. We have seen other unexplained lights over the greater Fresno/Clovis area for the last couple of months, but nothing like this.  The orbs stayed on the same course, but came together as one light and disapeared straight up.

While traveling north bound on Interstate 5, approximately 30 miles SE of Fresno, a linear object with three bright lights (Two on the end and one in the middle) approached our truck, containing six passengers.  When we first saw it, the linear object was around 500 yards away.   Five of the passengers, including me, saw the formation of lights continuing to fly towards our truck. During this time, the object rotated similar to a plane that has stalled.  We were confused and somewhat scared as to what this object is.  It headed straight towards our truck where it flew about 10-20 feet above us.  It was close enough to where the driver, and the two front passengers, one of which was me, ducked and screamed.   While continuing to drive, we watched behind us as the three bright lights lifted up and dove into the ground and then back up again.  The bright lights spun and rotated until it finally disappeared.   The object was about 30 feet long.   Keep in mind that it wasnt until afterwards we realized that it made absulutely no sound when it passed over our truck.   And the compass on our truck didnt work after the sighting.

One of the boys sighted a swarm of about ten (10) fuzzy white orbs zig-zagging through and about the clouds in the overcast sky just east of the intersection of Highway 41 and Avenue 12 north of Fresno, CA.  They watched these &quot;fuzzy&quot; white lights for about five-minutes as they turned west onto Avenue 12 toward Madera, CA.  As they drive west, the boys encouraged the mother to turn the car around, which she did, to return to the intersection.  The mother then turned north onto Highway 41 while  they all watch the lights swarm around through the clouds.  Just east of the same intersection is a barn and many ongoing acres of open farmland/ranchland.  According to the boys, some of these fuzzy white lights had a small star-like center to them.  Additionally, on the ground, to the viewing-right (e.g., south) of the reference barn (as see! n from the intersection of Highway 41 and Avenue 12) there was also seen a large triangle-shape (tip of triangle pointing upwards).  This object had blinking white lights at each tip of the large triangle.  The mother turned the vehicle around, from north to south, on Hwy 41 and drove home.  They do not have any explanation as to what they saw in the distance that night.  There is a creek that runs north to south near this area.",

It was almost straight up in the early morning sky (2:30 AM) a bit to the South sky, I saw a fast moving line four lights (about equal to the stars that were out) traveling from West to the East, from one side of the sky to the other ending in their disappearing behind the tree line.  They were spaced far apart but clearly together.  The line was side by side not in a follow the leader row, the line was perfectly straight, each light was constant, not blinking and without color of any kind, the speed was difficult to tell now knowing the distance but it was very fast and took about 4 seconds to go all across the sky.  There was sound at all. This is the first time I have seen such an event, I feel lucky to have seen it, but at a loss to identify it as something earthly.

As usual, I went out with them to look at the stars.  I was just getting ready to go back inside when I heard a louder than usual jet engine.  I looked up to see two military fighters flying in a north to south direction at a high rate of speed.  They appeared to be at about 10 to 12 thousand feet (estimated).  I am not sure how fast they were going. Certainly not above mach I, but close, maybe.  They were in a slight climb as they passed almost directly overhead.  All of their navigational lights and strobes were on.  Just in front of the fighters (approximately one quarter of a mile), I saw a single, pale, greenish/white, spherical light that was about the size of a ballpoint pen tip.  It was pulling away, slightly, from the jets.  A few seconds later, the object executed a slight climbing right turn to the southwest, and accelerated, increasing the distance from the fighters as they turned to follow it. At that point, the object disappeared (winked out).  The jets continued to the southwest until I could no longer see them.  The whole sighting lasted no more than twenty seconds from the time I first saw the jets until the object winked out.  It is unusual to see any aircraft flying north to south at the altitude I observed, because of the proximity to Fresno Air Terminal, and the traffic patterns.  Though, at 11:30 pm, there is almost no air traffic at all.  Also, the Air National Guard is based at FAT, and they tend to keep noise levels at a minimum over the city.

After they passed overhead we then ran to the front yard to continue watching them.  They were still bright orange at this time and still no jet sounds.  We watched them for another 30 seconds before one went to a dimmer orange and then a few seconds later the second one dimmed.

So I finally got up just to get him to stop bothering me, when I stepped out side i was instantly enamored It was a big blue light that moved effortlessly high in the sky almost like a bird, it flew for a little bit in a direction but would effortlessly turn back around to were it started.  It was beautiful and mysterious.  Too big and too bright to be a toy or something controlled by someone below,  It moved like an aircraft but much more elegantly and effortlessly.  Best way to explain it.  I don't really believe in Aliens but whatever it was, I have never seen anything quite like it.   After awhile it seemed like it was falling downwards like an air! plane out of control and then it dissipated.

      "story": "Slow moving pillar of orbs floating horizontally and passed by 4 people. Saturday night 4 of us were hanging out on our roof in the downtown area.  my friend spotted something in the sky and pointed it out.  It looked like a pillar of luminescent smoke from a distance.  As it got closer and I could see it better it looked almost like a chain of 4-6 plastic bags with a candle inside.  (Our brains were trying to comprehend what we were seeing more than remembering exactly what it looked like.  Unfortunately no one thought to grab a camera until it had gotten too far away)  It moved slowly and horizontally and we could actually see energy lines that it was riding on.  They stayed in line but would bobble back and forth sometimes.  The edges and body of the orb seemed to be made out of plasma or something and I observed a soft yellow glow while others saw more red.  It passed within about 20 feet of us just a dozen feet above the roof.  Since then I've talked to 2 friends who also saw this from the tower district.  My research has led me to believe they were inter-dimensional balls of plasma which had leaked through from another dimension and fully materialized in our own.  Many of us are into meditation and healing, this thing left us with a very wonderful feeling and has changed all of our lives for the better.  Another friend was also below us in her room playing bass, we wonder if that had something to do with it.",

On Saturday February 1, 2014, at 3:43 pm north Fresno, CA, I saw what at first I thought was a large black bird coming from the west toward me and my wife, but as I looked it did not have flapping wings.  It did change shape somewhat, not much.   I went into my garage and retrieved my 50X binoculars to get a better look.  What I saw was a black object that seemed to be a jumble of mix of cubes and other shapes mostly black but not completely.  It looked as if it was mottled with black and no color.  The object was tumbling with the sun reflecting and this was why it appeared to be changing shape.  I came to the conclusion that it must be a bunch of balloons as the tumbling seemed to be effortless.   As I was breathing heavy from yard work it was hard to get a very stable look with the binocular.  I looked around to find something stable my shaking.  Not finding anything I looked up without the binoculars and could not find it.  I asked my wife where it was as she was watching it only with her eyes.  She said it just disappeared, was there and then gone.   The object was traveling west to east at about 25 mph and was about 500 feet above us.  The weather was clear and no wind at all.  The object appeared to have a flat path not going up or down.  It\u2019s hard to say what size it was but I would guess it was 20 feet across.  It was not a uniform shape.  Also no sound.",

At first, I thought maybe it was a plane but as it moved closer, I thought it might be some sort of meteor.  As it came closer I realized it wasn't anything that I've ever seen before.  It moved laterally through the sky at a fast pace at about a helicopter's height in the sky and then it hovered over my house, stopped, went back a bit, went forward a bit, then went up higher and higher and got darker and darker.  Then the light went out but I could still see something there, way up in the sky.   The larger darker object stayed stagnant for about 20 seconds, moved forward slowly at first and then it went toward the northwest at a much faster pace than before and traveled across the sky till I couldn't see it anymore because of the distance.   This thing was pretty huge for me to see it clearly fly across the sky with no illumination.  To me it looked black and long, maybe cylinder or rectangle-shaped but hard to tell since it was so dark in the sky.   My stupid phone is so cheap I couldn't get any good shots of it.  I have two pictures but they are very small and I need a usb cord to retrieve them.   I realized later that the fireball was flying in virtually the same path the military jets take when they fly over our house.  I'm in NW Fresno, CA, and they usually come from the east and fly northwest.   The sky was nice and bright and clear with an almost full moon.  It was really big, whatever it was.  It had no trail, it was silent, and appeared to be lower than an airplane until it stopped and went higher.  It definitely wasn't any kind of weather balloon or anything I've ever seen before.

And I saw it. It was a bright blue-violet light, flamelike- like a flare. I watched carefully to try to figure out if it were a place or manmade craft by its signal lights but there were none.  It was just one big blue-violet light. It would slowly change color from blue to violet and back.  And it was falling towards the horizon and slowly out of sight before the houses in the distance.  But as it fell it would suddenly stop and start climbing again, and fall again, with each attept it would rise less until it fell out of sight. All of us were stunned, I knew it wasnt a plane.  What got to me was how it felt, from my perspective like an organic life form stuggling to stay afloat.  Like as if it were slowly passing out or giving up.  For when it rose it did so with almost a pull of spirit until it gave up again.  I have been searching online to see if anyone else could have seen it but I guess it was only us.",

The main object still traveling finally stopped in the SE sky.   After about 30 minutes the main object started to travel back to my area traveling now NW coming low once again I then saw a small plane traveling N, it seem when the object came close to the plane it retracted back to the SE sky.  I then tried to call my local airport but no answer, I then called a local news room while I was speaking to the woman I saw other objects flying high in the eastern sky giving off bursts of light or flashes the woman thought I was nuts and hung up.   I then called Lemoore air base they told me to call my local 911 so I did so they in turn connected me to the fresno airport tower and after telling them what I was viewing and the location of the object in the SE sky changing color he then said hold on as he looked for it he told his co-workers what the report was and he said to them \"I'm dead serious\"  He the picked up the phone and said that he could see it as well he then told me to call 877 787 7444 Bigelow arrow space  ((sic.  Aerospace)) I said okay and hung up I then called the number but it was a bunk line.   There is something going on in the eastern sky of fresno and it must be looked into ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

They appeared to be heading from West to North towards my direction at first, but then the objects started moving southward.   The glowing objects were scattered from each other, but they were all moving in the same direction in a synchronized motion.  I would guess the approximate altitude of the objects ranged from 3000 to 5000 feet in elevation.   The glowing objects started to disappear from the sky one after another even though they were at a distance that should\u2019ve been observable if it were a plane.   I got out of my vehicle to try and record them, but my phone camera couldn\u2019t really capture the glowing objects due to the poor lighting conditions outside.   There were no blinking signals (such as those seen on aircrafts), and I didn\u2019t hear any type of aircraft sound.  The objects were dead silent, and hovering and a constant speed which seemed to be moving much slower than typical airplanes.  I pulled up to some police officers at a stop-light 10-15 minutes after the event, asked them if anyone had called in about \u201cweird lights in the sky\u201d and they said no.   Approximate duration of sighting was 4-5 minutes.   This is the first time I have ever witnessed anything like this.

The noise was a loud hum; like if you were close to some kind of giant electrical machine or generator of some sort. When I got outside the humming was all around.  I couldn\u2019t tell which direction it was coming from.  I walked to the front of my house but didn\u2019t see anything.  So I walked to the side of the house and from the corner of my eye I started seeing something what appeared to come out of nowhere. I believe I was looking in the direction of what would be the side of it.  At first it looked like a radio tower up in the air and horizontal.  I could not see the object until it was just going past me which revealed the rear of it.  As the object was passing by the \u201crear\u201d was coming into view and what looked like little red lights at first turned out to be large rectangular red lights. My best guess with the dimensions is it was 200-300 feet wide x 20-30 feet tall but could not tell how deep it was.  It wasn\u2019t until it stated passing me when I could really see it. There were 4 rectangular lights a least 20 feet high by 50 feet wide. It looked like there may have been other lights that were not on or were dimmed but the 4 bright red lights were in the middle.  The red did not look like fire or rocket blast but like GIANT screens showing just red in perfect rectangles.  Not fire engine red but I guess fire red without the fire. The whole experience lasted about 5 minutes.  No mention of it on the news and I cannot find similar events online.",

      "story": "Stealthy object in night storm  clouds The evening of 20 Oct. at approximately  20:10 (0010Z) there were possible storms moving into my area. Lightening was reported to the West North West over Delaware, Ohio.  I observed  cloud reflected lightening in that direction, as well as to the South.  Cloud deck was reported as 3,000 to 6,000 feet at 97%.   While feeding horses and looking to the West, I observed at about 280 degrees azimuth and 25 degrees altitude,  a small dull red spot,  which appeared unmoving.  It grew somewhat brighter for about 3 seconds, but still remained dull red, the color that  heated steel  just becoming red might appear. At this time, it began moving  very rapidly across the shy towards the East South East,  heading approximately 100 degrees. It disappeared  at approximately 170 degrees azimuth and 85 degrees altitude, the whole episode lasting about 7 seconds from first seeing it until loosing sight of it. There was no sound associated with it\u2019s passing. When this object (yes, I am going to call it an object) was almost overhead,  I had the impression  it had a rounded  shape, possibly  oval or u- shaped, and that the dull red portion was the leading part of some airframe, glowing from air resistance heating. It\u2019s body was totally black with no lights, appearing against the clouds as an empty spot with a dull red part. My  analysis of this event is that when I first observed it, the unchanging bearing means it was coming essentially directly at me. As it got to a lower altitude, it\u2019s linear motion became apparent, and the fact that it traversed  70 degrees of sky in 4 seconds means to me that it was  below 5,000 feet altitude and hence subsonic, disappearing into a cloud bank.. That fits with the cloud deck height. No sound means it was gliding or silently propelled. The whole thing had the feeling of a re-entry event. Re-entry into a thunder storm seems a good way to cover the sonic booms, and thick clouds providing visual cover. So, either  someone has a really advanced  stealth aircraft, or we are not alone.",

Trying to remember because it was a couple years ago Christmas time. early in the morning between 2-3 am. While I was working graveyard as security for a retirement place in Fresno, CA. I was sitting in my vehicle with the window open and stopped under a freeway lamp to do my report and I looked up on a clear night to see this HUGE silent black craft right above me.  I am not sure of the shape it started forming a misty cloud around it possibly vapors or condensation cloud which started to block it from my vision. I remember it had HUGE LED type of lights, more than one they were so bright they kinda had a blue color to them.  The craft was motionless and silent. I remember it being the same night as a very similar craft was seen in Colorado.  This, however, was located directly above the freeway at Temperence Ave exit and the 180 freeway, going towards the airport where NORAD is located in Fresno, CA. Within a couple of minutes after it slowly moved towards the airport, a helicopter flew over where I had seen it. I do know that the freeways here are blocked by local law enforcement whenever they have secretive flights from an unknown agency. My guess is NORAD.  It had to be governmental not alien operated. We are so advanced in technology. Me...I'm retired Law Enforcement. What a sight!  And, I wouldn't have known it was there if I hadn't just looked up.

We then saw at different times two triangular shaped formations with 3 lights. In the distance at one time we saw 3 lights in a straight line, which later disappeared.  As the clouds moved, we would see the Y shaped lights again and again.  They were hardly moving.

It looked as if this blue ball was going to fall on the warehouse, but when it got about 30 feet off the ground, the blue ball turned red. and it started flying off at an angle away from the warehouse and away from the freeway.   I was approximately 200 feet away from the blue ball at that time.  The blue ball turned instantly red.  It flew off at an angle towards the east.  I was 200 feet away I know it wasn't a helicopter I know it wasn't an airplane it appeared to be about the size of a basketball.  Intense blue that change too intense red I'd like for someone to tell me what the heck that was.  Does that sound like something the military has?   I would estimated I first saw it falling at probably 20,000 feet.  It looked to be approximately the same height as a jetliner that was flying at about the same altitude but many miles away from the blue ball.  I'm sure the blue ball had nothing to do with the airplane.   There was only one other truck on the road going the opposite direction.  I don't think anyone else saw it I slowed my truck down to a crawl, but the other truck Kip gone.

At first I thought they might have been airplanes but I could not make out any wings.  They were very high in the sky so I thought maybe that might be why I could not see any.  The light I saw from them appeared to be reflection of the sun from something metallic. Most were not blinking but rather shown steady as a reflection.  However, there were a few in the center of the cluster that had a red glow that increased and decreased in intensity.   They were not in any formation.  They were scattered in an elongated bunch, some apart, some were close together.   After a minute or so I decided to try and count them. I got to ten but started to lose the front ones flying into the southwest.  I estimate that there were maybe 18 to 25.   They looked like stars.  Some brighter than others, but flying as a group.",

      "story": "20 to 30 black objects hoering in sky October 8, 2015, At approximately 10:05 AM my husband and myself were driving west on Hwy 180 and between Fowler Ave and Clovis Ave I noticed, I thought a flock of birds in the right hand sky above the tree line.  I said \"look at that flock of birds or maybe it's ducks.\"   My husband responded \"that can't be birds, they're too big for birds.\"  The formation was kind of round to the left and gradually & sparsely dwindling to the right, kind of like the tail.  The formation was made up of black shapes, some large, some larger and some smaller.  Their shapes were bigger on one rounded end than the other rounded end and the sides were straight lines.  Some of these shapes were moving and the smaller ones in the tail section were fading. So, right before Clovis Ave, the winery storage tanks cut off their view until you're almost under the overpass.  At that point the sky opened up again and the shapes converged into a larger mass (left) that still had the shapes, but they now were much darker and they were NOT moving, but kind of hovering in the air (the tail, for lack of a better word, had disappeared).  It is hard to describe in words, but easier to describe verbally.  I think it was kind of hard to look at, meaning hard to describe something that made \"no sense!\"   They disappeared again because of the freeway embankment, but my husband said we'll catch them at Hwy 41 where the road climbs and the embankment disappears.  Well, needless to say, the mysterious \"thing\" in the sky had disappeared!",

      "story": "Mass sighting of 30 to 40 black objects over Fresno, CA. Thursday October 8, 2015.  At 10:05 am, my wife and I were traveling on Freeway 180, between Fowler and Clovis Avenues, about a mile south of Fresno-Yosemite airport in rural Fresno, CA.   In the clear sky about what we thought to be  a mile or two west of the airport, out of our front window we saw about thirty to forty black objects maybe more stretching across the sky. We viewed them for about ten seconds until our line of sight was blocked by huge winery tanks off the freeway.  As an estimate this fragmented formation could have been up to a mile in length moving across the sky in a slow hovering motion.  The largest body of the grouping was closest to us and narrowing down in size as it distanced away.   My first impression was a mass parachute dropping near the airport?  A few seconds later driving past the tanks the sky opened,  and again we saw them but now they were clumped together in a tighter formation.   After again losing sight as the freeway dropped behind the trees I rushed ahead for about a minute, to where the freeway was above the trees giving us a full view of the north west  sky.  To our amazement there was nothing, only helicopter circling above and a black SUV off the freeway with the two occupants looking up with one pointing to the western sky.  I assure you these were no parachutes or birds, but something I have never witnessed before.   If my judgment of distance was correct they had to be at least the size of a small airplane.  If they were actually farther away they were then much larger.  This formation was not like one you would normally see displayed by an air force flight but that of a semi-scattered group in closer proximity to each other but yet looking fragmented and not necessarily pointed in exactly the same direction.   Trying to determine their shape and size was a bit confusing as they first appeared to be more square on the left end and sloping down on the right.  Like a fat eyebrow to even perhaps a delta look, but their shapes, though seeming somewhat uniform, were not.  Trying to get my mind to focus on them was strange to say the least, as if they were trying to change bits of their shapes as I watched.   I called the airport tower spokesman asking if they had seen anything as such and he said he wasn\u2019t on duty this morning and there was no report.  The Tower spokesman then gave me the number to the UFO center and encouraged me to call.   I am a 1967-69 Army veteran and retired fire captain and have never before witnessed such a sight.   Incredible \u2026",

While riding as a passenger in a car in a residential area of the Tower District of Fresno, CA, I saw a strange light in the sky and asked the driver to pull over for us to get a better look at it. It was dusk, verging on night, so we got a good view of twenty or more luminous objects meandering across the sky from north to south, as if in a disorganized squadron.  The light from the objects was similar in effect to a candle or firefly; there was no sound at all. We watched this display for about 5 to 7 minutes, until each UFO was out of sight.",

My partner was driving, and I was in the passanger seat.  When we were on 1-5, heading north, about 60 miles south of the exit for highway 152, we saw a strange aircraft to our left.   In this area, there were orchards to each side of I-5 with nothing else in sight, and it was pitch black except for the lights of other cars, and the lights of this aircraft. When we first spotted it, it was north west of us, flying south.  It seemed quite far away.  We watched it for a few minutes, and it looked like two bright white lights.  When it was just about parallel with our car, it turned towards I-5, and started flying directly toward our car.   Once turned, we saw three lights that got bigger as they got closer.  It took about a minute or two to reach I-5. At that point it was close enough to see that it was very low, flying just feet above the trees in the orchard. It flew across the freeway, just feet above, and in front of, our car.   Once it got to the other side of I-5, it flew about 20 yards into the orchard to our right, and turned again.  It flew north along side our car for about 30 seconds before it turned again, flying back over I-5, this time just above and behind our car.  At this time we lost sight of it.",

      "story": "02/04/2016, Fresno, CA, Doughnut, 4-5 min, hovered, then landed super quick in front of vehicle, huge round craft, brown/gold, vanished Mr. X Documentary File # 00701  THE CRAFT This is to document the factual events that occurred on or about 02Apr16, at or about 1:40am, in Southern California in the city of Fresno.  The occurrence was witnessed by, and is conveyed by sworn testimony equivalent to, and with all judicial authority, as stated under oath by the signed witness, Mr. X.  There are several items preceding File #00701, including and limited to; one drawing of Object ABC articulated by Mr. X in the presence of a close kin.  After explanation to kin about Object ABC, Mr. X was asked by kin if he could draw, or recite details of Object ABC.  Mr. X did articulate the main features of Object ABC on an old small paper bag.  That image was then destroyed.  There is a second document articulated by Mr. X detailing the occurrence encountering Object ABC. As Mr. X was exiting the freeway into Fresno, California, using GPS from his phone as he navigated to his destination.  The GPS on the phone he was using began giving false readings, and performing out of its normal functional character.  Mr. X attempted to adjust the GPS as he drove on the off-ramp from Freeway 99 into Modesto, CA.  About 50 to 100 feet from completing the exit ramp, Mr. X saw a strange thing seemingly hovering off to the left of the exit over-pass.  As he began to focus on the object, the object seemed to flip, or slip, or shape-shift, landing in the middle of the road, on top of the over pass, directly in front of Mr. X\u2019s vehicle.  He stopped the vehicle before running into the object. Mr. X stopped the vehicle, and tried to comprehend the sight of the huge craft, and make sense of what he was seeing.  He tried to wake his children, and co-passenger.  One 16-year old son sitting in the front passenger seat, one 14-year old son sitting in the rear passenger seat on the left side, and one female 18-year old female passenger sitting behind the driver\u2019s seat.  All passengers were asleep at the time of the sighting.  Mr. X tried to wake everyone up, and even shook his son sitting next to him.  Mr. X began to speak aloud thinking that someone may be awake and listening, \u201cwhat is it?  Look at this you guys.  What do I do?  I don\u2019t understand.  What am I supposed to do?\u201d  He asked.  When no one responded, he tried once again to wake his son, then decided to do something he thought might be stupid.  He thought that he couldn\u2019t leave this moment without being absolutely sure that what he was seeing was real, and with no obstruction between his own eyes and the stran! ge object.  (He didn\u2019t want to wonder in the future, because he knew he was seeing something that he never had seen before.)  He stepped out the vehicle with one leg, and stared at the huge object, with one hand on the door as he stood straight up.  He looked at the object for about what seemed to be 7 to 11 seconds, only looking into the vehicle for a split second at his passengers, and asking if they could wake up, then looking back at the object.  Just then a vehicle horn honked and when he looked back, he noticed there were two vehicles stopped behind him, and a third pulled off to the right.  The Third car was the vehicle that was honking.  At first, Mr. X thought that they were honking at him to get back in his vehicle before the strange craft did something to hurt him. (like he was crazy for standing out in front of the craft like that, so close.) Mr. X looked again at the craft as he got back into his vehicle, and as he clasped his seat belt, the huge craft just vanished in the plume of faint smoke or gasses, which quickly dissipated.  The Thing that Mr. X is calling smoke, or gassed, can a! lso be called a mist, and even visible fumes, or a cloud of something.  This action of the gasses had a visual effect something akin to a visible fume, without a smell, and was all around the craft. Mr. X then began to proceed the remaining 15 yards, or less on the off-ramp to the light.  He continued to look for the object, and look at his GPS to find his way.  The GPS still did not give correct magnetic north, flipping and changing routes sporadically.  He drove from memory, until calling his friend that he was going to visit, and having the friend guide him to his friend\u2019s home. Mr. X pulled into his friend\u2019s driveway in about 8 minutes after that.  As soon as Mr. X passengers began to awake, he began talking about the Strange Craft.  The first thing he said to his friend after saying a brief \u201cHi.\u201d Was \u201cI just saw an Alien Space Craft\u201d.  The friend just thought he was joking, but he wasn\u2019t joking at all, and as Mr. X began to walk, he lost control of his legs, and became weak.  The friend had to hold Mr. X up and assist him in regaining balance.  The passengers, Mr. X, and the friend all entered the home, and went out back to sit in a rest area of the home for a moment. The Craft was huge, Brownish-Gold, with tints of Green, Red, and Lots of Black.  The texture was Hexed, or X / cross hatched, with some kind of braces running vertical along either side curving with the surface of the craft from top to bottom.  The braces were of the same color, and were about three and a half lanes apart, on either side from the center where I was.  The craft was about 50 to 60 feet high, and obscured at the top and sides with the strange black cloud, or fumes.  At the bottom of the craft, about a foot and a half off the ground was pitch black, where the outline of the craft could be seen as it hovered close to the road.  The craft did block the view of anything behind it, and the street under it.  The craft made no sound, and had no smell.  Just an eerie silence.  Mr. X did get out of the vehicle, and look at the craft with his own eyes, and he did have glasses on so he could see the craft very clearly. The craft did appear from hovering off to the left of the freeway, and did move very quickly (impossibly quick), and stopped on a dead stop in the center of the roadway.  The craft did vanish, with the gas or smoke leaving a few seconds after the craft vanished.  The roadway became clear and lit, and the yellow center, and white lane lines became visible all the way across the overpass, where Mr. X was to drive. This is the sworn testimony, and statement of Mr. X, who is identified yet requests to remain anonymous for as long as possible.  The events described within this report are true and accurate to the best of my recollection, and in in no way fabricated, or made-up.  I swear to what I saw, and I am MR. X.  I have no understanding for what I saw, and I know that the nature, and actions of this strange craft was not of anything that I have seen on Earth. I hope this report helps, as I was asked to document the events of the evening on which I saw this Strange Unidentified Craft.  Signed:  Mr. X",

I was camping by myself at Trimmer campground on Pine Flat Lake in the Sierra Nevadas.  I woke up at 1 A.M after falling asleep in my car to warm up.  When I woke up I looked down at the lake and saw a very bright white light shining bright sitting right on top of the water on the edge closest to me.  I reached for my phone which showed it was at 6% and I brought it up to take a video and it died immediately.  I didn't want to scare it away by starting the car to charge my phone, so I watched without taking my eyes off of the object for about an hour.  It was very bright, white when I first saw it and over some time it dimmed down at times going underwater and moving around.  When it went underwater I could still see the light smaller and less bright underwater moving.  Eventually, I thought it had disappeared and I had to get out to use the restroom.   As I opened the door, I kept my eyes on the lake.  It reappeared very bright, right when I opened the door. Then it! dimmed and shot under water and further away.  I used the restroom got back in the car and continued to watch the seemingly intelligent orb or unidentified object reacting to the noise I had made.  On the right side of the lake, there were two blinking lights signaling boaters to avoid something floating in the water.  The unidentified light lined up next to the flashing lights and started flashing, as though mimicking the flashing lights.  It then traveled mostly underwater, at times peaking up further away until I could not see it anymore.",

      "story": "large dark craft, chevron-shaped, no lights, no sound, no windows, geometrically sharp edges. Large chevron shaped craft, no lights and completely silent   I was outside on my balcony at around 6:40PM on a cold evening in December looking at objects in the sky through my telescope.  There was a moon above and wispy clouds, and the night was exceptionally clear.  I was late for a dinner date, but I wanted to get as much observing as I could before I left, so I was just about to go inside and I stood up and walked backwards to my balcony door, still looking at the clear night and stars.  My balcony door was propped open to my living room and the lights were dim, I was at the door threshold when I saw a distinct shape, like a chevron, or delta-winged shape, it looked like a hang-glider.  I said to myself, \u201ccool, a hang-glider\u201d, and I went inside.  I stopped and said to myself, \u201cwhy is there a hang-glider flying? Where did he jump from?\u201d it is flat in Fresno until the foothills about 11 miles away. I went back on the balcony and the craft was right in the middle of the square of Pegasus constellation and the wingspan was almost as wide ! as the diagonal stars across the square. I estimate that the craft was about 800 to 1200 feet in altitude, completely silent, no lights and was moving at a slow pace. It looked as though it was moving back and forth, or left and right as if it were scanning the area, it was low enough to see that there were no windows, the color of it looked as though it was changing from black, charcoal grey and the color shapes were not clear and seemed to be matte, no reflections of any sort. I tried to make out an insignia, a logo, an American military branch, an identifiable anything, there was nothing. The craft seemed to have an underbelly of some sort, like a rounded belly with no other shapes or cutouts that looked like landing gear. The edges of the craft were geometrical and sharp, like a wedge cut around at 45 degrees, it moved right over my head and from west to east towards the foothills and slightly north. The craft flew over me and it was in my view for approximately 30 seco! nds to a minute. I kept repeating to myself, \u201cwhat the F*** is! that? w hat the f**k is that? What the f*** is that?!\u201d, over and over again. I knew that my camera was just inside and it had been charging all night and I wanted to grab it, but I didn\u2019t want to blink and I wanted to \u2018see\u2019 this thing as long as I could. I grabbed a notepad and pen that I use when observing and immediately started to draw what I was seeing. There were two people outside, one walking their dog and another throwing trash, but I didn\u2019t alert them, I just noticed that they had no idea that a large craft was flying just over head. I estimate that the wingspan was about the size of a football field in width at the height that it was flying. It seemed to glide in the air, perfectly and parallel to the ground and never tilted so much as a degree, it flew in a straight line at a slow steady pace. Slower than an airplane would fly and faster than a hang-glider would, but it seemed to float or glide through the air. High enough to push little wispy clouds out of its path, if the moon was not out, I don\u2019t think I would have been able to see the craft as it reflected hardly any light and seemed to absorb light. It flew over a baseball field about a half mile away and the high-voltage lights were on and I could then see that the craft\u2019s underbelly was lower than I thought and that the craft\u2019s shape was just a thin line. I then ran to retrieve my camera and I thought to myself, \u201cI bet this thing won\u2019t work\u201d, like every UFO reenactment that I have seen on television. I turned it on, and the camera was dead in th! e water, no lights, no sounds, no nothing, dead battery. So I continued to observe it as it disappeared in the horizon. I was shocked by my reaction of seeing an unidentified craft, my first and very up-close and personal, I was excited, but at the same time, I was in total fear of what I was witnessing. It brought tears to my eyes that something this ubiquitous could fly directly over Fresno, at rush hour during Christmas season and shopping, fairly low and whomever is piloting this craft, was so blatant and not worried if anyone could see that this craft was something like no other. To me the craft looked as though it was unpiloted, maybe remotely piloted like a drone, it seemed to be scanning the area and moved in such a way that seemed to be autonomous or artificially controlled with GPS or machine logic. After it was gone and out of sight, I was frightened and shocked, concerned and worried that it could be ours, or one of theirs, perhaps an invasion, or reconnaissance before the military strike. I held back tears, and I thought of turning the camera on again to see if it worked, I flipp! ed the \u2018on\u2019 switch and the camera lit up ready to shoot, that is when I started to cry realizing that there are things in this world that are kept from us, and I believed in all the conspiracies and every UFO sighting. I was enraged and sad that we are kept from knowing this technology, what else is out there that we don\u2019t know that could possibly harm us? Whatever this thing was, it was magnificent and huge, black, silent, had no lights and stealthy enough to fly over Fresno, CA in the bustle of Christmas season and only one person, myself actually saw it flying overhead. I am hoping that this craft was one of our own military\u2019s and that it is online to protect our urban areas from threats from any enemies. I have the drawings that I made and detailed maps of its trajectory. As a crow flies, it was headed directly towards Area 51 in Nevada, which is very close to Fresno, CA if you look on a map, any crafts that fly out of there, would fly right over Fresno to get to the ocean to do any maneuvers, over Fresno is the shortest route. I hesitated writing this report because I thought I was delusional, but after seeing all of the reports of a similar craft in this area, I thought I would add my event sighting to the database so that everyone can read and maybe someone else thinks they are seeing things, but I saw what I saw, and I can\u2019t explain what it was.",

It was roughly 3-4 times larger than any star in the night sky and was much bigger than any other plane in the area, even at a distance.   I kept my gaze on the light until I noticed the light start to dim and fade.  It was bright, yet not blindingly, until it slowly faded into complete darkness.  I lost track of it after that.   Less than 10 seconds after it disappears, I noticed what appears to be military or authority planes all over the area around where the light had traveled, and they continued to do so for 20+ minutes.

I was walking at Woodward park in Fresno, California, on the road, I would be on the South East end of the park parallel to Friant road. coming from the west were a set of lights that did not look like an aircraft, it caught my attention, its path was headed straight over my location as it got closer I realized that it was making absolutely no noise, there was no sound what so ever. There were three to four lights on or near the front of it that projected forward off its rectangular shape, they were slightly Amber in color, as it went over head the underside reminded me of what a car would look like if it was up in the air and I was looking up at it.  There were a few more lights sparatically positioned in the underside and there was clearly white vapor or&nbsp; propulsion trails, aproximitly 4 or 5 shooting behind it but they weren&apos;t very large. It was flat and rectangular with definitions of design underneath but in size it&nbs! p; appeard to be about the size of a large commercial buildings foundation. It was moving at a steady spread and was not racing towards earth and did not apear to be something burning up in earth atmosphere, as it passed over head I noticed the brightest White light facing backwards from the rear of it, it looked like a giant cone shaped flood light and it was pure white. It crossed Friant road and headed towards Clovis and the hills and appeared to me to be loosing altitude the lights in the front seemed to redden as it got further away from me and it was definitely arching downward a little. I thought it might be heading towards the ground i wasn&apos;t sure, this did not look like space debre nor any man made aircraft. My view of it lasted aproximitly 20-30 seconds.

      "story": "A short accounting of this even written for a memoirs class. UFO Sightings The sky was black\u2014one of those moonless nights with crisp air and unending visibility.  If memory serves me it was early in the winter of 1974. I had just concluded a late-evening insurance appointment on Grantland Avenue west of highway 99 in Fresno, CA. Between 9:30 and 10:00 o\u2019clock, I headed for my home in Rolling Hills on the Madera County side of the San Joaquin River.  The most direct route from Grantland Avenue was to take Herndon Avenue east to Blackstone and then north on Highway 41 to Avenue 10. A mile or so west of the Sierra Sky Park I noticed what looked like an airplane, roughly 500 feet above the ground preparing to land at the tiny airstrip.  Small planes landing here were not uncommon so I paid little attention to it.  But I did notice that its rate of descent was considerably slower than an airplane.  Maybe it\u2019s traveling toward me, I reasoned.  The closer I got to the airport the more attention I paid to the object\u2019s flight pattern. After seeing how slowly it was moving I ruled out the possibility of it being an airplane, and thought it was a glider.  The only other logical possibilities were a hot-air balloon or a helicopter. When I clearly saw its oblong shape I ruled out these possibilities too. Curious, I pulled off the road onto the soft shoulder, came to a stop, and turned my engine off. I got out of the car and listened carefully for any audible sound. Nothing. Not a whir, not a click, not a sound! The windowless gray object wasn\u2019t hovering. Instead it slowly drifted in a northwesterly direction across Herndon Avenue toward the airstrip about a hundred feet above my head, still continuing its descent. I felt sure it would land but instead it drifted west and began following Herndon Avenue back toward highway 99. I got back in my car, turned around, and followed its white light. As I picked up speed it picked up speed. The faster I accelerated the faster it went. Then in the blink of an eye it pulled away from me, its intense white taillight receding into the black starry night. What was that? I thought. The traffic on Herndon that night was non-existent. In 1974, Herndon Avenue was little more than a two-lane country road. I\u2019m calling the airport when I get home. Maybe they\u2019ll have some information. Someone surely saw that. Once home I called the Fresno Air Terminal control tower directly, which you could do in the early 70s. \u201cHas anything odd shown up on your radar screen the past thirty minutes?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo sir,\u201d the air traffic controller answered. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cHow could you have missed it?\u201d \u201cMissed what?\u201d After explaining my encounter he said, \u201cWell, for one thing it would depend on its altitude and location relative to our radar equipment,\u201d and then continued with some additional mumbo-jumbo about how radar works. As I slowly calmed down from my excitement I explained to him in detail what I had seen. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s really odd. Someone else called me from near the Sanger River bottom earlier tonight relating almost exactly what you\u2019ve described.\u201d And the following week I was northbound on highway 41 south of the San Joaquin River Bridge, when I noticed a bright-white light in the sky similar to the one I\u2019d seen earlier. I felt sure it was an airplane and continued observing it as I crossed the bridge. As soon as the object reached Avenue 10 it took a laser-like ninety-degree turn to the left and accelerated out of sight at an unbelievable speed. Many people have experienced sightings of UFOs. Many scientists and the military downplay their existence because nine out of ten sightings can be explained by other phenomena. Some people claim they were abducted, with a small percentage of these asserting that medical experiments and who knows what else were performed on them. Since that time I have listened to stories and accounts of UFOs with interest on one hand, and with reservation on the other. Most of these sightings involve objects shaped like discs or triangularpatterned groups of objects. Nearly all first-hand accounts have not described what I saw\u2014an oblong-shaped craft. With the advent of the Internet I have revisited the subject hoping to find photos or stories that more closely mirrored my experiences. My search uncovered only one sighting that described something similar to what I saw. This incident happened near Mansfield, Ohio, on October 18, 1973, and was widely recognized as one of the most notable UFO sightings that year. I was amazed to find how many similarities my encounters shared with this documented UFO sighting. Here are a few samples: \u201cCigar-shaped metallic object with dome, body lights, light beam, apparent lifting force\u2026\u201d \u201chovering relationship\u201d \u201cThe object appeared solid\u2026red light at the nose, a white light at the tail\u2026\u201d \u201cNo turbulence was felt and\u2026heard no sound\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026the object accelerated and moved off to the west, showing only the white \u201ctail\u201d light as it receded, and made a distinct 45 degree course change to the right, heading toward Lake Erie.\u201d \u201cOn the ground, the driver and passengers of a car saw two lights, one red and one green\u2026 At first they thought it was a small plane flying low\u2026heard no sound\u2026its unusual qualities caused the driver to pull over and stop.\u201d There is no doubt that what I saw was real. It was just out of my realm of understanding. I haven\u2019t witnessed another sighting since, but will continue to search the skies for unusual events ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

The object was stationary.  The temperature was mild with a nice breeze blowing.  I realized that it was probably not a man made object.  The elevation appeared as high a commercial jet in a regular high elevation flight.  If there was a good wind on the ground then there would be high wind at that altitude.  A balloon of any type could not stay that stationary and any tethering impossible.  After around fifteen minutes the object had slowly drifted towards the West.  I knew my sister had a good high resolution camera with a telescopic lens.  I gave her a call and she saw and photographed it.  The object this whole time was pretty much stationary with a little noticeable drift.  I got home and tried to photograph it with my wife's camera but was not too successful.  I got out my high powered binoculars and could see it fairly good.  The object appeared oval. Insi! de the oval were too round ovals.  In between the two interior ovals was dark dot.  Everything except the black dot was a milky translucent and appeared to be illuminated.
