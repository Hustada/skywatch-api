I called MCconnel AFB the guard I spoke to had seen it but had no idea what it was. I met someone at our local mall years later who also had seen it but had no information. I also called our local tv station and cosmosphere, very few people saw it and it didn't seem like a big deal to them. I emailed coast to coast but no response there either, For such a weird event with multiple witnesses there is very little documentation. Anyone in this area outside at that time had to see it.

The other entry has it dated 10/30/1996 however I was a young kid Trick-Or-Treating at the time and I'm nearly positive it was the night of Halloween 1996. As a large group of family were walking down the street trick-or-treating we spotted 3 stationary lights in the sky. The lights were seen through cloud cover so no actual object was seen, and I can't be sure if the lights belonged to one object or multiple objects. The 3 lights were flashing in sequence, however I can't remember in which direction. The other report states it was right to left, but I honestly can't remember that detail. The next day we heard on the news that many others had seen the lights and there was no explanation for them.",

The movement was dramatically faster than anything that I have seen in my military experience recently in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The object was changing direction in a short period of time and then shot straight up in the air and disapeared. My wife was freeked out when I told her.

Goddard and other towns west of the city this morning because of what Westar officials are calling \"a transmission event\" at the utility's substation in west Wichita.  \"We don't know for sure exactly what happened,\" Westar spokeswoman Erin La Row said Tuesday morning. Reports of multiple transformers blowing at Westar's substation at 226 N. Hoover may not be accurate, La Row said. \"It's been described as a 'transmission event,' \" she said, though she could not provide more details yet. Widespread power outages were reported west of Ridge Road in Wichita, as well as in Goddard, Garden Plain, Cheney and Pretty Prairie, she said.  The outages are affecting homes, businesses and schools, officials say. At least four schools in USD 259 lost electricity and went to backup generators, district spokeswoman Susan Arensman said: Peterson Elementary, 9710 W. Central; Wilbur Middle School, 340 N. Tyler; McCollom Elementary, 1201 Waddington; and Levy Special Education Center, 400 N. Woodchuck.  \"We might have more schools\" lose electricity as the morning progresses, Arensman said. \"This thing is obviously changing as we go.\"  \"Pretty much all\" of the traffic lights in northwest Wichita are not working as a result of the outage, a Sedgwick County dispatch supervisor reported. But traffic appears to be flowing smoothly despite the outages, Patrol West Bureau Sgt. Guy Schroeder said. Police have been sent to high-traffic intersections, he said, but no problems have been reported.",

      "story": "It was about 11:00 pm I was outside smoking a cigarette because I don\u2019t smoke inside. I was talking to my spouse and I looked up because I caught movement behind some rather large trees up in the sky. I do not think I would have been able to see it if the trees hadn\u2019t broken up the shape of the object. It was like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. In the movie Predator the predator creature uses some kind of stealth/cloaking technology to remain unseen, and this was very similar in the manner that it was very difficult to visually make out. I know it was not a plane because it was far to large for that, and there were very dim yet distinct lights that were just as difficult to make out on what appeared to be the outside edges of the object. The object was about the size of two football fields in width and one in length, and was shaped like a triangle. The object was rather difficult to discern, it was as though it was and was not there. The lights gave it a shape, but no distinct characteristics were evident. Because of the way it moved with the trees in my field of view in front of the object I was able to pinpoint its location and trajectory, after it passed over the trees I got a more distinct view in open clear sky. \t At first I thought it was a hallucination or something but when it reached the clear sky I got a good look at it and I knew it was there. Our planes move through the sky and against the pressure of the gases that make up our atmosphere, as a result  you can see some difficulty in how slow they move even though you know they are moving really freaking fast. This object appeared to move effortlessly, and smoothly-like there was no resistance- and I called out to my spouse- What the hell is that- and started running toward the street to get a better look at it due to it\u2019s movement it was going toward a blind spot to- my at that time current position. My spouse did not have an opportunity to see what I was describing because as I ran toward it, it disappeared from my field of vision- strangely enough before it entered the area that would have been the blind-spot in my field of vision.

Object appeared small to the naked eye but could make out depth in the object which leads me to believe the object was very large but very high in the sky, something similar to a battleship although did not observe any weapons.  The object remained in view for about 30 secs before we lost sight of it as we turned north.  When we stopped the object was not there anymore.",

These objects were high enough above the horizon that I could see them but not high in the sky from my vantage point which leads me to believe these objects were a good distance away from where I observed them.  If an aircraft were to drop a flare right above you it would seem high in the sky, but if you were 10-20 miles away the flares would seem low on the horizon because of the distance which is how I could describe it.  These lights to me didn't seem like flares because they did not appeare one after the other. When they appeared it was almost like a formation of fighters that lit there after burners all at the same time only from the distance between the lights and myself it would not be redish white but more like a star.  These objects remained in the sky for about 3 min and then all disappeared like they appeared.   When I got home I noticed three lights in the same formation as the first formation only these light were due south of town.  They remained in the sky for only a minute and then disapeared as suddenly as they appeared. I am into weather and aviation.  I live and was raised in the air capital of the world and we have both an airport and military airbase here in wichita.   Being that my eyes are always in the sky I know aircraft lights and these were not that.  Dont want to say that they werent aircraft but then again have never observed a formation of redish white lights as bright as a flare like that in my life.

Im sure the pilots could see and also the control tower.  There wer at least 10 objects in the sky at the end they seemed to look cigar shaped then they went in to the clouds.

After my wife and I got on the roof, we both saw a fireball streak across the sky, from the south heading what looked to be due north.  There where clouds also that night. It was traveling at a very high rate of speed.  The fireball was bright orangish and was directly to the west of us. We could see it as it passed in and out of the low clouds, reminded me of the flame coming off a missle. But, I didn't think it was.  A few minutes later we saw another one.  Same type direction and so forth.  The Fourth one though, came out of the south and flew directly over head at which point I could no longer see it for the clouds. I had gotten a real good view of it. It was just a fire football shaped traveling very rapidly.  Jets fly over all the time but it was going at a much faster rate.  And it seemed to be heading North by Northwest.  It didnt leave trail of any sort and it wasn't any sort of fireworks.  I am in my 40's. I honestly dont know what it could be.  I am submitting this upon the request, of the UFO REPORTING AGENCY asked that anyone who saw anything to send in your report.  All four fireballs were flying low. The one I saw directly above me was about less than a thousand feet in the air. I had been wondering what it was we saw.  But hadn't heard anything until today, about it.

I have a decent knowledge of astronomy and aerospace. (my family were engineers/ Navy/ chemists etc...  So I know the difference between the emission of light from stars and reflection of LEO satellites.   This light looked nothing like either.  It was radiating its own light source.  I studied  it for about 10 minutes and noticed it was oscillating slightly and making very small, rapid movements. Trying to keep an eye on the object and grab the camera from the desk right inside the door.  I took 3 pictures zoomed out all the way. cant make anything out except a small light dot.  The next 3 I took were zoomed in all the way.  I used a 4 year old Canon EasyShare 10Mp digital camera. It pulsed amber light a few times and shot off toward mulvane/Udal area.

I keep seeing something big, and bright hovering in the sky, and it's been driving me crazy not knowing what it is! Can you or someone please give me and I'm sure there's more people too, but get us an explanation or answers?  I don't know about other people, but I really would like to know what it is!  I have been seeing this object now for about 2 months now. I've noticed that it's usually there about the same time of the day.  I'm thinking that it's usually there about when the sun is setting or more around 8pm and is up there between 30 minutes to an hour. One night I had got my digital camera out to try to take picture's of it, but then right as I was about to take a picture my camera had died on me. I have took some other pictures, but for some reason I couldn't seem to get the flashing colored lights and it just looks like some bright light in the sky.  I was hoping that maybe I could see it a lot better and get some picture's. Then if it turned out to be something that I needed to report, like an alien space craft then I would. Or if it just happened to be something explainable like some type of air craft that was from here on earth, then I would just let it go and not really say anything.  Well right before my camera had died on me, I had saw some red, white, and blue, flashing lights on the object. The flashing lights looked like they were going back and fourth from side to side. I think that was the only color's that I have seen on it flashing.  The part that sucks though is that I didn't get a chance to see anything else. I had only got to see those flashing lights when my camera was zoomed in, but not from the naked eye. When you look at it normally all you can see is a bright light or lights.  I think that if you just kinda glance at it, it only looks like it's one big bright white light, but if you look at it a little longer or try harder to look at it, it looks more like several bright white lights. It's not until you use something else to try to look at it closer that you can tell it has other flashing colored lights.  Every time I see the object that is hovering in the sky it kinda looks like it is the same shape as a flying disk, but then again I can get a chance to see it very close to confirm it. I really hope that someone from this company will try to investigate these sitings that I've been seeing, and get us some answers! Thank you for your time.",

Me my brother and two cousins were outside in my aunts broken car.  We were just sitting and talking for about a hour.  We all decided to go inside when my brother who is actually five years older than me pointed to the sky and said \"Ya'll look, UFO's!!\".   It was a semi-cloudy night but what we saw traveling into the clouds (sort of speak) was what looked like a fleet of spherical UFO's.  This fleet of space craft flew in complete unison in some very odd pattern (kind of like the formation of Canadian geese, but having 90 degree formations of all sorts).  We thought that we were being invaded by aliens as they flew across the sky at a slow motion with out a sound.  The spherical objects had a amber glow at the bottom. We watched what seemed to be over a 150 craft fly across the sky for about 20 minutes.   I was young then but i know that there had to be many people of Wichita, , that saw this sight, without a doubt. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I went to the stool room of the bathroom and while there I looked out the window and saw an object that was not familiar to me.  It was an object that was about the size of our refuse container.  It was about four feet high and four feet wide.  It was black in color.  It was sitting on my neighbor\u2019s driveway in the sidewalk portion in the drive.  The direction from me to the object was north/northeast.  It had a white light on the side near the top \u2013 the size of it was one inch by five inches.  It pulsed every two seconds but did not go completely out during the low side of the light.  The object was about 80 -100 feet from my position.  The unusual thing about the object was there were no definitive edges.  The house, driveway, lawn and street looked as normal.  The black object looked as if it shimmered slightly.  It was black but not a dark solid black with lighter streaks going through it horizontally though they were faint.  The only other thing that was not normal was that my ne! ighbor had installed Christmas lights on the lawn next to the driveway.  The lights were not on at that time. I went back to the window two more times \u2013 the second time I went back to the bedroom then back to the window.  The third time I went into the bathroom and then back to the window.  This was a Saturday night and we had stayed home -- I did not have an alcoholic drink that night nor have I ever in my life used any kind of recreational drugs. The amount of time I observed the object was about five minutes.  After this I went back to bed and told my wife about it the next morning.  At that time it did not concern me but the next night I was a bit \u201cspooked\u201d by it though nothing else was sighted. The next afternoon my wife and I went across the street to my neighbor\u2019s driveway to see there were any kind of marks that might have been left on the concrete there was nothing  About thirty years ago I noticed a white light that followed me and didn\u2019t have any idea what it was.  This white light followed me for about sixty miles while driving in central Kansas.  This black object was so much closer and seemed so much more real.",

I would estimate the altitude at somewhere around 90,000 to 100,000 feet and possibly following interstate 40 over Oklahoma City, Okla.  I would estimate the speed to be around Mach 20.  It took approximately 120 seconds for the object to traverse from the west to the east. The object traversed across the sky faster than the space stations, which I have watched from 11,000 feet in the San Christie Mountains at Philmont Scout Ranch.  But a whole lot slower than a streaking meteorite, with no contrail visible.   It appeared to me as if the sun was reflecting off the bottom of an aircraft.  Although there were no white or red strobe lights that was visible.  I feel that this could have been the experimental aircraft, Falcon HTV-2.  I am not sure what it was, but it was fast.",

My fianc\u00e9 and I were sitting in the back yard facing West near Kellogg and Ridge Rd enjoying the evening and a fire I had lit in our fire pit.  We were layer back in zero gravity chairs watching the fire and looking up towards the sky.  I noticed what seemed to be a falling star and got her attention to look up at it.  As it moved from the North kind of in a South-West Direction it got brighter as a normal meteor would when it breaches the earths atmosphere.  It was moving at an incredible rate of speed as most meteors do.  Out of nowhere, the object did a complete 180 degree turn and started heading in a due North direction.  When I saw this I yelled at my fianc\u00e9 who was also watching it.  I was excited and started explaining that meteors don't just change direction.  I don't think she quite grasped how important and significant this was.  I continued to watch it and it bobbled in the sky (like a line on a heart monitor would blip downward) but still mainta! ined the same speed.  I lost it behind a tree and never regained sight of it again.  I work as a supervisor in the aircraft industry and have even worked on military aircraft.  This was not a plane.  I am not saying it is alien in origin, but nothing I have ever seen moves that fast and changes direction as quickly as this did.  If I had to venture a guess I would say it is possible it is some sort of military project not yet brought to light, but honestly I am dumb-founded by it.  I told my lifelong friends, and they just kind of snickered.  I am not the type of person who would make up stories.  I know what I saw.  Until last night I never really payed to much interest in these sorts of things, but I would love to find an answer as to what it was.  I will continue to watch the sky at night.

It almost right in front of me.  I catch about a 3 second good look at it and by the time I got to the bottom of webb.  It was so low was so low I couldn't see it anymore.  It looked like something out of star trek. It was like a double decker triangle something.  And very very very large.  Has to be the craziest thing I have ever seen.will never forget what it looked like. So!  I have a friend who works for Jabara airport and he said he would talk to the guys who watch the radar and see if they know maybe whst it was.  He got told ..don't ask...I'm like really.  I wish they would stop being so secretive about things were not blind.  If anyone can help answer what I seen Friday morning please reply to this.",

Around 11:45 AM I am contacted by friend who is over 900 nautical miles away to go look outside at the waxing moon.  I went to the back yard (north side of house) and found the moon and then saw it.  A bright white orb that was stationary, moving in progression with the moon. It appeared big enough to see clearly with 6 x 25 Bushnell binoculars and easy to see with the naked eye since I was standing in the shade of the two story house. The weather was not a factor and there was no clouds and the sky was bright blue. There was no sound or anything emitting from the object. I then proceeded to get my 50 X zoom digital camera out and took still photos from 12:08 through 12:40 PM. The photos are taken at normal focal length and then full zoom, with date/time stamps.  Also without any filtering (polarized or UV).  In fact it could not be seen with the filtering on the camera, only without.  There is no video.  The photos show in one frame two separate orbs of light separated by three widths of the moon, but not detectable with the naked eye. I also had time to set up my Meade refactor telescope and have a very detailed look at the orb.  It changed shape many times going from an elliptical to flat white shape with white light emitting from it. While I was getting the telescope setup my wife also observed it with the binoculars and later looking through the telescope as I took photos. There were no aircraft in the area at low or high altitude.  No contrails. Very similar to other sightings seen since 2009 in the daytime.",

All I saw was the silhouette of it against a darkening sunset sky. I saw no tail features or wings.  It was just a dark and smooth cigar-shaped craft.   To add to it, there were 3 Cessna chaser-planes tracking and following the craft which was moving very slow.  The Cessna planes which were behind it were flying very unusually low.   The unidentified craft was flying from the South going North as if following the railroad tracks where I noticed it.  The area of town I saw this, 55th St south between Broadway and Seneca, is not a usual commercial flight zone.  McConnell AFB is approximately 5-7 miles from the location I saw this.   When I got home just 5 minutes after I witnessed this, my girlfriend said \"The weirdest thing happened!  The whole house shook just right before you got home and the lights flickered.\"  That's when I told her what I saw and figured it happened at the same time I witnessed the craft.   We live less than a quarter mile as the crow flies from the railroad tracks cross 55th street where the craft was witnessed.",

I then continue to watch it for a few seconds and I see it drop in the sky and streak off at a 90 degree angle to the west then flash with a bright ball of white light out of sight!

      "story": "Baffling Green Orb In the Skies Of Wichita Kansas On Halloween night (31 OCT 16), at approximately 17:03, while trick or treating with my son, my wife, and myself witnessed a green object flying in the sky in the city of Wichita, Kansas.   Initially I thought this was a joke, a balloon, or drone, but the more I looked at it, I realized I was looking at an event I still cannot explain.  I am ex-military, aviation, meteorology, and astronomy are hobbies of mine.  I posses a science degree, and this was an exceptionally bizarre sighting.   Light appeared to be in the shape of an Asian paper lantern, but cropped at the top and bottom, was lime green and was internally lit.  Object was completely silent, and due to overcast, could not  have been more than 500 feet in altitude maximum.   Object was lit in a manner that I have never seen, it was not a LED, or filament bulb.  No light rays extended from the object.   Object did not deviate in altitude and flew very level, and crossed from South to North, where it became obscured by trees in my line of sight.   I asked my son who was in a slightly differing position, where it went, he said it continued in a straight line for a about another second, and curved upward at an accelerated rate of speed and disappeared in the cloud cover.   Again, I cannot explain what I saw, and can honestly state that this was not a drone, or weather related phenomena, and I have never seen a light source of this type.",

Then it stopped, and just hovered, so I thought maybe it was an airplane... but it didn't move closer, it just stayed right there on the horizon.  I wanted to watch it longer, but we had to move on.  I kept looking back to see if it had moved, but it was still there on the horizon.  Once we parked, I looked again, and it was gone.

It happened when I was around the age of 13.  I\u2019m not exactly sure how old I was.   Me my dad and my little brother had heard there was going to be a meteor shower on this particular night.  So we set are alarms for around 1:00 am in the morning because the people on the news had said that 1:00am was when we could see the most meteors.   At the time we lived in a semi-rural area.  We lived in a cul-de-sac of about 12 house down a straight street, and houses spread out around us.  Behind our house was a field and to the right of this field was a baseball field and beside the baseball field a school with a playground.  Of course at 1:00 am no one was around and we lived in an already quiet neighborhood during the day so at night it was eerily quiet.  We had a lot of big trees in our yard but the baseball field was completely open so we decided it would be the perfect place to gaze up at the night sky.  We took some blankets out to the baseball field and laid them down on the dewy grass.  We laid down and looked up at the sky.  The stars were out and the moon was bright.  It was a clear night.  We laid out for about 20 minutes and we saw a lot of what looked like shooting stars which were meteors, of course.  Then I noticed something high up in the sky.  It looked like nothing I had seen before.  It was in the shape of an L.  It was large compared to the stars around it.  It looked like it had windows or lights down the base of the L.  It was still too almost like it was hovering.   I immediately told my dad and brother to look at it.  It was obviously some kind of flying object.  They both brushed and laughed it off.  My dad couldn\u2019t tell me what it was.  He didn\u2019t know what it was.  So we just kind of ignored it.   About 20 more minutes went by and we decided to go inside.  I looked up at the sky again to check back in on the mysterious object a! nd it wa s gone.  I had not even noticed it had left.  My dad and brother still say it was nothing but I know it wasn\u2019t.   I have no explanation for the unexplained, but I do know that what we saw that night should not just be brushed off; it should be explored.

      "story": "Triangular object glides over car while driving outside of town. On January 3, 2019, at approximately 9:30pm, our 11 month old son was fussy, so I took him out for a car ride.  I suspected that it might take a while to get him to go to sleep and since it was a nice night, I decided to head north out of town. We live in N.E. Wichita just outside of Bel Aire.  I drove North on Oliver to 53rd St. N.  I then turned East on 53rd to Greenwich.  At Greenwich I turned South until 45th St. At 45th St I then proceeded back to the West.  At some point, as I was approaching Rock Rd. (on 45th St.), I noticed a rather large and bright light ahead of me on the horizon.  The light looked white or a white/yellow.  I thought at first it might be a light on the water tower or a radio tower in the distance.  As I continued West on 45th I realized that the water tower and its lights were not in line with this light (which seemed to be stationary).  I passed the water tower and proceeded West on 45th St and could now see the radio tower in the distance an it\u2019s lights. The tower was North of the light in question.  The light at this time had begun to dim and didn\u2019t seem as bright.  It was however in the same position (or so it seemed) as it was when I first noticed it (1.5 miles ago).   As I approached Oliver (sti! ll on 45th St.) the light seemed to be getting lower, as it was now becoming obstructed by trees.  At this time, my best guess was that the light was a mile or two in front of me.  As I approached Hydraulic (still on 45th St.), I stopped for a train which was crossing the road.  I believe there were 2 cars in front of me.  While waiting for the train (2 minutes) the light did not move.  If it did it may have moved toward me.  Just before the train finished passing, the light began to move toward me and to the North.   As I approached the intersection of 45th & Hydraulic I could now see 3 lights in the shape of a triangle. It crossed Hydraulic at approximately 1/4 of a mile to the North of 45th St. The front light (front as in relation to its travel E-NE) was blue in color.  The two rear lights were white or slightly whitish-yellow.  I also noticed that the lights did not blink or flash, as I expected to see a helicopter or some type of plane.  When the object passed over Hydraulic, I e! stimate that it may have been at an altitude of about 1,000 ft.  As it passed over Hydraulic I turned North to try an follow it as it was moving rather slow.  As I traveled further North on Hydraulic I started to lose sight of it out the passenger side of our van.  I approached 53rd St and turned East where I could see it ahead of me.  It seemed to begin moving at a faster rate of speed.  By the time I approached Oliver it was well off in the distance.  I would estimate that it was 10 miles away by that time. I debated whether or not to post this report for fear of some kind of misidentification on my part but after watching the air traffic in the night sky the following days I became more sure about the differences in this object and that of other aircraft.  Most aircraft I\u2019ve seen have some kind of red light, this had none.  The altitude at which the object in question was also odd.  The aircraft I see here are in a landing pattern or take off at that altitude and this object did not fit the typical flight pattern of other aircraft from the surrounding airports.  The main difference was the 3 solid lights beneath the object.  They did not flash or blink. There was also no beacon light on this object.  I believe that at the close proximity in which I was to the object I would have seen a beacon light, however the 3 lights beneath the object were the only ones I could see.  At 45th & Hydraulic (my closest position to the object) it was moving very slow.  I also rolled the windows down a! t that point and could not hear the propellers of a plane or helicopter. Also, I do believe the vehicle stopped in front of me while waiting for the train took notice of it and tried to follow it as well.  The car turned North on Hydraulic then East on 53rd, then South on Oliver back to 45th where it then turned West again on 45th.  The drivers behavior seemed to be very distracted as if they were watching the objects flight. I hope this might encourage others in the Wichita area to consider sharing their sightings as well.",
