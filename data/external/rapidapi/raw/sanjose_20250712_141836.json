      "story": "triangles made of 9 lights--no object seen I submitted an account of this event two or three years ago. It apparently was not received, as it is not in the website database. Since that submission, my recollection of the event has improved and therefore changed somewhat.  This is a recollection of a sighting of unknown lights in an unusual pattern sometime in the early 1970's, perhaps 1973 or 1974. I have tried to remember details and circumstances as accurately as possible. I am no aviation expert but I have grown up around aircraft, living near Reid-Hillview Airport, well before it was purchased by Santa Clara County and became a FSS, and I was acquanted with the former owner, his daughter and her family, as well as others who worked there or had tiedowns or hangars, so I know more than a little bit about aviation. There are some explanations for those who are unfamiliar with aviation as well as to explain why I do not believe that the lights belonged to any ordinary aircraft.  In the early 1970's I was at home during a late spring or summer evening and looked up to see nine orange/amber lights arrayed in three equilateral triangles which were themselves arrayed as one large equilateral triangle. Each orange light was at the point, or vertex, of each small triangle which themselves were at the points of the larger triangle, nine lights in all.  The night was warm and the smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen. There was no moon. Typically, above the smog, I am told there is a strong Westerly wind in the evening and into the night.  The array maintained perfect equilateral triangles as it headed roughly north-northwest in a straight line, It appeared to move slowly, like a light airplane but seemed to be silent. I watched the lights closely for some time, from when it was almost overhead, as it passed overhead and then was lost in the smog and reflected city lights somewhere over the north part of the city, trying to see the outline of some object and watching the lights to see if any moved independently, as well as for any lateral drift. I never could see any object, just the lights, none of the lights moved relative to the others and no lateral drift was observed. I estimated it could be seen for at least fifteen minutes.  The array was unusual as no navigation lights were seen: No red, no green, no white, no strobe or flashing lights of any kind, just steady orange/amber lights, which I realised later had the same color as low-pressure sodium street lights.  I know what aircraft look like in the sky at night, as I lived next to a small civil airport at that time and lived directly under the southbound departure route for the city's major airport and I often watched aircraft go over, trying to guess what kind it was. Sometimes, because of the smog, all that can be seen are the navigation lights. I have never seen such lights on any aircraft before or since. It occurred to me that the aircraft might have been some of the new SR-12's recently made public but the lights never moved relative to each other, they never drifted from course and there were no navigation lights, as would be required near the airports under VFR rules.  There was no engine noise. At the time, jet engines were still quite loud and some DC9's, 727's and 737's, as well as DC8's from Mexico were still using turbojets instead of the quieter fans. Neither turbine nor piston engines were heard.  The array was viewed through smog which reflected the streetlights so there was only a view of the orange/amber lights. No solid object was seen, no reflections. The smog was thick enough that no stars could be seen, neither could any aircraft from either airport. But somehow those lights could be seen.  Because of the smog,  the exceptionally slow speed and the lack of any visible shape I could not determine the altitude or the size of the object or objects attached to the lights.  I asked around to see if anyone else had seen the aray of lights; no one had. The FAA and the local newspaper both pointedly expressed their lack of interest in the event. It remained forgotten until I saw another very unusual sky object while in Monterey. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

What seemed like a low shadow crossed over the house and made everything dark, I looked around, at time I had computor on and was listening to a talk show. Just as the shadow passed, appr. 3 sec everything in the kitchen started to dim, out the side of my eyes I saw other things that were not in use coming on, makeing noise, you could feel a pressure in the house as power  started to flow up. Then everything in the house went off.  The power was off for about two seconds then it came back on.  My daughter down stairs came running up, talked about the shadow and started telling us that things that were on started making a strange noise and things that were off started coming on and were squealing.  She could feel the power flowing from the house. After an hour I can still feel the pressure of this and had started to get a headache from it. Not a stranger to power cutting out, I have to tell you this was different.  Never have I felt power going straight up.  About two min later you could hear high flying military planes flying in the direction of the shadow out over the ocean.",

For two weeks prior to the sighting, I had experienced telepathic communication with these beings.  I was waiting for the time of their arrival.  I spoke to no one of this at the time, and have only shared my experience witha few extremely close friends since the encounter.  I knew I would be called to the site telepathicly when they would arrive in my area.  It wsa Sunday afternoon around 4PM, when I felt drawn to Stevens Creek Blvd.  I  entered Town and Country Shopping Center's parking lot a \"back way\" and when I pulled in, there was a group of people standing under the craft, which hovered about 20 feet in the air--- just above the rooftop.  It was close to a Tobacco store.  The man who worked in the store was one of hte witnesses.  I walked closer to the group, and had made the decision NOT to go with the beings prior to this physical encounter.  After standing with the  group[ for a ew more minutes---looking up to the bottom of the  craft, the craft raised upward without movement of air, or sound --no heat was felt---nothing.  It increased speed rapidly, and then dissapeared in an instant.  We all looked at each other, and dispersed in silence.  The experience was profound, and even more so because we had witnessed it together.  I have been looking in various places to see if any of the other witnesses have reported it, but I have not seen evidence of the sighting.  It affected me so  intensly, Ihad to report it--even though  it occurred all these years ago.  No one was abducted to my knowledge.  My comunication with them was indicative of a volulnteer scenario, and I was not willing to participate, but have the connection with them telepathicly.

I also experienced the intermittent, fairly loud roaring sound that other people reported here around San Jose on the evening of Feb. 6th at approximately 11:00 PM. It seemed to be a deep, low, intense rumbling off in the distance from my southwest San Jose location, that would stop and then start back up again. I could easily hear it while sitting and listening puzzledly at my computer within my enclosed apartment. I soon went outside and scanned the night sky, but couldn't see any aircraft that might be causing it. I even called a friend on the phone who lives a few doors down, but he didn't hear anything because of the volume of his TV.  I have heard something exactly like this several times before over the years in the Santa Clara Valley, and surmised that it could have been the NASA Ames wind tunnel that was producing it. That's what I had read in the newspaper and saw reported on TV previously when I had heard this same kind of sound in years past.  Also, there is/was? a rocket motor test facility south of San Jose that could also be capable of producing this same kind of noise.  I'm not sure if either the wind tunnel or this rocket test facility are still currently in operation, but they both could be possible explanations for these sounds. Also, I thought it might possibly a loud jet engine at the airport, not following anti-noise procedures. Curfew at Mineta San Jose International Airport begins at 11:00 PM, but jets sometimes still do operate after that.",

      "story": "Two Disks or Saucers seen gliding side by side before doing some acrobatic maneuvers. It was around 5:20pm when I was leaving work to go home. As I was going around toward the driver's side of my car, I happened to look upward at the sky. It was then that I saw two round disks or saucer shaped objects gliding through the air side by side. They did not move any faster than if you were watching a bird fly against the wind. They appeared to be very dark in color, not reflecting any light from the sun which was now setting at the horizon. The two disks were gliding side by side with only what seemed like a yard or two of space apart. They glided over the two story building that I worked at, traveling west to east making no audible noise that I could hear over the sound of traffic nearby. I was trying hard to make some sense of what I was seeing. Not birds...not balloons...certainly not any conventional airplanes. Perhaps, they were very large round kites that got away from someone who was testing them out. But, there was hardly any wind at all. What is keeping them a float and moving along steady without much wind, I thought.  Satisfied with the idea of some new kite invention that went astray, I unlocked and opened my car door.  Before getting in, I looked upward once more just in time to see the two disk shaped objects begin tumbling through the air and then occasionally spinning around each other at a very rapid rate of acceleration and then in opposite directions. Obviously, this was a complete shock. Despite the crazy tumbling and rapid acceleration of spining around each other, the disks avoided a collision as though there was some kind of invisible force field that kept them from hitting each other. ALL the while, they still maintained a steady course in an easterly direction. This sighting took place in no more than one minute before it passed out of view behind nearby trees. I would put the height of these objects at the same height you would see most small planes fly. I would give my best judgement that the diameter of these twin disk if at ground level could have been between 9 to 11 feet. The last few seconds of this sighting convinced me that these objects were controled by some kind of advanced technology, because of the unusual accelerations and manuvers of the objects. Possibly, a new generation of nerds working on a special project for a start up company may be behind this. Time will tell!",

I was standing on a train platform in San Jose California, I had just checked my radio controlled Casio wristwatch watch, it was 1:38 pm, when my coworker our engineer said hey look there, he was pointing up in the sky towards the east by south east. I looked where he was pointing, the sky was very clear there were a lot of clouds as we were having rain showers that day, which made the sky very clear and free of dust and pollutants.  What I saw, at first glance, I and my coworker thought to be a weather balloon moving from east by south east towards north by north west in a straight line, moving at a high rate of speed. However, I quickly realized it was moving against the prevailing winds which were pushing the clouds in a northeasterly direction.  The object I believe to be small about the size of a midsized compact car. The object appeared to have a shape similar to a light bulb. The front was round and it tapered to a small almost pointed tail. The object was brightly polished gold metallic in color as the front bulbous area reflected the sun as it moved away from us.  The object was well above the clouds, its speed did not vary, and the object did not tumble or roll or vary its direction. We are just about one mile from the San Jose International Air Port. The jet planes that were crossing over at this time were moving much slower than the object.  The object did not leave a trail behind it, neither was there a flame coming out its tail end, it did not have wings, and it did not have a tail that would control its movement.  As the object was moving directly over us its bottoms color seemed to very in intensity like waves in a darker shade that moved from the front to the rear.  From the time we started to observe the object the object remained in sight for about 40 to 45 seconds.",

      "story": "Roaring noise over house that started and stopped suddenly four times, appearing to originate from different directions. My girlfriend and I were watching TV in our room at around 11:00 PM when we heard a very loud roaring that sounded much like a large rocket booster and seemed to be right above the house. We live very near the San Jose International Airport, so hearing roaring noises in the sky is not unusual. What WAS unusual, however, was the volume, behavior, and the proximity of the sound to our home. \tThe normal flight path of aircraft into San Jose international airport puts them a few miles east of our home. However, whatever was causing the sound seemed to be directly above our house. Furthermore, it didn\u2019t get louder (approaching our home) and then quieter (passing over and leaving our home). Rather, it was a very loud, very steady roaring noise that sounded as if it was directly over our home. \tWe were lying in bed, and we both heard this roaring in the background as we were watching TV. The longer it went on without changing in pitch or volume (which would be an indication of movement towards or away from our home), the more that sort of \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong here\u201d alarm was going off in my head. Finally, after about three minutes of this steady roaring, we both looked at each other at the same time and vocalized our mutual curiosity as to the nature of that sound. She said, \u201cwhat is that noise?\u201d. I jokingly replied that it was probably a UFO, and she should pack her nice clothes because we might be about to take a ride. As soon as I had finished saying that, the sound stopped instantly. There was no winding down, there was no lowing of decibels, it was as if someone had just flicked a switch and turned it off. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, it started up again after a few seconds in what seemed to be a different part of the sky, but still very close. The start of the sound was as instantaneous as the ending. It was just suddenly \u201con\u201d again. Again, there was an extremely loud, very steady roaring for about a minute, and then it stopped suddenly. \tAt this point my girlfriend was actually getting scared. She had lived in this area all her life and had NEVER heard anything like this before. When the roaring started a third time, I jumped through our window into the back yard (there was no screen) so I could get a better look at the night sky to try and get a visual on whatever was causing this noise. I was able to determine that the roaring seemed to be coming from the South, but was unable to see the source. I ran over to the patio door and knocked on it to get the attention of my roommate who was playing video games at the time, and told him to come out and listen. He did, and said to me, \u201cit\u2019s probably just an airplane.\u201d Then it stopped suddenly, as it had done twice before and his attitude changed. Again, it had lasted about a minute and stopped for a few seconds only to start up again this time on the NORTH side of my home. Now he was clearly as curios as I was about the origin of this sound. The rumbling/roaring sound went on for about thirty seconds or so this time before it again stopped suddenly. It did not start up again.",

I noticed it about 11 pm while watching for a reported meteor shower expected.  I noticed at first it was entremely bright. Then noticed that an obvious commercial aircraft seemed to be heading for it.  The questioned unidentified aircraft \"flashed\" lights at the commercial aircraft and the commercial aircraft veered away to an entirely different direction of travel. I got out binoculars and looked closer at the unknown \"light\" in the sky and realized it was NOT something normal.  It appeared to be cigar or saucer shaped with 4 very bright lights acroos.  Occasionally the lights would dim to the point of being not visible to the naked eye. While observing thru the binoculars I observed that when this happened, the lights on the craft would change shape becoming shaped like a blackslash which grew more and more narrow, over a period of several seconds.  Then the lights would open fully again becoming very very bright. I watched this aircraft for approximately 2 1/2 hours.  During this time NO airplanes whatsoever flew over, which is quite unusual because this is a normal regularly busy flight path for San Francisco airport as well as San Jose. The craft simply hovered there in place.  There has NEVER been anything shaped even similarly in the sky, there is no way this could have been an airplace, helicopter, nothing commonly known. I called my brother, who lives several miles closer to the approximate estimated spot the craft was hovering.  He went outside and IMMEDIATELY spotted it and said, oh *hit, I think we are in trouble.  He too observed the lights on it changing but described that as a \"sweeping\" function, as tho the craft were searching around it's perimiter, then would return to the simple hovering state. I noticed my cell phone reception was very poor during this time - background noise, static, bleedover noise. I made a point of observing for a long time, so that i would be certain this was not a product of my imagination or blurred vision or misinterpretation.  IT WAS NOT.",

Thank you, again, for sharing the information with our Center!  Cordially,  Peter Davenport, Director NUFORC ((END NOTE)) ((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, This object was 1/4  the size of the moon. (Same brightness as a full moon)  Not a satellite as I have seen many satellites and the movement of this,  was, in comparison, similar to that of a shooting star in terms of rapidity.   From my field of view the object covered about  half of the horizon from my bedroom window in those few seconds. It  was traveling at an incredible  rate of speed without sound.     I had, in fact, last year reported something very similar on your network, however the size of this was remarkable today.  Coincidentally, the former sighting occurred at roughly the same time of day, although that object was traveling from North to South. Could it be North Korea? Ha! ((name deleted))",

They Gray had slanted eyes and words can't describe the skin.  I just know it glowed like the moon times 5.  Well, it showed up right next to my face and I flipped over to look up at the ceiling because my heart was pounding like it was gonna explode out my chest because I was so scared at the time and then it was gone when I looked over.  Don't know what it wanted from me because I ain't got nothing it wants. Never heard or seen from it again.  Didn't know who to report it too at that time so was just a memory. Just watched 4th kind and it sparked answers. That's all I remembered. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Small disc hovers over our backyard. It was a beautiful cloudless day and my two kids and I were in the backyard. They were running around playing and I was BBQing.  As I was cooking something caught my eye to the West. At first I thought someone was burning something in there backyard about 3 houses down from me.  Let me give you a perspective:  It looked like a cloud of smoke hanging in the air about 10 feet about the roof line.  It was as big as a small RV.  As I looked at the cloud I thought is was odd. Then the whole thing moved.. it went south and did a small u-turn and stopped right over our backyard.  My kids were very excited and got behind me as I was looking at this cloud that moved as if it were being driven. There were no distant lines to it ..it was cloaked. It was so close I could have picked up a rock and smacked it very easily. There was no sound or lights at this point. It was just hanging in the air over our backyard.  At this point we were all very excited when all of a sudden a portion of the cloud kind of rolled back and we saw a bank of about 7 rectangular lights. Each light was about 8 X 4 inches. I saw the lights as multicolored, my kids saw the lights as all one color; purple.  Then the cloud rolled back over where the lights were and flew to the north faster then anything I\u2019ve every seen and it disappeared very quickly.  After it flew away I told my daughter to go in the house and draw what you saw. She did this before any of us discussed the event. A few minutes later she came back with a drawing of what we all saw except she draw the color of the lights as all purple as where I saw multicolors.",

A week or so later, I seem to remember reports of thunderstorms in San Francisco, I tried to have my citizenship changed at the Philippine Consulate general.  There were two Caucasian Filipinas at the Consulate who said something about the Embassy of France, and one of them said, \u201cThank you\u201d to the people at the customer service window. A few days later, I was walking on Velasco Drive, also a block away from my street, when I saw a round black object appear in the western sky.    It was surrounded by a rainbow-colored halo, and it moved slowly through the grey sky until it set behind the Santa Teresa foothills. I saw the Filipinas again in a dream I had in February 2009. I have tried to get out of the assault situation by reporting a dream about my boyfriend Quetzalcoatl from Rolling Thunder, the Cherokee shaman, on May 14, 2009, after which I woke up crying and made some hot chocolate, along with other information, to the Records Office of UC San Francisco Medical Center where my mother drove me on the day I was assaulted .

It was about 200 to 300 yards away I have more than perfect 20/20 vision I can see perfect far and close. I noticed the chemtrail coming out of the back of the plane when the orb appeared and did three full circles around the chemtrail itself and then flew to the very end of the chemtrail and back to the very front of the chemtrail right behind the plane. After that it quickly broke away from the chemtrail and flew towards Valley Fair mall about maybe 50 to 100 yards closer. It then did a sudden sharp turn and seemed to slowly and leisurely fly toward the Mount Hamilton area and disappeared. The orb was silver and smooth I could not see any widows, lights, markings, or contrails coming from it.",

I thought it was a strange constellation and they weren't blinking and suddenly I realized that they were moving directly away from me flying to the southeast. After about five seconds, they faded away from my view. Conditions were about half an hour or so after sunset, and mostly clear with just a bit of haze. The two lights appeared to be moving away in tandem with what I can only describe as a \"gliding\" motion, not fast, but not really slow, either. The courtyard is lit with orange vapor lanterns. I would describe the brigtness of the object or objects as being of medium intensity, and they were unblinking. My friend was facing toward me, so he didn't observe them. A small plane flew into the immediate area of the sky about a minute or so later, and looked quite different from what I previously saw. I would estimate that the objects were at about a 45 degree angle in the sky from my position and fairly high as I observed them over a two story apartment building. I could not hear any sound from either the objects or from the small plane, as there was traffic noise coming in from the busy street that we reside on.",

This object was so bright and beautiful I dropped my laptop and ran back inside to get my mother.  I was so excited, I was screaming at her to hurry.  She and I then exited our home and walked to the driveway.   The object was still positioned in the air, displaying a large mass of bright color spectrum.  While I was watching this object, my mother started to get panicked and ran towards the house and stopped.  While I was watching the one object, my mother started screaming at me to look at another one.  The one I was viewing started to dimmer and slowly lifted upwards and left view.  As I was turning down the steps towards our home, my mother said oh my God, Oh my God look...I didn't see the second one.  She states that the second one was just as bright but \"shot\" through the sky from right to left, then stopped on a dime, then again shot across from right to left and disappeared as fast as it had appeared.

I was up on one of our towers on monument peak, swapping out an access point, when the other technician with me. Looked out to the left where our office was in San Jose.  And yelled at me to look.  When I looked out, I saw a gray, sphere object omitting light from it.   I watched it for several seconds.  Just wondering what it was.  And then I could see the omitting light, began to intensify.  till it got to a point where it was close to being as bright as the sun.  Which was over to my right, high up in the sky.  Far away from this object.  One the object got to this point it sustained that level of brightness, and appeared to come towards the Hill we where on.  But then Stopped, omitting such a bright light and resumed its greyish/soft omitting light. Right after that, I kinda sweep the whole bay, from where I was, and now saw 3 identical small objects show up in sequence, and at parallel height. (could draw a straight line through all 4)   At that point, I was panicking, and wanted to get off the 25ft tower I was on, and rush to my truck, just down the hill to grab my camera. (Truck was about 500 ft away from the antenas) So I did and returned with my camera. The first main object was gone, and the other 3 behind it where leaving in sequence as well. I was able to snap off pictures of the 4th orb/sphere/object, which was closer to San Francisco, out over the south Bay. I've been up there 30-40 times this year, I have never seen any lights up there that could compare, ive never seen any reflections that could compare or have ever been 1/10th as bright as these in clear sunny day light conditions.

I was walking out from a friend\u2019s house to go home at 23:50 PM on Sunday, July 9th when i looked down the street and saw a red light. It was a bright light in the sky, far away in the distance. It looked like a star, but it was red, and far brighter than any star I have ever seen (besides the sun). It was too bright and did not move like a plane or helicopter, too slow to be a satellite or a shooting star.  Similarly, the red light\u2019s movement was erratic thus eliminating any-other known celestial body following a constant orbital path.  It was just above the trees down the street, in the southwestern sky. I called back to my friend, who was walking back inside, to come look at the light. We watched the light for approximately 20 minutes. Over the course of the 20 minutes the light grew fainter and fainter.  It went higher into the sky for about ten minutes, then started moving further south for about five minutes. It moved very slowly. It moved like it was ! the first stroke of writing a \"Y,\" going up (from the base of the \"Y\"), and to the left.  After about 10 minutes I called another friend with my cell phone and told him to go outside and look at the light. He saw it too. After watching the light for fifteen minutes, it stopped moving. It was dimming faster than it was before. It would flicker, get slightly dimmer, then brighten again. Every time it flickered it would become slightly less bright. Then when it became as dim as the stars around it, it started flashing and falling towards the earth. It moved faster than it did when it was moving in the previous 20 minutes. It appeared to be in a free-fall. It fell for about 30 seconds then stopped flashing and we couldn\u2019t see it anymore. I could still see it for about 3 seconds after the light went out. I could see the object similarly to the way you can still see brightness from dimming embers.  Then we lost track of it and didn\u2019t see it again.",

It moved slowly at first and then before it disappeared moved quite rapidly.   At first it moved quite slowly, drifting to the right and then arcing over to the left.  Then it took a straight line to the left and quickly rising and eventually disappearing.  The light was solid and then quickly flickered before it disappeared.  The object looked like it might have been in the shape of a boomerang, but was really high in the sky to confirm.

Then this red light jumped over to our right at the same altitude it was at approx 2 miles from its starting point in the sky. It then began to flash very quickly and got brighter then dimmer flashing, then it decended the distance it traveled over the last 45 minutes or so in about 3 seconds flashing brighter and then slowing down and gettting dimmer, then getting brighter and faster again. at the end of its decent it got dimmer and turned a whitish color and as it was speeding off just disappeared.

Through the window facing west at about 45 degrees in the sky, we saw two bright white lights vertically aligned and moving in unison, from our distant view the lights were about 1\" apart. The top light got brighter and changed colors to an amber red for second. These lights were seen west of San Jose, towards the Pennisula and the Bay. We see many planes and helicopters in this area so we know how they appear in the sky; these lights were much more brilliant - both were as bright as a rising Venus at certain times of the year. I could not detect any sound. As they dropped below our sight, they kept the same vertical alignment, same distance apart, and moved at the same rate of speech.  It was as if an invisible string was attaching the lower light. What is this?  My husband thinks it was helicopter. I am not sure.",

The oval appeared to have numerous additional lights around the periphery. The object was silent. I saw no sign of navigation lights, flashing lights, or strobes.

Ive been seeing these ufos for over a year now so when i saw it i knew to run to my car and get my camera(that i carry with me all the time now).   On the way to the car i spot another brighter white star below i to the right.  So im looking back and fourth between my daughter(8yrs old) and the two white orbs, when out of thin air a third red orb appears to the right of the white orbs.  They are approaching my location from the east at about the speed of a small plane, at this point im running to my car for camera.  When i get my camera they are just about overhead, the first orb i spotted is quite faint and looks like a small star at a high altitude. The other two however, to my amazement, have changed thier shape.  They appear like two small crescent moons, one bright white the other bright red, and they are slowly spinning.  The spinning motion is not constant, the spinning is fast at times then! slow at other times, going one way then the other.  Both the red and white \"moons\" are spining but independently, at this point even my daughter is kinda freaking out.  The other star like one was still slightly off to the left of the two spinning \"moons\" but kinda just floated along with them from the east to the west.  So now these things are above me and i actually can see them in my cameras view finder.  I do get 8 pictures of the two spinning moon like objects and accidently get a 2sec video. When i got the pics home and inspected them closer i was excited, although the pics don't do the sighting justice some of the detail when zoomed in i could not see with the naked eye.  After seeing the detail ive concluded that they were not only spining they were changing shape. In the pictures you will see the two spining/changing ones, but the third starlike one was there above to the left out of view.  The sighting ended with the object flying over the homes/trees that i was standi! ng next to and out of sight. The only thing i would like to ad! d was as im on the sidewalk next to my daughter,taking pictures and both of us looking up, about a dozen kids with parents also leaving the school walked by me. Almost as amazing as the ufos flying above my head was that NOT ONE person asked me what we were taking pictures of or even bothered to look up to see what i was looking at for almost 5 min. This truly disturbed me, i wanted to scream look up, but it just felt awkward so i didn't. In retrospect i wish i would have tho. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the objects are clusters of balloons.

I have witnessed this object multiple times in the past, so i was prepared and grabbed my camera from my desk.  Just seconds later i was outside my front door with the camera, at this point it was almost directly above me.  Again it appered as a white star but changed red, then a few more times from white to red, but not always a complete change sometimes only half way. I do take pictures as it slowly floats over my house.  I go to my backyard to get a better view and it now apperars much higher/smaller and is now just a white dot in the sky, and it is now almost stationary. I observe it for another 10 min, then it slowly faded away, i tried to take more pics but was largely unsuccessful.  It is very difficult to see with the naked eye! so its twice as hard to get on my cameras view finder (cannon 10x optical zoom digital camera).   I do my best and snap pictures anyways most of the time i see this thing, most dont come out and the ones that do usually just show a white or red dot in the sky.   Needless to say disappointing, however this time two of the pictures came out with some good detail if zoomed in.  When i witnessed the object i didnt see the detail that shows in the picture.  I think its because the pictures were shot when the object was changing colors, and in real time it happens almost instantly and the change is self is not really visible.  p.s. I just found out as i was typing this report that Usama bin laden is dead at the hand of US forces. An interesting day for sure",

Flight path:  Approx: East to West with a slight arc upwards at the end. I observed  red fireball in the sky, that changed size and brightness.  It appeared to \u201cflare up\u201d to a bright reddish ball about twice the size of Jupiter, then would lose luminosity  and size to become a dull red color and about the size of Jupiter.  Even more interesting it would shrink down to about half the size of Jupiter, turn  a dull gray color, and looked almost oval.  It repeated this pattern several times before slightly arching upwards, then it sort of faded out of sight  in approx. 10 sec.   The entire sighting lasted  90 sec.  My mother observed this as well but didn\u2019t want to report this herself  (sorry Mr. davenport).  What appered to be a Southwest passenger jet was in the air at this time.  My phone camera could not pick up the object. I am a father of two kids, a homeowner, and a logical person.  I have no reason to lie, and only reporting this because I\u2019ve seen these \"fireballs\" about 15 times through the summer of 2010.  I just want to know what they are. I doubt I will find out though.",

      "story": "Please read these abductions going on with a 41yo male. **PLEASE DON'T USE MY REAL NAME**  I will tell you my story. Well, here it goes, I am a 41 yo who had a heart transplant in 2001 and a stroke which left my right side partially limited.  I was living in San Jose and had a fantastic position with an international hi-tech firm doing project management in Palo Alto.  It was a great future in store for me, and I was very excited to be a part of it.  I am living north now in McKinleyville, CA. From what I can remember in the past:  5 years old:  I was climbing on the outer railing when I fell off the second floor and right before I landed on my back on the tiles, I felt my body being set down very slowly.  Being five I thought that was really neat and ran into the kitchen to tell my Grandmother who got angry and scolded me telling my \"You're full of \"cazzata\" which translates to \"Bull S****\" and scolded me to my room. I never forgot that moment even for a second. At the age of 24: I was away at collage and living in an old c.1894 house with four other students.  For about two months at least 2 mornings per week I had a series of waking up and being completely unable to move anything except for my eyes for approx 30 minutes.  Another thing was the \"weight\" that heavily pressed my body into the mattress, it felt like someone was on top of me. That was a disturbing times but it ceased at two months.  Not ever was I into 'ghosts' but that made me serious about wondering if they really exist.  I searched the old house at Humboldt State University's library and found that the 1894 house was built right over the ashes of a previous building.  The wondering about a ghost faded as I was in an intensive program that needed my focus. 2 years ago: I woke up in my bed and looked at my watch seeing that three days had passed with no recollection of anything. I was extremely upset about it and went to my Doctor who took a blood test and everything was normal.  I did not tell him about why I was so frazzled.  In addition I had multiple dreams where I was unable to move except for turning my head.  It was a very strange room with two other tables with people laying on them and again there was a being 8-9 feet tall wearing an outfit with a hood and shielding for the face working on the body to my right.  I can recall turning my head to the left where small rectangle windows looking down at Clam Beach from I guess around 7000 feet, just a guess.  During the two years I had multiple dreams like that. The last week:  The last night for the third time in the past week I dreamt of being in an underground 'lab?' or some kind of very large underground facility 'people' of two types.  One type was 8-9 feet tall and the other was 'human-like' who can communicate using their minds.  (I feel like I'm going crazy.)  They were very calm and 'loving.'  There are dozens of windows in the rock where the 'humans' would live, they would open into the rock.  I would wake up and fall right back into the same dream.  I have noticed new skin-marks and two new tiny scars. I live alone, my family is in So. California. That's my story and you may do what you like with it, but again, PLEASE DO NOT USE MY NAME. Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It made no noise and had no visible means of propulsion. It was completely bare, just solid chrome/nickel with the blue tint on the bottom.  I know this is going to sound strange, but it looked like it was just floating there, except for the fact that it was moving fast through the air.  This was in a heavily populated area in the middle of the day right over homes. I pulled my car over to get a better look.  As I got out of my car, the craft was now about a half of a mile behind me.  By the time my eyes found the craft (it was so low that it didn't take long for it to leave my field of view) it just faded away into nothing.  It just ! disappeared.

No blinking lights were visible and no sound of audible, only solid white lights of similar brightness of a satellite or medium bright star.   At approximately 10 seconds into the sighting, the lead craft accelerated and separated at a high rate of speed.  The trailing craft light became less visible then invisible to the eye at about 15-20 seconds into the sighting, the lead craft which had accelerated away was visible until it disappeared into the horizon.  Judging from the angle, I would have to guess the craft were flying at 60,000 - 70,000 feet.    The amount of time to cross the entire horizon from first sighting was roughly 35 seconds maximum.

      "story": "Two Oval Shaped Craft Flying Low and Extremely Fast in Tandem Formation Over San Jose California! I was released from the San Jose hospital on December 9th in the afternoon and it was a very nice sunny day with no clouds in the sky and shortly after arriving to my home I was resting in a chair in my back yard facing to the South at around 4pm when all of the sudden I noticed two oval shaped objects come into my vision from deep in the Western sky.  They were traveling together and within very close proximity of each other just as two side by side blue angel jets do when they fly in tandem formation during air shows. After they had caught my eyes attention, I focused directly on them for approximately 7 seconds as they went from the far right hand side of the Western sky all the way to the left of the Eastern sky.  I tried to get my friend\u2019s attention who was standing to my left and facing me to turn around and look at the two fast flying ufo\u2019s.   As he had turned to face them, they were already two thirds the way across the sky which caused me to get up out of my chair and walk forward passing by my friend to catch the last glimpse of them as they went over the far Eastern hills. The two ufo\u2019s were traveling at approximately 4,000 feet above the ground and were about 3 miles or so out away from my home and seemed to be traveling at a speed of at least 1,000 plus miles per hour as it appeared from the distance that they had covered in such a quick time. The way I figured their speed at about 1,000 plus miles an hour is because I lived near the San Jose airport which is about 2 miles North West of the home that I was living in at the time and I use to watch the incoming and out going planes flying overhead all of the time in the sky at about the same distance that I had watched the two oval shaped ufo\u2019s flying and they don\u2019t cover anywhere near the distance of skyline in such a short period of time that the two ufo\u2019s did in that day of December!   Everything that I have mentioned in this statement is 100% true and as accurate as I can remember.  My eyesight is 20 20 in my right eye and 10 20 in my left eye which is much better than average, so, what I was looking  at was very clear to my eyesight!",

They hung in the air and upon closer inspection I could see them moving across the sky in a relatively equidistant triangular pattern.   After about three minutes they seemed to get very far away or dim quickly (it was hard to tell) and winked out. This is driving me crazy because I am skeptical about these things and my first instinct was that these were some type of weather balloons or chinese lanterns due to the appearance of them floating and being a fire-y red/orange but there was something very strange about them that I couldn't put my finger on that made me continue to watch until they disappeared.

The reason I noticed this was odd is because it did not fly on the standard flight paths used by military or commercial planes following over and into San Jose International Airport.  The military craft fly over south-west San Jose at about 30-40000 feet, nightly every 15 minutes or so. I noticed this object-light was different so I ran in the house to get a camera. Within the 15 or 20 seconds of getting the camera and getting back outside, the object-light was gone...I could not believe it.  I know spaceships exist, and have no doubt, so I started looking for it directly above the earth. Behold, about 30 to 40,000 feet I saw a saucer shaped object flying over ahead continuing toward San Francisco.

The interesting thing about this light and tail was it did not appear falling from outer space as though it was coming through the atmosphere. It only seemed to leave a tail in the lower half of the sky.  Normally when an object falls from space you see a tail in the top half of the sky which burns out in the lower half.  This was opposite, the tail dropped from half-way up in the sky into the earth horizon of Mt umunhum. Coincidentally about an half-hour later I was walking and noticed two lights flying low over the Mt umunhum mountain range.  At first look it seemed like one object, but later after they turned south I noticed the lights were independent.  It was two separate objects, presenting a flight path similar to a military excerise flying over mountains.  Very unusual to see in a very populated San Jose Bay Area.  They were not flying the usual flight paths. The fascinating thing about the ojects was that they had a glow of green-yellow-white lights similar to the object that fell vertical out of the sky about 30 minutes eariler. These are just two of the six incidents of UFO objects I have seen around Mt umunhum in the past 6 weeks.

      "story": "2 orange lights moving in the sky non typically in San Jose CA 9:50 PM Aug 10th, Friday night in San Jose CA, intersection of Camden Ave and Crystal Springs, my daughter and her friend (They are 13) and I (I am 43) were taking a walk around the block like I\u2019ve done many times before.  The sky was very clear, as we walked up Crystal Springs away from Camden Ave about \u00bd way up the street I looked up to the left ( about 60-70% up in height in the sky) and there were 2 orange, what looked like bright stars, amongst the stars. These stood out because they were about 2-3X the size of others and were bright orange amongst all the other white stars. I pointed them out to the two girls with me and we watched them for about 5-10 min. At first they were stationary, then one started to move down and at an angle.  After moving a distance, in terms of the size of the light, about 20-30 times it size down,  it turned at a sharp right angle and traveled about 10-20 times it\u2019s size to the right and stopped. Then it started up toward the ! other to a point that I thought it was going to go right into the other, then about 2-3 times it size away from the other, it stopped. From there in descended again, this time its light starting to flicker  and reduce in its brilliance, several times it almost went out but then lit up again, all the while it was descending, then it faded one last time and was gone. The other remained there and then it too descended and flickered and then at last it was gone entirely.  All 3 of us were watching the whole time and the kids were asking me what I thought it was, all I could say was that it was not an airplane, not a satellite, not a star, I\u2019d never seen anything that color in the sky move in those directions and then disappear, so I said it must be a UFO. When we retuned to the house, I sat in my back yard hoping to see something else looking up in the sky. While I did not see any more orange lights moving about, at 10:10PM my entire peripheral vision saw what looked like a meteorite streak across the sky with its tail in full view the entire time even after passing for a moment, it was lower than any shooting star I\u2019ve ever seen, I would have thought it was the height of a high flying airplane. In the morning I looked hoping to see something in the local news paper but here was nothing so I Googled \u201cstrange lights in the sky\u201d and saw clip after clip about just such orange lights. Then I Googled \u201cStrange lights in the sky last night\u201d and did see a post about someone in another state and possibly another county on the same Friday night, same time frame, seeing the same thing. Looking up now more often than even before\u2026.",

Approximately   10:30 p.m. my wife and I were in our back yard hot tub sitting and waiting to see the meteor shower that was to take place from the  northeast of San Jose, Ca..  I was staring up at a star formation that looks like a W.   At that time the two objects that were elongated diamond shaped, flew in front of the stars that I was looking at.  They were black, the same color as the night sky, the only reason that I could see the outline of the crafts was the light from the city was reflecting on the outer edges of each craft.  There was no sound when they passed, nor was there any sound barrier noise. My eyes then followed them, looking up at about a 45 degree angle and told my wife to quickly look the direction that they were flying.   They were in formation, side by side.  From our backyard they flew from the north, (from the direction of San Francisco towards the south, Monterey, ca.).  It only took 4-5 seconds for them to pass at high speed.  We don\u2019t know what we saw? UfO? Or Black Ops?   Did anyone else see these objects? There is an International airport near us and planes fly in and out all the time, these were not planes.",

Based upon the location, I assumed it was military as the coloration was different and appeared in the same vicinity from my vantage point as Moffett Field in Mountain View, California. Upon assent, it was apparent that the object was a missile of sorts as it had a distinct amber trail.  As it climbed in elevation, the relative perceived speed provided a clue the object was much further away that originally thought. It appear to reach the upper atmosphere and the object's propulsion begin to lighten in intensity and then disappear.  I then asked two family members to witness the remaining two launches.  I believe this was probably launched from a vessel at sea given the distance. It appears the path was due South from a launch point somewhere near the Farallon Islands. I don't believe this was extra terrestrial, just some sort of military testing however I can't believe I would have been the only one seeing this as there was plenty of commercial and private aircraft traffic airborne at the time. Now at least there is one documented sighting.",

The lights were moving in a straight line almost like cars then began shaping into what appeared to be buildings, meaning they looked like long horizontal rectangles.   Then the lights started to scatter around, then start to go into a V formation which started flying over to our direction and it was HUGE!  Once it got just about over the car to the right it totally disappeared. There was plenty of traffic so im sure the cars around us noticed it as well. there were so many lights moving around and once it took on that V formation theres no way anyone could miss it, even if they werent looking up it was that big.   Hopefully more people can make a report to verify what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a time for the sighting, so we have assigned an arbitrary time above.

I live in South San Jose (Almaden) and first spotted UFOs over the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve on 16th June at 8.50 pm - my wife saw them too.  I took this video (on my phone) the next night when just one UFO appeared at the same time, and hung around for 15 minutes.  On both occasions, the objects emitted white, green and red slow pulsing light.  They object in this video moves from side to side across the sky and at times soars high above the mountains in the distance.  It's hard to see just how bright the light is from this video, but the objects really shone when at their brightest then fade to almost disappear before glowing again.  I estimate the UFO is about a mile away from where I filmed this, which should be close enough to hear some sound from a conventional aircraft, but there was complete silence.

On the right is an animal clinic in the field to the left of their building above a small field was a oval light bright blue with a red dome. Husband turned around I saw it above some trees bottom was bright white tipped slightly so I could see abit of red and blue lights. We stopped we got out looked south and the back end was a large white light.  When I first saw it it was beautiful full color, but there was a small white flash I wonder if it had trouble.  Hovering.It took us 20 seconds to turn around and it had just made it to the tree line of this small railroad ravine.20 mph? After stopping and watching the white light go south we feel it kicked it up to maybe 45mph still low just above tree height. Full moon, wind out of North East. Radio station in Springfield had no reports, Channel 20 Springfield had no reports and I think they were abit amused. Went and scouted area this morning and it amazed me just how close it really was.  After went to minimart and asked if any one had seen it but no luck. Learned a valuable lesson always have my phone with camera with me because you never know.  Plan on being near tonight just in case a return. and one more thing.  The UFO was so colorful and bright you could not see any structure non at all no sound absolutely amazing.  I've always thought they live by 3 rules number 1 don't get caught 2 they are big showoffs and 3 let's mess with the humans and see if we can't get get them good and rattled..Going to make some phone calls to see if farther north anything was reported.",

      "story": "Orange red fireball seen 4 times above San Jose, Ca.  8/3/13 8/4/13--  I was sitting in my back yard last night with 2 friends discussing a upcoming vacation.   It was about 11:30pm pst.   I was facing directly East,  and was looking up at the stars ( because normally you can't see them...). It was slightly cloudy,  kind of hazy out and in the mid 60's.   The eastern sky was the only area of the sky that had visible stars.   At some point around 11:30ish I noticed a bright orangish red ball flying above the the hills,  right above Mt. Hamilton.   I stared at it for almost a minute before I knew for sure that what I was looking at was something I could not understand.   It looked like a ball of light and it moved like an airplane at first.  I then pointed it out to my 2 friends,  and let them know that I had been staring at this and can't figure it out.  They immediately thought it was an airplane,  due to the size and speed.  But then it seemed to stop in mid air,  not to mention it wasn't really moving in a straight ! line.  So then we thought it was a helicopter.  This also was disproved by the size and speed.   I would say it was the size of a 3-4 bedroom house or slightly bigger.   So it moved toward us, and seemed pretty low, but then moved away,  then North,  then back to the West,  back North again before it looked to be moving away from us upward!  When it moved it was either really slow or extremely fast.  It shot up into space and disappeared within about 10 seconds!  This ball thing also seemed to be changing color from red to orange,  and I think I could see the colors moving all around the ball.  At a certain point I could see light radiating from the ball in all directions.  It looked like seeing a red light through a wet window,  or like how a bright star looks in the distance.   This lasted at least 2 minutes.   I was then walking around my yard going through every possible explanation,  and one of my friends was also doing this.  The 3rd friend was in denial and kept maki! ng up excuses as to what it was,  but non of them made sense a! nd I cou ld disprove all of them.   After a few minutes we sat back down and attempted to restart our conversation.  I however couldn't stop staring East.  Then, after about 2-3 minutes from the last occurrence,  I saw it again!  Except this time I saw it immediately,  as it rose above the East hills.   I started yelling for everyone to look at it,  and scared them because it made me jump up.  This time we all 3 saw it from start to finish.   The weird thing was that it took what seemed to be the same path as the 1st fire balls we saw.  A lot of discussion went on during this second one,  and all possible explanations were thrown out the door.  It was official,  what we were seeing defied all logic based on our knowledge and the available technology.   It was gone again,  after it shot off into space,  and we were all left staring up into the eastern sky wondering what the f@*k just happened.  Once again after a few minutes I spotted it again in almost the same spot.  The 3rd time we! were very big eyed and quiet just observing and inside freaking out.  After the 3rd occurrence I went inside the house and told my girlfriend to wake up and put her jacket on.  I had to have another witness, and someone to explain to me what was going on.   She came outside and we all told her what we saw.  By this time we were all climbing things to get a higher view,  and she thought we were nuts!  But just my luck it happened one last time.  The 4th time we saw it,  it seemed to get closer to us before it shot off into the horizon.  Also,  during the whole thing all of us saw several shooting stars each.  All of also can't remember ever seeing more than one shooting star ever in our lives,  from San Jose that is.   I got my 6ft. ladder out to get a better view,  thinking it would happen again.  What I saw over the top of my very tall fence,  on the very tops of the hills,  was some odd lights.  It looked like street lights but all the way on the top of the hills.  I've ! lived here 32 years,  and I consider myself a very observant p! erson. I've never in my life seen lights on top of these hills.  I pointed them out to everyone and mentioned they were not normally there.   Everyone thought they were lights from someone's house on the mountain,  but I knew there are no homes there.   No more strange balls of fire showed up so we went and sat back down.  About 5 minutes later,  I got up and climbed up my ladder again.  When I looked to the top of the mountains,  the lights we saw were gone!  Also,  today with the sun up I used my binoculars to get a good view of that area,  and there is nothing there...  I don't know what we saw.  But it wasn't an airplane,  helicopter, remotely operated device, wasn't a meteor, missile, rocket, weather balloon,  and took off into space.  WTF?",

They were 2 to 3 times the size of the reference stars visible that evening, and about twice as bright, coloring in, like stars, white/blue.  The 3 lights were moving independent of each other, though retaining a general left-to-right margin distance of approximately 3 1/2 to 4 inches thumb-to-finger distance at arms length (I\u2019m 5\u201910 1/2\u201d).  Each light &quot;moved quickly\u201d, which is to say that within this margin, these lights traveled the full distance in slightly-curved lines with tight, elevated/declined curves at the margins in about 1/2 second.  They did this sporadically about 5 times within the 30 seconds.  When not \u201cmoving quickly\u201d, they seemed to stay still, though there was some \u201cdrifting away\u201d in what appeared to be the same south by southeast direction. After witnessing this event, I rushed into the house to get the kids and the camera; by the time I returned (1 to 1-1/2 minutes later), the thick-blanket cloud cover moving in from the southwest had obscured the lights",

The two lights suddenly disappeared and within 10 seconds a single similar light appeared in the direction of magnetic north, slowly ascended in altitude before suddenly vanishing.  We were unable to see any further similar objects, though we continued searching the sky for approximately 30 minutes after we lost sight of the object. This is our secong New Year's experience, though the last year's experience was with a differnet light pattern and possible craft outline.

They asked if I held a dime at arms length if it would cover them.  I said yes they were quite a bit smaller than that. They told me someone from the Peoria, IL office would be calling me too.

He noticed what he described as a \"star\", but with the sun still out I told him it was probably Jupiter.  I ran into the house quickly for about a minute and then came back out.  He was still fixated on this object, so I looked up and found it difficult to locate.  When I did see it, I noticed a small, rather unremarkable point of light just lingering there so I thought nothing of it.  It was almost directly overhead, the light was constant, and the weather was clear. After another minute or perhaps less, my brother said it was moving so he ran to grab his binoculars.  I found it harder to locate this time as indeed it had changed its location.  It was moving approximately ENE across the sky, but not particularly quickly, more like drifting across.  Now I knew it wasn't Jupiter so I went to grab my spyglass.  I asked him if it might be the ISS or a satellite but he said no as he was looking through his binoculars.  He couldn't make out the actual details of the object as it was difficult to focus on it with cheap binoculars, much less the fact that it was drifting across the sky.  It appeared to be slowly drifting faster until it was no longer there!  It was still overhead at the moment of last sighting and then we couldn't locate it any more. I'm not sure what this could be, and I'm pretty sure there's an explanation.  I'm sort of a skeptic when it comes to UFO sightings but am open to the idea of government/military experiments or atmospheric phenomena as explanations for most of them.  For this particular sighting, neither of those make sense to me.  If anyone has more information, I'd love to know.",

The trail and object were the same color from what I could tell but you could see it was an odd shape or three separate objects (see above).  The object(s) was pretty big in size and the tail was fairly long. The location where I noticed it was around the border of the cities San Jose, Los Gatos, Campbell.  On US Highway 85 I was traveling on the north bound side of 85 but was actually going from Southeast to Northwest.  I first noticed the light either above or just to the left of highway 85.  I watched for as long as I could, glancing at traffic (making sure I don't get in a wreck).  I lost it before it could travel over the hills in Los Gatos/Saratoga.  Total time I saw it was probably around 5 seconds, maybe less. The object was high enough in the sky/atmosphere that if it were to land it would have done so in the Pacific Ocean.",

I was called by my girlfriend to go to the balcony facing North, she said that there were some strange aircraft hovering in the sky east of downtown. I head out to the balcony to see what she was talking about and yes in fact there were 3 white lights in a triangle formation hovering in the sky, motionless,   The sky was very clear absolutely no clouds very calm wind and there was some air traffic but more than usual for the airport nearby you could clearly see what were clearly planes or a helicopter these lights were not a conventional aircraft.  Of the three the one in the center was the largest and had the most distinct shape, that of a diamond.   At first it appeared to be one large craft but after looking at it for about 3-4 minutes the lights began to separate and move away from each other slowly at first, then in a blink of an eye they seemed to have traveled a good distance from each other.  They stayed at a relatively far distance from each other at this time and stayed in position from what seemed to be an expanded triangular formation.  At this point the lights went from whitish blue to flashing red, green, and blue.   Sometime after watching the lights sit in place for a while I heard a jet fly by south of the house I looked and did in fact see a jet, what was odd Is that this aircraft was at around the same distance away but I could hear it where as I could not hear the 3 strange objects when they moved.  Two more lights appeared after a while but these stayed closely together one was hovering over the other and to the side at a small distance almost like it was supervising over the object below it.  Some pictures and video was taken but the quality is not good the lights I observed can be seen but the shape is a bit distorted.  All the lights eventually began rising slowly straight up into the atmosphere and eventually disappeared. On a side note I did observe the house pets (cat and dog) acting very erratic, running around and specifically the dog running up my leg,  2 more dogs from some neighbors also began barking.",

On 5/13/14 at approximately 1600 hours I observed an object in San Jose, Ca, near highway 237.  The object was a sphere or orb, white and semi translucent. The object appeared no bigger than a soccer ball.  The shape was very clean, not distorted, a perfect orb or spherical shape. I first assumed the object to be a plastic bag or seagull but the object stopped in midair in what appeared to be 15 \u2013 25 mph winds heading South by South East.  The object was at an altitude higher than a six story building but lower than the aircraft taking off at the nearby San Jose Airport.  Several commercial aircraft, 2 or 3 mostly 737s were visible during this time. The object moved in an erratic behavior dropping 50 \u2013 60 ft and then climbing vertical another 50 \u2013 60 ft.  The object moved right to left in a 50 yard area and then suddenly headed south and vertical in an upward motion at a speed much faster than the surrounding aircraft, birds, or insects that I observed.  Another way to characterize the speed, I have worked closely with F-18 Hornets and have never seen them capable of travelling at this speed. I doubted my observation several times thinking it could be a plastic bag, a bird, a drone, an insect, or even a piece of flying pollen.  None of the above items match the flight characteristics that this odd craft showed as it seemed intelligently controlled, capable of stopping and moving about in any direction, at any speed despite the winds. There were no visible clouds, no light shining on the windows of the building that I observed the object through.  I have never seen anything like it. There was no visible propulsion system, jet intake, propellers, or anything that would indicate the power source this craft used to move about.  If I had not been staring where I was at that exact moment I never would have seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

My family with, my kids and their kids were out on our deck in East Hills, San Jose, CA (just below Mt. Hamilton).  My daughter was pointing out a large jet airliner traveling South from the North to our grandson, and she noticed way above the jet two objects traveling West from East that were moving very slowly together much that appeared to be much higher than the jetliner.   We all then looked from her pointing them out.  My first thought was balloons, but because they were moving so perfectly together (in sync) slowly and going against the wind and clouds.   The clouds were coming in from the North West going east.  Not sure if it was light reflecting off of them, but they appeared to have small arced wings, again most likely spheres?   We watched for about 15 minutes and then it just disappeared in some clouds.    My whole family saw them, and we can only say there were like nothing we've seen before in our area.    We do have a lot of jetliner activity over our area going from SF to LA (North to South). Spheres, commercial sub-orbitals, balloons, or small drones?  I do know that NORAD had two Russian jets that flew 50 miles outside CA coast, not long ago.    http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/3166571/posts",

This orb can barely be seen with the naked eye, but was an obvious object that had a ghost like appearance.  It was not glowing, let's make that clear;  it was a light orange color that blended into the dark sky..   As it moved it was like an upside down flame, floating ever so slightly leaving a ghost-like trail behind it..  It would stop a couple of times and would revert back to its original form; a sphere.  Gazing upon it, for about 3-5 minutes, it disappeared blending into the night sky, I tried to keep motionless and staring at it, but soon it vanished without a trace.  It was an eerie heart-beating event, I've never seen anything so astonishing in my life. I also want to point out, there were many aircraft in the sky, less than a dozen had been spotted during the time of 10:30PM-11:05PM.  They could have been military, but as it was a moon lit night so I couldn't be certain.",

      "story": "Diamond shaped object with white lights rotating in the middle as well as red, yellow, blue, orange lights flashing all over the object. In the mid-evening to late evening hours of July 5th, 2001, I witnessed an unconventional flying object defy the laws of gravity while parked on a private road located in San Jose, CA.  I was accompanied by a young adult female and as we conversed I observed a bright light, (flying in the sky) resembling a star moving from left to right.  I had witnessed this type of movement from these bright lights within the same vicinity before, and I started to turn my high beam lights on the object as I had done previously.   As the object moved to the left I would briefly turn the high beams on in my vehicle once, and when it would move to the right I would I would briefly turn the high beams on and off twice (or vice versa).  During this flight pattern, my companion was not happy about me showing attention to anything besides her, and was discouraging me from shining the lights towards the object.  This went on for a few moments when the bright lit object began to fly up and down as well as left to right.  When the object flew up (moved up or ascended) I would briefly turn my high beams on and off 3 times, when it flew down (moved down or descended) I would briefly turn my high beams on and off 4 times (or vice versa).  Also during this time, I observed a red light in the distance flying to left of my vehicle. I did not pay it too much attention as it could have been a plane.  Either before or after the lit object began to fly up and fly down my companion observed it as well and said \u201cOkay, now that thing is moving\u201d. I decided that we should get out of the vehicle to witness this bizarre flight pattern. As we stood at the front end of the vehicle, the lit object began to fly towards us at a high rate of speed. At this point the objects light must have reached us, (just like a mirror would reflect sunlight on a person\u2019s face in the daytime) because without saying a word to each other, we simultaneously took a few stuttering steps towards the veh! icle doors in a hurried manner. We looked at each other briefl! y and I mentioned to her \u201cLet\u2019s get the F\u2014k out of here\u201d! We entered into the vehicle and I drove us out of there in an extreme hurry at high rate of speed. On our way out I had calmed down realizing that whatever we witnessed was not in pursuit of our vehicle. Being a young adult male, I decided that it was safe for us to pull over and continue what we set out to do when we parked in this area. At that time, my companion reclined her seat so that she could not look out the front passenger window. I was leaning over the middle console conversing with her when I observed another object (possibly the same object I shined my light at) appear just over the hillside approximately 50 yards away. If I had to estimate I would say it was  100 yards above ground. At this moment, numerous yellow, red, white and green lights appeared on the object and were flashing on and off with a row of white lights spinning around the middle of the object. I could hear rapid clicking sounds as well. At this! point the object ascended  approximately 50 yards higher (its highest point was approximately 150 yard above ground) than its original position and then descended approximately 100 yards down to a position of approximately 50 yards above ground. It flew up and down twice before going back to its original position at a 100 yards. It did this in approximately 1 second and proceeded to fly to the right at a slow pace. I could not believe my eyes. I felt as though this was something I should not be witnessing, the equivalence of taking a man before the wheel was invented, and placing him in the middle of a highway with nothing but 18-wheel rigs driving by him with lights all over each rig!  We would experience the same feelings with the same expression on our face! I find it ironic that I was not terrified at what I was witnessing, just shocked and amazed. The object repeated the flight pattern three times, but with the last it ascended once and descended once. Just before the! 3rd pattern my companion said to me \u201cOh god, not this again\u201d.! I repli ed for her to \u201dLook\u201d, (I was in such shock I could not speak at first), she answered \u201cOh god\u201d. I got frustrated and impatient and yelled \u201cF----ing Look\u201d! Just as she began sitting to an upright position and looking to her right, the object flew out of view behind a hillside. I witnessed an object in flight that I will forever question and she missed it! I didn\u2019t even have a witness although I was with another person. Sometimes I wonder why didn\u2019t she hear the initial clicking from the lights, or maybe a reflection of the object anywhere. Now, whenever I am outside at night I will look to the sky\u2019s for anything unusual. I often think about that object, what was it, who flew it, where did it come from, who owns it because something has to, where was it manufactured, does it have a monetary value like a car, and where is it now? Is it in a hangar somewhere, a garage or is it destroyed on some desolate planet?  Or maybe, it\u2019s occupants are awaiting the rapture so that they can re! veal their role in Human history with lie\u2019s spewing from their mouth. Whatever the case, there is definitely a higher intelligence far beyond our own and our government must have some kind of information that could shed some light on this controversial topic. It is even possible government officials were piloting the object and had a great laugh at my expense. This account is real and there is definitely something of another intelligence other than ourselves in this universe. I have never heard of any other accounts similar to mine and the only thing close to it is from a John Lennon song of a UFO he witnessed while in a NY hotel room. If needed I could provide pictures of the vicinity where the second encounter took place. Also I would be willing to make a composite drawing of the object if needed. I am very interested in knowning of any other accounts such as mine and hope I am not disregarded.",

Then all of a sudden we hear coming up from behind us (right about where San Jose Airport is) a helicopter.  He went over our heads and straight for the middle of the two bright lights. To our disbelief, he took his place in between these two bright red blinking lights and now there are 4 perfectly spaced bright stars blinking red.  Right now as I'm writing this, a helicopter just flew over the house back towards San Jose Airport.  All I can say is they must be doing some kind of training or exercise ....

I have been seeing these for weeks now and I know they are not stars, planes or satellites. They hover around in the night skies and some are higher up an some come as close to the ground as flying in between taller trees.  Most of them kind of flash a color that looks likes red, white, and blue at the same time (instantaneously) some of them are a lot more active, almost as if they are patrolling areas.  I can't describe the shape because they seem to shift and some of them blink just red.  As weird as it sounds, I feel like they can tell when you stare at them and when you pay attention to one or two for a long enough time and then turn around there is almost always another new one that pops up in sight that you can tell was observing you when you were paying attention to the other one(s).  There are also more circularish ones and square ones too with multiple lights.  These are the ones that cruise closer to the ground in an almost sneaky manor.  The ones highe! r up almost look like a fleet. As hard as it may be for some to believe, these things are really out there and if they were something easily explainable like planes or satellites believe me I would not keep ending up trying to follow them around and observing them with such interest.  I don't know about you but I grew up on one twinkle little star that stayed put and not tens and tens of them that move around and react to my actions.  My stars never hid hovering behind big trees and buildings in different colors, fly to different  locations, and react to some of my movements(chasing or walking away).  These objects seen to be very small by the way too.  Can anyone else relate to anything I just said in this giant paragraph??

      "story": "Multiple glowing objects in the sky photographed within two minutes. I was at the Diridon transit station in San Jose, California, waiting for my train on my way to work.  Diridon station is a busy station, in an urban setting with lots of city noise and bustle.  I decided to take some pictures of cheery tree blossoms.  The time was 12:13 p.m.  I took two photographs of the blossoms and then noticed a security mirror on a pole that was reflecting the trees and the rail tracks and I thought it would make a nice picture so I positioned myself to photograph that as well.  I snapped one photo, glanced at it and decided to take another.  The second one is slightly closer to the mirror and more centered.  The two photos were taken at 12:14 and 12:15, respectively.  Both photos show three lamp posts on the right. I sat down on a bench in the shade to review the photos.  In the one taken at 12:15 I noticed a white shape above the lamp post in the foreground.  Wondering what it was, I zoomed in and was amazed to find I had captured an object in the sky that was the shape of a flat half-circle and appeared to have a light emission or vapor trail surrounding it.  I'm convinced I managed to photograph a UFO. I did not actually see the craft in real time, as I was focusing on photographing the mirror.  I did not hear anything that led me to look at it, either.  There are airplane flying in the area as this transit station is not far from the airport; however, the flight path is in the opposite direction of the photographed object. This morning I was reviewing the photos and zooming on each of them and have seen in both photos of the cherry blossoms that there are glowing objects, lines and discs in the sky.  In total there are 5-7 between the three photos. I am a 42-year-old female, mother of two and I work at the public library as a circulation clerk.  I have also sent a photo via email.",

He answered no, if it was an airplane it appears it would be falling. It began to get slightly brighter and continued moving slowly.  Too slow to be an airplane, or helicopter, completely silent and nothing like we've both ever seen before.   My friend noted a triangular shape.   This  lasted a total of maybe three minutes.  Then, it began to get dimmer in brightness.  Then within a 5-10 second time span, it began to appear to blink, getting smaller and then completely disappeared.

It was also hard to tell the shape even looking through the binoculars.   One of my pictures shows a perfectly round orb and yet they also seemed to be on fire.

I was in my hot tub just looking at the stars and there appeared a round red fiery light with red flame-like flares coming from the sides of the UFO.  It was traveling in a straight line from the West going East.  It was the most spectacular thing I have ever seen in the sky.  As I watched it travel across the sky, I was wishing I had my camera. To my great surprise, right before the UFO disappeared, another UFO came into view following the same path as the first one.  It was exactly the same, flying the same speed and everything.  I yelled louder and louder for my wife to come outside.  She came outside half dressed to see what I was yelling about.  She saw the UFO and was greatly amazed also. She went back into the house and got her camera and started taking shots of the UFO\u2019s.  I went into the house also and got my camera so I could try and get some shots.  I was able to shoot about 50 shots but only some came out.  I do have some interesting shots even if they are not great.  My wife took about 10 shots and some of hers came out good also. It was very amazing because the UFO\u2019s kept on coming out of the West.  As soon as one got about three-quarter of the way across the sky another one would show up.  There were a total of 9 or 10 UFO\u2019s that flew over my house.  At one point it appeared that one of the UFO\u2019s stopped and the other one that was following started catching up.  One of the craft appeared to be higher in the sky as they got closer to each other.  The closes they got together was about the distance of two moons apart, then they move on and disappeared.  At one time I could see three UFO\u2019s all in a row traveling the same path then one would wink out and the the next one would disappear and so on.  It seems some of the craft had different spacing that others.  They were not all the same distance apart as they traveled across the sky. This happened between 8:30 PM and 9:00 PM on Sunday February 1, 2015, above San Jose, California 95111 USA.  In general the UFO\u2019s were a round shape.  The craft was round and the red fiery like flames were toward the front on both sides and also toward the rear on both sides.   The UFO\u2019s came out of the West (Pacific Ocean), they were traveling almost due East (East Coast)  The first 5 or 6 UFO\u2019s all had a \u201chalo\u201d of red-flame-like-flares coming from the front sides of and the rear sides of the round body of the craft.  All craft followed the same course West to East and also about the same path (a straight line across the sky)  There were no commercial planes in the sky that I could see during this time  The moon was very bright it seemed I almost needed sunglasses  The red glow of the craft got brighter as they came from the West and when they were three-quarters of the way across the sky they were the brightest. When they passed the three-quarters mark they started losing their glow and soon winked out and were gone. It seem they all disappeared in about the same part of the sky My photos were taken with a Nikon D800 with AF-S Nikkor 23-120 mm 1:4 G ED lens about 50 photos  My wife\u2019s photos were taken with a Nikon Coolpix P510 Nikkor 42X Wide Optical Zoom ED V 4.3 - 180mm 1:3-5.9 lens   The craft had different distances between them  As I looked to the South the crafts were traveling West to East below Orion\u2019s Belt and below the moon\u2019s position in the sky I will submit Photos as soon as I figure out how (on February 4th, 2015)",

The white light shining down went out from the point of light at an angle towards the ground and it expanded out in a very distinct come shape that had very clear edges to it. In the center of the cone of white light was a green stripe of light that glowed like radium and nearly the same color. The point of light emitted no sound and was traveling upwards from the earth.

My son originally spotted the object. My wife got a couple of good photos. The object appeared to e emit a cone-shaped plume of white illuminated material. There also appeared to be a lingering green beam of light behind the object. The green beam appeared to be about as wide as the full moon and very straight and consistent in its pale green color. The green beam persisted for several minutes and appeared to stretch toward the horizon behind the object. The white plume appeared to be illuminated and appeared to grow as the object proceeded toward the west/northwest in a straight line. After watching the objects and plume for more about a minute the plume suddenly cut off and the object continued to move ahead in a straight line. The plume expanded behind the object and appeared to be approximately 5+ degrees in width. One other witness and I continued to watch the object move toward the western horizon.

As planes do use that corridor fairly regularly, I paused to watch as it was very bright.  There were no flashing lights or sounds of an aircraft.  It appeared that there were two white lights in close proximity to each other, such as would be found on an airliner.  The object moved somewhat slowly and I guessed it was about 4-6 miles away.  After about 20 seconds, what looked like a spotlight from the object aimed at an approx. 200\u00ba down and to my left.  I then thought that it must be SJPD\u2019s helicopter.  The \u201cspotlight\u201d continued for about 30 seconds and I wonder why it remained in the clouds/fog instead of dropping to get a clearer view of the subject.  It was not a helicopter as far as I could tell.  I then looked around the sky and realized there were no other clouds or any fog.! The \u201cspotlight\u201d was in fact a trail of smoke/vapor, etc., and it was about 20\u00ba long and continued into a much larger marshmallow-shaped cloud.  I could still see the light as it continued on and seemed to curve slightly upward to the west and away from me before disappearing.  The event lasted about 2 minutes.  The \u201cspotlight\u201d part of the cloud remained for about 15 minutes, glowing bluish-white.  The moving light itself faded after about 7 minutes.

I managed to get two pics and zooming in there are bout three objects of bright light and it makes an L shape of some kind. I know that wasnt a plane.  I have a telescope and i have never seen a star or light, that bright in the sky. No noise so it was not a helicopter.  Made me get the chills honestly and i dont freak out easily.

      "story": "This event was actually two related sightings on the same night at locations that were within 10 minutes of each other. The first sighting occurred at approximately 10:35 pm on Monday, 12/14/2015.  I was driving my car, turning right onto Cropley Ave. from Conifer Ln. in San Jose, CA.  As I looked left to make sure there was no oncoming traffic, I noticed quite a bright \"star\" streaking toward the easterly direction.  It lasted less than two seconds, tracing across perhaps a fifth of the sky. My first reaction was that I had seen a meteor.  But the object wasdefinitely a small round disc (like a golf ball seen at about 30 feet away).  The luminosity was similar to that of an LED light and, although moving rather fast, it did not exhibit a \"tail\" as the natural light from a meteor would do.  As I made the turn and continued to drive, I really didn't think anything more about it. My drive proceeded southwesterly along Cropley to Morrill Ave., turning right on Morrill to get to Landess Ave., where I then turned left.  Landess heads roughly westward and turns into Montague Expressway after the Highway 680 overcrossing.  I proceded southwestward down Montague, crossing over Highway 880, until I stopped at a red light at either Zanker Rd. or N. 1st St. (I'm not sure which one.)  The time was approximately 10:45 pm and it was here that I saw the golf-ball object again while looking up to the left through the windshield at about a 40 to 45 degree angle.  Instead of streaking as it did before, it made a sort of randomly \"hilly\" curve in the sky that lasted about as long as the first sighting. I was rather surprised, however, to see that (in the background sky of the golf-ball object) there were (I believe) eight lights of much lesser intensity than the golf-ball.  Each light was (as best I can describe it) shaped kind of like a flattened diamond. The most noticeable feature of these lights, to me, was that they were divided into two rows of four lights each, one row below the other by perhaps 5 to 10 degrees, from my vantage point.  Each row's lights were evenly spaced, and the bottom row's lights were aligned directly below the top row's.  The lights alternately dimmed and intensified, in unison, with a period of perhaps two to three seconds. As I stared at the configuration, I thought it might be due to an optical artifact of the area's street lights reflecting on my windshield.  But I rolled down my window and stuck my head outside to look; they were still there. It also occurred to me that there could be Christmas lights on the top edge of a nearby building.  I wouldn't be able to see the building because it was night and the brighter street lights would interfere with any ambient backlighting behind the dark building.  However, at the angle and direction I was looking (~ 45 degrees up, southward), no buildings are that tall when one takes into account the distance between my stopped car at the intersection, and any building to the south. Finally, the lights could not lie on a possible power line because both rows were arranged absolutely ruler straight, whereas there would likely be a slight bow in the arrangement if attached to a power line (due to line sag). The whole sighting at the stopped light on Montague probably lasted about 15 to 20 seconds.  Just before my traffic light turned green, there were (I believe) three other cars at the intersection: one next to me on the right, one in the opposite direction that was beginning a turn northward onto the cross street, and one waiting on my left on the cross street, at his red light.  I looked to see if I could detect any awareness of the unidentified lights by the person on my right, but it was difficult to see the driver inside the car.  It seemed as if no one else noticed. The sighting was over when each row of lights split in half, two lights accelerating to the right, two accelerating to the left.  The intensity of the lights quickly dimmed to zero as their speed increased, and they never deviated from their ruler straight horizontal paths.

      "story": "UFO flies over city before flashing, witnessed on a mountain. I was sitting on top of Mt. Umunhum with two of my friends.  We were smoking a cigarette when I noticed that slightly over a mountain to my left there was a red orbish looking craft moving similarly to a bumblebee, jolting back as it moved left.  After about 30 seconds of this the craft paused, then started slightly ascending and moving to the right.  It was still redish orange at this point.  About this time the people I was with saw how oddly it was moving.  It started ascending higher and higher before moving to where it was centered from out perspective to the city.   At this point it had gone from more red to slightly more orange and had quick flashes of blue. As it moved over the city the flight patterned changed from a jolty flowing pattern to soaring through the sky above the city until it just stopped.  Once it stopped it alternated between red, orange, blue, and white before flashing what I could describe as an almost yellow light.  The shape seemed to have! changed as well going from a distinct orb to a diamond.  The light being emitted was the shape of a diamond with a gap through the center of the diamond.  It did this for about 30 second or so before going back to a red orb and flying west away.  Being terrified me and my 2 friends were trying to figure out what we just saw for about 10 minutes.  Then around 1 AM, the craft hovers over the mountain northwest from us and starts flying distinctly in our direction, very confidently.  As it got closer I looked away for a second before I hear \"it disappeared\".  At this point we said 'we have to leave now', and as we drive down the mountain I see it once more just floating in the sky.  It was white with an orange tint around the edge of emitted light.  I've never been more terrified or more interested in something in my life.",

When I spotted this thing I knew it was not a plane I am the manager at the apartments I live at and have access to all the lighting so I went around and shut off all the lights on the grounds to see this thing better when I looked up it had barely moved.  Then I flipped it off and began flashing my led flashlight at it thinking it was a drone that the county uses.   At around 3 am a tenant came and asked what is going on I told him and he grabbed a pair of binoculars remembering that I had a pair too I did the same  He said he had seen this before, and it was a satellite.  When looking at it through the lenses it moved up and down and side to side quickly it was hard to keep it in the lenses when looking at it with the naked eye it just seems to hover in one place when I told this guy that he laughed and said yea they are a trip and he left.   Well, I just looked out my front door and it is still there at 4:36 am pst it is not saucer shape it is more oblong when looking at it through the lenses it changes it is a ball of fire then just a light that seems to have two parts at times.  Anyway, I'm off to see if I can get more people to see it so there is better proof if you need it.  I called the news room at ktvu and have not heard anything so maybe its nothing.  Oh, I got four other people to look they said it was unusual too.  thank you",

I\u2019m a star gazer.  So I can tell the difference between stars, planets, satellites and so forth.  I saw what looked to be one of the closer planets, but the light was not right.  It kind of looked like multiple lights clustered closely together.  That is what caught my eye initially. While looking at that, I noticed 2 fainter lights (about as bright as a far away star) appeared to be moving relative to the bright light.  Meaning the spacing between the 3 was varying.  The 3 lights were slowly moving from the South-West sky to the North-West.  All the while the 2 fainter lights kept changing their proximity to the bright light. At this point I went inside to grab my binoculars to get a better look. It was obvious their altitude was very high.  I actually thought this might be the International Space Station, but the other 2 lights made that not likely, and they were moving to slow.  While viewing the 3 lights thru the binoculars, one of the 2 fainter lights, started moving straight down at a much faster rate than they were moving across.  I lost sight of it as it moved below the roof line of my house. The other 2 continued on their original path and I lost them in the clouds a minute later.  Speaking of clouds, there was a scattering of clouds.  The 2 remaining lights were at about 310 deg NW, when I lost them.",

I don't know how to describe the speed, but it flew faster in the sky than the driving car.   After 10-15 seconds, it disappeared.  I still cannot give a direct answer what that really was.  Maybe it really was a UFO, or just an aircraft flying at very high speed and then hiding through the clouds.",

Some movement in the sky caught my eye and upon focusing I found I was watching an unlit object cruising through the sky northward. The object banked slightly and I was able to make out a triangular shape.  The object made no noise that I noticed and had no lighting on the bottom or sides. (or at all)  The light pollution in the sky provided decent contrast with which to view the object.  It moved quickly through the sky and was only visible for approximately 10 seconds.  The object was moving substantially faster than any other aircraft I've seen to date.  It appeared to be much higher in altitude than most other aircraft as well.  (my viewing position was nearby an airport)  Being close to the airport, I commonly see all manner of aircraft which is precisely why this one stood out enough to make this report.  The speed of the object could be likened to a satellite transiting overhead.",

I was visiting McDonald's restaurant last night on Blossom Hill Rd. and Kooser Ave. while sitting in my car in the parking lot with the window open I started hearing a noise that sounded like someone dragging a big bag of rocks across the sidewalk very slowly. as I exited my vehicle I looked up above my head into the night sky.  I saw 3 distinct small red lights in triangular formation that were blinking together but not always consistent.  This area above my head in the sky always has heavy commercial airline traffic.  The lights traveled in such a consistent orientation that it led me to believe that this was 1 craft, and not 3 separate crafts.  The speed of this craft was very slow.  I observed that this craft was also well under the elevation of the airport traffic itself.  I have seen planes land and take off at night and day and am familiar with the mass silhouette of area that the wings and fuselage cover. this craft by comparison was maybe 9 to 10 times the size of a full moon in the night sky. as it passed over my head I was trying to determine the shape of this craft.  I did not see any defining edges to this craft no matter where I looked for it.  It is as if the lights were visible but not the craft.  The best way to describe what I saw while looking for defining edges was that this craft appeared to me to be cloaked. showing 3 lights in triangular formation that were on a craft that was cloaked from my view.",
