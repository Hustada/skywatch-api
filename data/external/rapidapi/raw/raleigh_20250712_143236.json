      "story": "Large Triangle object in sky over North Carolina This night in question takes place years ago.  I don\u2019t even know the date, but it must have been from say early October, or until the end of march.  The reason I say this, is because my best friend and I had gone to watch NC State play basketball.  So it was definitely during basketball season.  The year was 1985, or 1986.   The only reason I\u2019m reporting it, is because I see others who have seen similar objects.  I\u2019ve (We\u2019ve) kept it to ourselves all these years.  Oh, we have mentioned it to a few people, but you can imagine what kind of ribbing we took. Anyway, it was after the ball game, and that would have been between 9 and 12 pm depending on what time the game was.  I really don\u2019t remember if it was a 7:00 game or an 9:00 game.   We were on our way back home on 50 highway from Raleigh towards Benson.   We were driving in a small pickup when we noticed a huge black object to our left.  It was really low, if I had to guess, I would say maybe 600 feet or less.  I would guess the object to be at least as long as a football field.     We pulled over and both of us opened our doors, got out, and looked up as this huge triangular object passed over us.  It was solid black, with no discernable lights except for the very tip of the triangle.  The other thing worth mentioning, is that it was slowly rotating as it moved.   Well we stood there and watched this object move from the left to directly overhead moving to the right of us.  Since we were on 50 south, that would have been East to West.   As we looked up, we were both in awe.  It made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  Completely silent.  I think that was the eeriest part of the whole thing.  How could something that huge fly the way it was flying, and make not a bit of sound.   We tried to follow it somewhat, but because it was so low to the ground, it was out of sight in less than 2 minutes. Gone behind the treeline. We\u2019ve often discussed it between ourselves, but not made too many waves.  We never heard anything else, and we figured something that big would have had to be seen and reported by other people.  I know what I saw, and I\u2019ve watched a lot of shows about our military, and never never have seen an aircraft like what I just described.  I\u2019m pretty sure the stealth was not out at that time, but even if it was, it did not fly in the manner with which I witnessed that night.   My main reason for posting this, was to see maybe, just maybe someone else saw the same thing my friend and I did, and about that same time frame.  It would validate my experience somewhat and verify that I was not crazy!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I saw an incredibly bright, white, flashing light above the trees ahead of the road. It flashed about every 4 seconds, very regularly, I could tell because it was flashing to the beat of the song I was listening to. It was the size of a pin head when I first noticed it and it was a bit too high to be a tower, or any kind and I was too far out in the country for any houses to be around, there are no light poles or even power lines along that road. I know this area pretty well, I live just a few miles away and I drive on that road all the time, I have never seen anything like that out there before. As I drove closer I went around a few turns and it was now on the right side of my car, it got a lot bigger and a lot brighter very quickly. At the biggest, I saw it through the trees, it was almost the size of the moon and it was bright, when I looked at the center it was so bright it blinded my vision, the center looked multicolored or black it was so bright. I do not think it ever moved but I cannot be sure. I have never seen anything up in the air that bright, that big and not moving. When I could not see it I could tell it was there because it kind of lit up the area. \tWhen I got to highway 98 I turned west back to my house. I could not see the light once I got onto 98, I drove down hill and the light was behind and to the right of me.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw what I thought was a hawk floating over my house. After a second or two I realized it had too many wings to be a hawk. It was more of a star shape with about six points, dark against the bright blue December sky.  My next guesses of a very large leaf or (hah!) a flying squirrel were ruled out by the altitude of the object. I guessed it was flying at over 1000 feet.  It cruised silently from almost directly west to east, at roughly 120 to 150 knots at my estimated altitude. As it approached the trees on the eastern horizon, I could no longer make out the points of the star. It now appeared more like a ball.  Perhaps unrelated to this, a helicopter (which I took to be military from the sound) followed the same course (and apparent altitude) exactly ten minutes later.  Earlier today I was taking pictures of hawks and so had my telephoto camera within 20 feet of me but had no time to take a picture of the object.  The object may have been a very large balloon, though I haven't seen many star-shaped balloons of this sort. It flew in the direction of the wind. It made no sudden turns or other unusual movements, nor did it make any sound.",

I kept seeing the lights too frequently for them to be search lights or even the giant spot lights used sometimes when a car dealership is having a big sale. When I got to my exit, I pulled off to the side of the road and exited my car. I saw 4 large white lights going around in circles. They would meet in the center and spread quickly back out again. I guess I stood out there about 5 or 10 minutes just looking up in wonder and amazement. I am female, and as cars came up the exit, not one stopped to see why I was standing by the side of the road, looking up and pointing at the sky. I called my sister who works at Wal-Mart third shift, just a few miles away and told her something was going in the sky and described what I saw. When I got to Wal-Mart, I went in and got my sister and one of her co-workers to come outside and look at the sky. They were also witnesses to the lights. As one lady was leaving the store, I pointed to the sky and told her to look at the sky. Her reaction was, \"Oh, my God.\"  As long as I live I will never forget what I saw last night. NEVER!

I have always loved spotting planes and trying to identify them and have read many books on aircraft. At about 11am in bright clear sunshine I was driving roughly westward on the Raleigh Inner beltline when I saw directly in front of me what obviously was an airliner flying at low speed. It was at very low altitude and seemed about 2 or 3 miles away flying above the trees and straight across my path. I stared at it for maybe 2 seconds. It was a long slim cylinder of shiny metal with two colored sections-one red and one black each about 1/4 of the length of the craft. I saw no wings, tail section or engines but assumed this was due to looking from the side of the plane and maybe some subtle reflection of sunlight was hiding the tail. Also, since it is extremely common to see aircraft approaching nearby Raleigh/Durham International Airport, I had instantly dismissed it as an airliner and looked slightly away from it to maintain my lane position but glanced right back within about 1 second to confirm what type of plane it was. Within that one second it had vanished. I blinked my eyes repeatedly like people do in the movies... but due to the craft's low speed and relatively wide sighting area I had in front of me I would have had to look away for at least 5 or 6 seconds to miss it going behind trees and buildings in the distance. This event did not conform to any rational explanation I can think of other than that it was an extremely advanced technology and either departed or became invisible instantaneously.",

As I neared the bridge over Wade Ave., the lights got closer and closer until a triangle shaped craft passed slowy overhead. It had two white lights at the narrow end of the equilateral triangle and two on the broad end, with a smaller blinking red light in the middle. The craft passed over head with no noise whatsoever and continued in the opposite direction. It was about 300 feet over tree top level, and appeared to be the about twice the size of my car. Had I heard engine noise, I would have thought from the shape that it was fighter jet of some kind.",

      "story": "2 objects that looked like bright stars moving in parallel about 45 degrees above the horizon There were 2 objects moving in parallel that each looked like a bright star.  The moon was bright and there was some high altitude haze in the atmosphere, so most stars were barely visible at the time.  At first glance this looked like 2 stars, but then I noticed they were moving slowly.  They appeared to be at very high altitude, maybe 40K feet.  The moved due East in parallel to each other for about 10 seconds.  Then they faded away gradually over a ~5 second period.   I estimate the lights were about 45 degrees above the horizon. There are no major airports due East of Raleigh, but there are military bases East of here.  These lights did not have the typical strobes flashing that is common on commercial aircraft.   Most high altitude air traffic over Raleigh is running North-South up the East coast of the country.  Given the lack of strobes on what I observed, I'm confident these were not commercial aircraft. The only plausible explanation would be military aircraft.  Military aircraft can run without lights.  But do they have bright lights to illuminate them like a star?  These objects were bright and no strobes were present.  The looked like bright stars or a planet would look, such as Venus.  Given that they appeared to be at high altitude, they would not have been flying in close military formation.  I would estimate the distance between these 2 objects would have been over a mile if they were at 40K feet.  Given that they were well above the horizon and the lights faded relatively quickly (~5 seconds), it's not consistent with an aircraft slowing flying out of sight over the horizon.  I have no explanation. Also, high altitude commercial air traffic was leaving vapor trails in the atmosphere on this night, visible by the moonlight.  These objects left no vapor trail.

At first I thought it might be a passenger jet's landing lights (as seen from head-on) since we live only a few miles from RDU, but after watching it for about 30 seconds, we realized it could not be a plane because it wasn't moving.  A car was coming up behind me on the street, so we continued on our way to our destination. It takes about 5 minutes to get out of our neighborhood and onto I-540 (the outer loop around Raleigh).  As we were pulling onto 540, we again saw the light(s) ahead of us.  As we got closer, we could start making out the details better.  There were red lights on either side of the 'craft', and white lights in the middle.  540 is a very busy road on Saturday evenings, and as we were getting really close to this object, all of the cars in front of us were slowing down to look at it as well.  It was hovering just above the trees at the intersection of Six Forks Road and 540.  It looked like a \"V\" with large white lights in the center and down both \"wings\" with the red lights on the tips of the wings.  It looked to be about the size of a passenger jet, but again it was not moving.  I wanted to get out and take photos with my phone, but we were running late for our event and my wife didn't want me to stop. Anyway, I'm just hoping that maybe someone else took the time to report this as well as I know many, many people saw this.  Maybe someone can check with air traffic at RDU as it must have been on their radar. It was not a plane, nor was it a helicopter (much too big).  It's worth noting that it was not there when we returned home 4 hours later.",

It was almost like they were floating as they were moving, their movement was very fluid. Once we realized what they were, they were gone.  They disappeared extremely fast.

While traveling in a car, approximately 1 mile north of the 401/55 intersection, traveling north on Rt 401, two white lights where spotted in the dark evening sky, to the east of a tower with red blinking lights in the vicinity of Ten-Ten road, but the craft was an unknown distance north of the tower.  Lights were originally believed to be that of a military transport on approach to Fort Bragg/Pope Army Airfield, until it was noticed that the craft did not have any blinking navigational aircraft lights.  Observer lost visual contact when traveling in the low spot south of 401/Ten-Ten Road intersection. While waiting for the traffic signal to change at the 401/Ten-Ten Road intersection, the two craft lights were noticed moving east toward the Clayton radio/TV towers, one behind the other, parallel to the ground.   The two white lights appeared to be moving as part of one object and maintained a uniform distance during travel.  Rate of movement was faster than a helicopter.  Object was traveling approximately 20-25 degrees above the horizon. Observer spotted craft a third time after passing Wake Tech campus on 401.  Craft appeared to be making a sweeping flat turn, full circle, back toward south Raleigh, approaching from the south.   Observer lost visual at approximately the intersection of 401/Ransdell Road. Observer spotted the craft a fourth time while traveling in the vicinity of Phillips Farm.  Craft appeared to be banking (left light was higher than the right light), lined up for flight over Garner/Raleigh moving at an accelerating speed to points north.  Observer lost visual due to trees at the top of the hill north of the Phillips Farm. By the time the observer made it to the intersection of 401/Old Stage Road the craft was no longer visible.  Observer was unable to determine if he was looking at one craft with two lights, or two crafts with one light each.  Brightness of the craft lights did not appear to change during the course of the observations and always appeared to point out from the craft, even when accelerating away to the north.  Lights were not observed pointing toward the ground.  No noise was heard.  Observation period from first sighting to last sighting was approximately 20 minutes.",

For 12 years I have been a network engineer for one of the largest communications companies on the planet.   At this time, I was working in the FAANMC for the FAA under MCI before Verizon had bought us out and the FAANMC contract went to Harris.  We provided communications for the Federal Aviation Administration and managed their network.   I had never seen anything before, and still do not know what I did see.  I was driving home from work, I worked 3 pm until 11pm and my days worked rotated.   I was exiting on Wade Ave from I40 East, and as I drove towards the RBC Center I saw it.  I had my 2006 F150 Lariat\u2019s windows and sun roof open.  Normally when I get on Wade, I take the next exit Edwards Mill Rd to get home.   But right before I got there I looked up and saw a glowing greenish triangle aircraft fly over the RBC center at a high rate of speed then stopped.   I hit my brakes as we as the other few cars around me as it hovered for a bit.  It then made a lateral movement with no sound and took off back towards the direction it came so fast I could not follow it with my eyes.   I started getting out of my truck but just drove home and convinced myself it was nothing.   I have not spoken of it since now but I thought it may help someone out there or I know what we saw that night.   I know the military choppers are always doing maneuvers in that area, I just wish I knew what really happened and what it is was.   I have seen a lot of aircraft and know what they should be able to do and this should not have been able to have been completed.  The stop, acceleration and speed were like nothing I have ever seen.   Best of luck to all, I hope this helps. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",

As we were leaving to come home, I saw 25-30 circular lights in the sky overhead.  Instantaneously, and only for a second, I thought there must be some type of fireworks show going on.  However, the lights did not disappear.  At this point, I did not believe there was anything other-worldly about them (I just thought it was unusual and I wanted to see what these things were).  I pulled the car into the nearest stop (a Hess gas station).  My 2 children and I got out of the car and saw what now only seemed to be about 10 -15 fireballs in the sky directly over our head.  I knew then that this was something spectacular as these fireballs seem to move deliberately in pairs of two or three and at a very slow pace.  They emitted no sound, but they definitely moved in patterns that were not random and there was an ebb and flow to their movement.  Again, all these fireballs see! med to be grouped together in packs of 2 or 3 and seemed to be interacting with one another.  As they went over our head, they seemed to suddenly disappear.  By the time I got my I-phone out to take a video, only a couple remained in the sky.  I will send that video to you so you can get an idea of their movement, but unfortunately they appear smaller in the video than what we saw with our own eyes.  The entire sighting took less than 5 minutes, and by the end of the 5 minutes, both my children were very scared.  I was not (in fact, I felt incredibly blessed to have witnessed something I believed was very special), but we quickly got back in the car and headed home as I did not want to unnecessarily frighten my children. I watched the news that night looking for a report on what I saw (I even suspected there might be some breaking news on it as this was over downtown Raleigh, a very public place).  However, there was no mention of it.  I even e-mailed my video to the local weather guy (a friend of mine), but he did not comment on it.  I just let it go until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM tell the listeners to report something even it is was several years ago.  So that is what I am doing here.  Again, I will also send that video to you right now.",

My girlfriend says we were travelling East on Millbrook Road towards Millbrook Collection, which is a shopping center, located at the corner of Millbrook Rd./Atlantic Ave. My girlfriend was driving and since I'm still quite new to the area, I was looking around and noticed, what I believed to be chem-trails, which were all intersecting in one spot in the sky, similar to the shape of an asterisk. Just west of this formation, in the sky, was an airplane which left an extremely long plume of white vapor. In the same area as this plane, was a solid black object, sort of, cylindrical-shaped, with some kind of blurry feature on it. Both the plane and the black object appeared very high. I'm guessing that that plane was at crusing altitude, so what's that, 30,000+ feet?  Well, it appeared that the black object was at least that high. At arms length, the object was about the size of a pencil's eraser. If this object was indeed around the same height as the plane, it must have been 1/4 size in comparison to it. The distance from the object to the plane appeared to be 300-400 yards.  The object made no noise. At first, I thought it was a bird, but it didn't move. I observed this for at least a mile, still in the same spot. At some point, the trees got in my view and i was unable to see it. Once past the trees, I looked and the plane was still there but the black object was gone. I didn't see it again. I've made several reports on this site over the years.  This is the first UFO I've seen and reported in the Raleigh, NC area.  The others were all seen by me and other witnesses in and around the Charlotte, NC area.",

At approx 8:45 on the night of 4/9/2012 I was letting my dogs outside for their last bathroom trip for the night when I looked up in the sky and saw a bright light in the south eastern part of the sky. The light was extremely bright and moved at a high rate of speed.  What got my attention was that there was no sound and there were absolutely no flashing lights of any kind. I called for my fiance to come and see, she also noted that there were no flashing lights and that it just did not move like a plane because of the high rate of steady speed. As it moved from the south east it increased its brightness by 50% then made a very sharp turn towards due east at about a 60' to 70' degree angle then as its brightness decreased we could see 2 smaller objects, 1 ejected from each side of the object, 1 going north and 1 going south at the exact same speed.  The objects that came out of the side of the light/object moved so fast they were gone as soon as they came ou! t. The object then gave off one last bright burst then I lost sight of it over my neighbors roof. Never seeing anything of this nature before, I posted a question to Facebook to see if anyone else in my area saw anything strange in the night sky. I got a reply to this site from a friend saying that this site(NATIONAL UFO REPORTING CENTER)might be able to answer some questions for me, so I thought I would share my experience for those who are interested in strange aerial phenomenon. Im not saying that what I saw is of extra terrestrial origin but it was something I've never seen before in my lifetime.",

It was the summer of 2011 (I'm sorry I cannot tell you the exact date) and the sky had 100% cloud cover.  The clouds were very low and dark but not too dark.  It looked like a storm of some sort was brewing so me and my partner went out into the street to see what sort of natural spectacle that storms normally produce.   Then without any thunder or noise of any sort a \"grid\" made up of perfect hexagons of what could only appear to be electricity appeared over head.  I would say it formed about 3 rows at a time of chains of perfectly shaped hexagons that moved or scanned back and forth across the sky in an east-to-west direction.   There was no thunder, no rain; only these \"electrical\" shapes.   I was mesmerized but I would say the formation lasted approx. 1 minute and scanned back and forth changing direction several times.   I have never heard of any sort of event and I cannot seem to find anyone who can shed any more light on this.

Dozens (if not more) of people called local news outlets to report them.  When the news outlets contacted RDU airport, they were told that helicopters were conducting \"military exercises\" and that there was \"no threat to public safety,\" and \"nothing to worry about.\" Witnesses (myself, my adult daughter and my sister included) all saw unidentified craft that sometimes hovered, sometimes darted, and that moved at times with incredible speed.  Some of the crafts had only white lights, some had only red lights, some had only intermittent strobes and were completely dark for as much as three to five seconds at a time. First we saw three unidentified craft over the area near Six Forks Road in North Raleigh.  They had white lights and moved very slowly at first.  As we continued to watch them, the left and right aircraft turned off their white lights and turned on much dimmer red lights, at the same time the middle craft became very bright white.   Then they all three went almost dark, and suddenly sped from the Six Forks area, crossing over Falls of Neuse Rd and moving over toward Atlantic Avenue/Capital Blvd at an incredible rate of speed, then suddenly slowed down and resumed moving slowly, at very low altitude, and again with white lights. We then left the area and travelled toward Durham on I-540.   Suddenly the sky was filled with white strobe lights!  The lights would go dark for as much as three to five seconds at a time - there were at least 12 to 15 of these craft and they were moving slowly and at a low to moderate altitude (1000 feet?). While viewing these, three triangular shaped craft with red lights only appeared back toward the airport, at a higher altitude and approximately 45 degrees away from the objects with the strobe lights.  The strobe lights appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly - the red objects were moving more quickly, toward the southwest.   Soon two longer craft appeared in between, shaped almost like long-wing gliders, with a row of white lights down the central part of the object and red flashing lights on each end.  We would occasionlly see commercial airliners landing and/or taking off, and these were obviously not similar to those. At no time did we hear any noise from any of the objects, even those we were closest to.  For the further objects we were not close enough that we would have expected to hear anything. We have been around airports and even Air Force bases all our lives (two of us were Air Force brats growing up, one former U.S. Army infantry veteran and one lived near an Air Force base in California) and we all agreed this objects/craft were unlike anything we had ever seen. We left the area and continued to our homes, west of Durham.",

It was about the size of my pinky thumbnail held at arms length.  The top half was extremely shiny, almost mirror-like, while the bottom half glowed brilliant amber.  The sun was rising behind it at the time and I couldn't tell if the sunrise was reflecting off of it or the glow came from the object itself.  If it was reflecting sunlight at that time of day, the object must have been very large and very high in the sky.  My sense was that it was reflecting sunlight. I turned my attention to the road and back and lost sight of it in that brief time.  Had I not already been late that morning I would've gone looking for it.

I witnessed two reddish/orange (color was pulsating) spheres traveling across the horizon at a slow rate of speed in a direction vector approximately due North.  From my location, the estimated distance of the orbs were approximately less than 1 mile at an altitude of approximately 1000 ft.  They moved in tandem, one trailing the other, but still within close proximity of the lead sphere.  They emiited no sound.  At first glance, I thought they could be aircraft approaching RDU Airport, but realized no noise after a few moments had passed, and the light emission was much greater than normal markers and strobes on a typical aircraft.   The weather was clear and cold. Stars were clearly visible in the background.  I see a lot of air traffic overhead and am confident in my ability to identify various military and civilian aircraft.  These flying objects did not display any visual or audible characteristics of any military or conventional aircraft.  Conclusion.....UFO's!  Without a doubt!",

I was on an interview and was immediately called back in, but not before I could take a picture.  I didn't look at the picture until later that day when I remembered how strange it was.   I looked at it closely and DID NOT alter it at all.  I showed a few friends and family members and the feedback was all the same.   Nobody could explain it at all!  I'm completely baffled and really would like some answers to this strange sighting.   The objects looked like disks with a hole in the center.  One was extremely large.  (Maybe the size of a Walmart store).   The other three around it were much smaller but in a triangular formation and slightly above the larger one.

There was a single flash of light then the light/object continued across the sky in a north east to west trajectory.

She saw it. & it disappeared again. & that\u2019s when I was confused as to what I was seeing. We\u2019re these people ? I haven\u2019t hot boxed that spot in a week. So many questions unanswered. The brightest light was gettin closer & we refused to leave becuz our eyes were amazed. We saw the same thing. We de! cided to run as fast as we could to the house because it wasn't in the air it was more ground level at this point.

A series of amber lights were floating slowly across the sky, north to south at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  There were probably 6-8 of them and they appeared for a minute or two.  I did not see where they went because they went behind the stage where my view was blocked. I assumed that they might be flares the fire department might have been using to test wind direction for the fireworks show that was scheduled later that night but the fire department told me it doesn't use flares in this manner. A check with the 911 center showed no calls reporting lights or flares in the downtown area during that time.

The object moved fast, and had a straight trajectory with no arc as it maintained a parallel path with the ground.  There was only one object.  Due to it being lit, I could not make out the exact shape; however, the lights were confined to a rectangle-like formation.  The light was white. I could not discern the distance above ground, however it was lower than a typical airplane or jet and there was no sound.  The speed was extremely fast.

      "story": "Two concentric rings of light moved slowly across the night sky, stopped for 10 minutes, then moved back in the opposite direction. On a clear night at 9:30pm, I sat in a lounge chair with my girlfriend on my back deck to do some stargazing, maybe catch a meteor or two, and then view the International Space Station that would later pass at 9:57pm.   At 9:38pm I noticed something unfamiliar in the sky with my naked eye in the area of the Andromeda galaxy.  At first I thought I was looking at a star.  However, after looking at it for a few seconds, I noticed it was moving very slowly from East to West, it was larger (not brighter though) than a star and it was  egg-shaped.   At this point I figured it was some unique satellite so I ran to get my binoculars for a closer look.  Within 30 seconds I returned with my Bushnell 10x50 wide angle binoculars.  After focusing in on the object I was completely astonished.  It was two concentric rings of light with two bright spots on the leading edge of the outer ring.   As my girlfriend and I passed the binoculars back and forth, it continued to slow down ! further until it came to a complete stop (relative to the stars in the binocular's field of view) at 9:43pm.  We continued to take turns with the binoculars in complete amazement.   I then decided to go to my neighbor's house to show them this amazing object in the sky.  The parents were out for the evening, but their three kids, their babysitter and I went out onto their back deck.  Everyone had a couple good looks at it.  It was still frozen in place in the sky, however the bright spots on the outer ring of light were on the other side, there were more of them and a little less bright.   I then returned to my house to retrieve and set up my telescope.  I knew it would take about 5 minutes to assemble so I went back to my deck to view the object again.  Now, at 9:53pm, it had started traveling back very slowly in the opposite direction, now going from West to East.  We watched it travel slowly for three minutes, until 9:56pm.  Then we both looked down to talk to each other, ! looked back up and it was nowhere to be seen.  A minute later, at 9:57 pm, we spotted the International Space Station, traveling West to East, across the northern sky.  We continued to search the sky for the object off-and-on for another hour, until 11pm, but never saw it again. In total we viewed this object for over 15 minutes.  I would estimate it was at an altitude comparable to that of satellites orbiting the earth. I have been an avid stargazer for over 30 years that can easily distinguish the planets (by name) from stars with the naked eye, easily spot satellites and have viewed the International Space Station many times, but this was a truly unique object and experience.",

      "story": "Very bright light in evening sky where neither a star nor planet should be and then 3 pulsating lights came through the trees. My husband and I were walking up our driveway around 8:45pm, extremely quiet night & the sky was still bright.  We noticed a really bright stationary steady light (brighter than a planet) in the northeast sky.  No other stars or planets were out.  Just seemed out of place. It didn't move for about 10minutes (we were trying to figure if it was a planet or space station).  Also, it was not where a planet would be (calibrated StarWalk to moon & nothing bright should be there).  My husband was caught off guard & mentioned how it was changing colors.  Then, it disappeared.  We looked for it about 2-3 minutes and all of a sudden reappeared in same position (small light that got brighter and brighter until it was as bright as before..and there were no clouds to distort the view), stationary about 1 minute then IT STARTED MOVING northward (to the left) about the speed of a second hand on a watch. It moved, by perception, about 4 inches across sky then light just quickly phased out.   As soon as it disappeared again My husband saw a pulsating LED light which flashed 3 times, then paused, and flashed 3 times again (about 3 flashes in 2 seconds) coming thru the trees from southeast toward the west.  He mentioned there was a plane coming although there was no noise (we were still looking for the light in the sky).  He thought it was a plane until it stopped on our side of the treeline.  Brilliantly white bright light. Then I saw it.  It followed right under the top tree line (about 50 ft up).  When it got in front our trees but still in the branches, behind our house, then the lights started  going south to north following our tree line (sometimes a little lower in the tree line and then sometimes a little higher but was never lower than about 50 feet) until it got to the top of our  most northward tallest tree & then disappeared.  Just 3 flashing-then-pause-then flashing little but amazingly bright LED-like white lights.  I thought maybe a drone but there was absolutely no noise.  Plus, as my husband pointed out, it was too close into the trees. Please give some rational explanation.",

There were two  noiseless objects with red orange lights flying low in the sky in tandem.  There was absolute silence, so they were definitely not helicopters.  The objects were V-shaped with what appeared to be headlights on the front.  Their speed was slower than a helicopter or any plane that has flown over this residential neighborhood.  They never waivered from their path.  We all watched them until they they were no longer visible.  We all agreed this was nothing we had ever seen before(and yes we were all sober).

I assumed this was a meteor and made a joke about it being either a meteor, a missile or an UFO. Within 10-20 seconds of this, the light reappeared at an elevation of about 40 degrees, still west of us.  It appeared to be a series of 4 extremely bright greenish-blue lights forming a circle around a dim red light.  The 4 lights were rapidly rotating around the red light (at ~15 RPM).  This object rose rapidly, made a turn to the right (north) and suddenly shot back down to the earth (nearly identical to the original sighting but at MUCH closer range). Distance, size and speed is hard to calculate at night (and with an object of unknown size).  That said, the speed at which the object moved was roughly that of a fast moving meteor burning up in the atmosphere.  The object was also much larger on the second sighting, so I'd assume that we were much closer.",

We're traveling in my girlfriend's car on what I believe was Spring of 2012.  She was driving. I'm in the passenger seat and there was no one else besides us in the car.  As we're moving I was looking at all the scenery and it was a beautiful day.  In my peripheral vision, I noticed a large passenger jet somewhat high in the sky.  The jet wasn't low. I'd wager it was flying at roughly 10-20,000 feet. That's when I saw it. Just in front of the jet's path looked to what I can only describe as an Oil Drum or a dark, almost black-looking cylinder, upright like an oil drum.  Now it was hard to tell but it looked like it was up there really close to this jet which was heading towards it. The windows in the car were up so I heard no noise.  It just seemed to hang there, motionless in the sky.  I was excited so I told my girlfriend and she wanted to see it and asked where it was.  I said, \"It's up there, by that plane!\"  Unfortunately, she couldn't look as she was driving.  I probably looked at this thing for about a minute, no more.  As we drove some trees blocked my view.  We pulled up to a traffic light and that's when I looked up again only this time all I could see was the jet and no cylinder. To give an idea of the sizes of this jet and cylinder, at arm's length, the jet would have been about the size of my thumb and the cylinder was about 1/3 that size.  I wish I could give more information but the sighting was brief. Just one last thing.  As I said, I was unfamiliar with the area, but I know we used to live a mile west of Route 1, a.k.a. (Capital Blvd).  We lived off of Durant road between Capital Blvd. and Falls of Neuse Rd.  The sighting was not too far from this area.  I wish I could tell you the name of the road we were on, but all I can tell you is we were no more than 5 miles from our house on our way to get a burger from this great little burger and hotdog place where you walk up to the window and they take your order.  When it's ready they call your number, go up to the window, get your food, and then we would just sit in our car and eat.  That's the best description I can give as, yet again, I can't remember the name of the place!",

      "story": "3 lights single object Saw 3 lights moving in unison, slowly in the same direction over my neighborhood. It was heading West. 3 lights blinking one at a time from West to East. Light blinking repeated once a second in total for all 3 lights blinking in a loop - 1,2,3 - 1,2,3  No engine sounds.  Looked extremely wide/long from our view. The light's rate of blinking sort of looks like normal aircraft.  Only there were 3 lights, and all 3 lights moved together, and their blinking pattern was synced up as if highlighting a single shape.  Unclear if disc/chevron/whatever. If it was 3 helicopters, they did a really good job going at the same speed in the same direction, really really slow.  I've seen normal helicopters flying over my house before.  Lights look different, and I can hear the engines. Only other simplified guess I can make is some kids tied 3 drones together with a really really long fishing line.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was more than 1 to 3 miles long.  I'm no pilot or anything.  So my ability to judge the distance/speed/size is based on only my understanding that a traffic light is as big as I am close up. Uploaded video to youtube:  https://youtu.be/pr8p7LcCZ5M",
