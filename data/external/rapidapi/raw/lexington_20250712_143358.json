      "story": "STATIONARY FLASHING LIGHT We were star gazing on the evening of Saturday April 1, 2006 when it dawned on us that there was a flash of light located south of the constellation Leo that was about the size of a typical star.  The flash of light had a frequency of between 15 to 30 seconds and appeared to be the same color of a strobe light.  It varied in magnitude from bright (like that of a magnitude -1 star) to dim (like that a magnitude +3 or higher star) and was generally stationary, displaying occaisional slight varience from time to time.  We observed this phenomenon for close to 25 minutes.  Although we were using both a pair of binoculars and a telescope in our stargazing, we could only sight the object in the pair of binoculars. ((NUFORC Note:  Over recent years, we have received a number of reports that are similar to this one.  We have no idea what the cause of the light",

My father and I couldn\u2019t identify the object, initially assuming it was a blimp, but it was far too high.  It remained stationary for the ten minutes we observed it.  My mother and neighbor also witnessed the object, but they weren\u2019t as intrigued.  I had to get my kids home to Kearney before their bedtime, so I drove away. Location: Lexington, NE; Dawson County Call received in: Kearney, NE; Buffalo County Date: 6/21/19 Time: ~21:12  I received a call from my father around 21:00 where he told me that the object was still hanging in the same location.  We spoke for about 10 minutes before he excitedly mentioned an object with a flaming tail moving toward the initial UFO.  He didn\u2019t mention any sort of strike, but the second \u201cflame-tail\u201d object continued moving east.   Within a minute, I could see this second object above Kearney, flying surprisingly low.  It was streaking a pair of vapor trails as it flew east.  It was flying low enough that my phone could flicked in and out of focus on it as I trying taking snapshots.  What my dad assumed was a flaming tail, I figured was the reflection of the sunset on the lower-rear hull, as the sun was setting.  As low as the plane was, the wingspan seemed too narrow to be a commercial airliner.  It was also flying far faster than I recall my flight from Denver to Omaha ever going, as it flew into Kearney airspace and left it in what felt like less than a minute. As a strange coincidence, several sirens started going off near my house at the same time.  I couldn\u2019t tell if they were police or ambulance sirens, but they faded before long.",

It did, however, appear to emit a spotlight of sorts?  That\u2019s the best way I can describe it.   After I\u2019d lost sight of it, I noticed what were clearly man made aircraft traveling in the direction of the unknown craft; one man made craft on either side of the unknown craft.   Whatever it was, was in no hurry to get anywhere and was not afraid to be conspicuous.  It flew low enough that I could see a solid, white or yellow light on the belly of the craft.   Almost like a submarine, only flying.  All I know is that it was an unidentifiable flying aircraft to me.  I know it was something that other people have seen, as well.",

      "story": "A 2 hour sighting of fireball with orbiting mini fireballs and an array of white dots in the sky with unusual movements I was about 13 years old when I saw this event. I was lying in my bed, which was next to a window on the second story of my house. The window was facing southwest and across the street was another two-story house with trees to either side. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and seeing a bright red-orange fire ball in the sky above the house across the street. It was about the size of the full moon in the sky, but appeared to be much closer. It was bright, but it was lighting anything up on the ground, at least from where I was positioned. The fireball was shooting out small bits of fire, which would orbit the ball for a time leaving a trail behind them before plunging back into the main body of the ball. There were clearly flames on the surface of the ball, as well. It looked a lot like what you might imagine an atom with its orbiting electrons to look like. Small specks of fire swinging around the fire ball in all directions. Furthermore, to the right of the object I have just described was an array of white dots, larger than stars, but quite small. In the sky, this would be probably six times the diameter of the fireball in distance. These white dots would line up in two rows (there were probably 8 of them) and then one on the end would scoot through the sky, at first slowly and then with increasing speed, toward the fireball, then stop and turn down and head back to the main group ending up in the lower row, when it originally been in the upper. I watched for probably an hour and a half taking in the beauty of what I was seeing. I contemplated waking up my parents and nearly did so, but I was reluctant to take my eyes off the phenomenon in case I were to miss something. I never woke them up and eventually went back to sleep. The date I have proposed is approximate. I have only recently begun to share this story with people because in the past when I tried I was met only with skepticism, which is, I suppose, the right response. In any case, it seems to have stuck with me a! nd now I would like some answers. The only possibility I can think of, which does not rule one way or the other in terms of extraterrestrial activity or otherwise, is that it had something to do with the nearby Hanscom air force base. This air force base is in a pretty densely populated area, so it doesn't seem like it would be a good location for top-secret technology testing, although I have heard that some of the research on stealth fighter planes was carried out there.

I was driving down Man O'War Blvd one evening at around 7 or 8 pm, returning from my University.  I turned right onto Winchester Rd by the channel 36 news station headed towards Paris.  I love the scenery out in that area, and turned my head to look at one of the beautiful farms there.   Right above the horizon at a distance I cannot even begin to calculate was a very large cigar shaped object that was glowing a radiant reddish orange color.  It looked to me like a huge metallic blimp that was catching the setting sun or something.  The road, being heavy with traffic at that time was not to be ignored, so I looked back at the road as to not rear end someone.  I looked back over at the sky, and the object was no longer there.  This object was clearly and obviously there a few seconds earlier.  I have tried to justify every possible explanation....maybe the sun reflecting off of some kind of cloud.... Whatever it was it was very strange. I haven't told anyone about this because of fear of ridicule. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We then saw something far more remarkable toward the south, about midway up in the sky from the horizon. It was much smaller and not at all as bright, but it was distinctly flashing. At first, we took it to be a plane, but we quickly realized that it was completely stationary. What on Earth could do that? \tWe looked at it through binoculars, and still could not figure it out. The lights were flashing very rapidly, with a blue one on one side and a red one on the other that alternated. Both were backed by a white light that did not seem to flash. Since it was so far away, we could not make out any real shape to it, though it seemed to me to be a bit narrow, like a grain of rice. \tI attempted to photograph it, but my camera is not good enough to pick up stars at all, let alone odd flashing things. At 10:20 PM, it was still out there in the exact same place. At 11:00, we checked again, and saw that it had moved far above and west of its previous position. Its lights were now flashing on a diagonal instead of being horizontally oriented toward the ground. The surrounding stars had not moved as much. It was hard to tell, but it seemed to be moving very gradually continuing in the same direction in which it had moved before. It is probably still out there. \tIt is highly uncharacteristic for any of us to go staring at the sky here (light pollution makes stargazing unfeasible), and we only did so because Venus was so irresistably bright. My brother in particular is a very pragmatic person and normally scoffs at anything fantastical, yet he stood out there watching this object longest of all. This is absolutely the first time any of us has ever seen anything inexplicable in the night sky, and we are not particularly interested in UFOs. I have never even heard the others mention them. However, we are now very interested in this one! Even if it turns out to be nothing, we hope to somehow find out more.",

I was driving home from my dads house on New Circle when I saw a really bright light up in the sky, at first I thought it was a star. Then I saw it was in fact an object of some type, though I couldn't really make it out. I passed this figuring it was just some helicopter hovering perfectly above the road. Then, maybe 5 minutes later, I was still on New Circle between exit 5A and 5B (I was getting off at 5B, onto Versailles Rd.) when I saw a low flying object slowly come down at an angle towards the ground as if to land (though the airport is not over there and I don't know of any airstrip in that direction). I at first thought it was a plane but then the object stopped in mid-air, hovering. It had at least 3 bright white lights on it, and 1 red blinking light (thus I thought it to be a commercial plane at first). The shape of it seemed to be pretty thin, shaped kind of like a saucer. It looked to me like it had a flat top and the edges came out at slight diaganols pointing towards the ground. I was not able to get a very good look for long because I was driving and was literally just about at my exit, though I did brake to slow down and get a longer look. I have no clue if it made noise or not, I happened to be listening to my radio very loudly at the sighting. I believe that some others on the road saw it and thought it was something strange as well, as I noticed cars braking abnormally near the object.",

Interestingly was it seemed to have a well-defined start and end from a direction of WSW to ENE or a heading of 60 degrees from north.  A very small of indistinguishable shape object in the front seemed to be the source of the smokey emission. After the passing of a minute or so, the apparent emitting object was a visual one-inch at 20-inch arm\u2019s length ahead of the trail. The trail appeared to be 4\u201d long.  To observe better, we drove under a cross-country power line to give us good visual reference at distance to observe two more features, one of which was the trail and the object appeared not to move for about 2 minutes and contact was lost with the object either as darkness was approaching or just too small to see.  The trail after 5 minutes of observation seemed to begin to break up.  Its total length never appeared to be greater than 4 inches at the 20 inch arm length. The color of the trail was much darker than a jet would have been. My explaination.  The dispersion of the trail gave the appearance of something at altitudes between 5,000 and 50,000 feet running an internal combustion engine with piston that had just broken an oil ring or an oil leak in an engine causing a black smoke to come from the engine until the engine exhausted all its oil and locked up or shut down.  Though the sun had just set, the sky was well bright enough to distinguish this event from a standard jet trail by virtue of the darkness of the apparent smoke.  The other unique feature was the sudden start of the trail and the sudden end to the trail and the extremely small object continuing with a 060 heading after the smoke trail finished.

My first thought was that it was sunlight reflecting off a aircraft.Then it dawned on me that I could not see any aircraft anywhere in the sky. I then began to walk to the back of the property when I saw one and then a second flash a little to the west of where I saw the first flash. These two flashes where white instead of orange. I watched for a few minutes but saw nothing else and went back to the dog walking thing. After several minutes I turned around and looked at the spot where I had seen the flashes and saw a large ball of light that I at first thought was a star. Then it became clear this was not a star and was blinking. The blinking reminded me of a old rotating police light. The light was white and I could see flashes of blue or green in it. There was another smaller blinking light underneath and to the west of the larger light that wa! s moving very slowly as if it were searching for something. I walked back to the house and continued to watch the lights and got my mom to come outside and look. She agreed that the lights were odd and did not look like any aircraft. We then went back inside and due to the cold and I came back out a few minutes later and the lights were gone. I was never nervous while observing this, just curious as to what the light could be and how odd it was to be there. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Northeast to Southwest or reverse.   Depending upon atmospheric conditions the light may appear bright white or blue .. again also depending upon the aircraft. There is also a famous Vineyard in the area and the owner employs a Lear Jet in his travels - often flying low.  No noise is heard until the aircraft is close or passes overhead.  The local airport is nearby and low approach speed maintains an optical illusion of a non-moving object when approaching HEAD ON to the viewer.. Lexington also falls under a main sky route hub between Greensboro/Winston-Salem and Charlotte and it is not unusual for heavy air traffic .... the planes often employ landing strobes .. but the actual ONCOMING path makes it appear stationary until they get overhead and then one can see the FAA required aircraft lights (i.e. green/red .... varied blinking lights, wing lights, etc.) . Many others have seen similar objects and mistook them for ... Unidentified, until that typical jet noise \"catches up\". I am not sure if this applies to the above situation, but may be a possible explanation. This evening I have seen many .... heavy air traffic ... some small aircraft ... strobes are flashed when they are approximate to each other.  TWO in particular were unusual and did NOT follow the normal flight route; however I had assumed that they were the result of heavy inbound/outbound air traffic (Holiday) and may have been put on a \"holding\" pattern.  The night was very clear, the aircraft did NOT make noise, but assumed (again) the sound would follow.  It didn't; however the movement was consistent with usual flight speed with no deviations from a straight course, nor any change in speed.  Both objects moved from NORTH to SOUTH, EACH about ten minutes apart - EACH taking about ten minutes to cross.  The ONLY thing unusual were that there were NO FAA lights .. just a solid white light. Note:  Many dogs in the area were howling during this ... particular sighting. Nothing follows, nor is follow-up necessary.  Reported FYI only.",

The object was witnessed aboard a McDonnell Douglass MD-82 twin jet aircraft traveling eastbound at 33,000 feet and 497 knots. At the time of the sighting the aircraft was at latitude 37.87 and longitude -79.79, placing the aircraft between Covington and Lexington, VA. The aircraft was in radio contact with the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), and traveling between the waypoints ASBUR and DENNY on jet airway 42 (J42). The object was witnessed off of the left side of the aircraft traveling north (right to left) at an extremely high velocity. The object appeared spherical in shape and bright white and glowing in color. The object appeared to leave some sort of contrail, which may have been a distortion of light due to speed. The object contained no other sources of light typically found on civilian aircraft. The object disappeared from horizontal view within 2-3 seconds, moving at a speed much greater that that of an approaching opposite direction jet aircraft. The object had an apparent size of 1/4 the circumference of a full moon, and looked similar to a shooting star or meteorite. Size relative to the aircraft could not be determined. The object appeared to be between 35,000 and 38,000 feet, 2,000-5,000 feet above the aircraft. The trajectory of the object resembled an ascending arch. According to NASA\u2019s website, the International Space Station was not in the area at the time of the sighting. Other aircraft were also in the vicinity at the time. The object was witnessed by a more than one person, including trained observers. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we deem him to be an exceptionally good witness.

      "story": "orbs of light circling the moon. The first of four UFO sightings I have experienced happened in 2004.  I am not sure on any specific dates though I am sure about the month and that it was late July of my first sighting.  I was with two friends at the time. We were juniors in high school, thus for a long time I did not feel I was credible enough to come forth with the sightings, however, as I am now a college graduate, mind has not changed that what I saw were UFOs. The first two sightings both consisted of nothing more than orbs of light in the sky, to far and too small to distinguish much more than it was a ball.  I did not think these relevant for a long time until I recently saw a computer simulation made by UFO specialists to try to recreate something someone had seen.  It looked a lot like what we had seen. Lexington is a small resort town in Michigan.  There are lots of beaches, but we only night swim in the harbor as it is really sandy.  We face the east so see the sun and moon rise. On that particular night I was with two friends, all three of us were carelessly watching the sky for at least an hour or so, as it was an extremely bright night.  The beach is maybe a quarter of a mile from the road, with no nearby lights, so we were used to it being abnormally dark.  On that night, it was extremely bright, the moon was full and there were tons of stars shining.  The sky wasn\u2019t even black, not even velvety, but a moonlit blue. It was because of the clear visibility that I believe there was more in the sky than what we specifically focused on.  The orbs looked very much like stars. When we first noticed one it seemed to be traveling towards the moon.  We\u2019re not far from some airports and military bases, so we know what normal lights look like.  These were not normal.  They were just about the size of the stars, maybe just slightly bigger, and instead of having a golden hue on the edge like a star, they were white lights with blue hues on their edges. As we watched one travel towards the moon from the east, one of my friends spotted another coming from the northwest.  The one from the east was traveling much faster, and in a direction we could not attribute to any known flight path.  At that point we were still willing to dismiss the sighting as nothing more than planes but they were too high. The most intriguing part came when the orb from the east reached the moon. Instead of flying under it, as we expected the light to do, it began circling it, and not in a two-demential manner, but a three-demential one, where the orb actually disappeared behind the moon for a few minutes and returned to the side we could see only to go back around again. As the orb from the northwest came right up to the moon it too began circling it too, but in the opposite direction.  As that was happening several more orbs of light started heading towards the moon.  As one of my friends began to panic, I was out numbered on the vote to remain and though I kept my eyes on it the entire time by the time we got to the car the offending orbs never came back around from the other side of the moon, all the orbs had stopped moving and the sky looked still again. That was about it for that one. It lasted maybe ten minutes or so.  We were young, B+ and A students and though even writing it sounds strange I know what I saw.  When I later told another close friend about it, she too had seen the strange lights from her home in Croswell, Michigan, six miles away.  For the rest of the week we observed glimpses of these lights and more and more people came into the school talking about them.  The talk lasted a while, but everyone dismissed it as skeptical parents insisted we saw military jets.   I am sure that is not what it was.  My father, who\u2019s twin brother is a pilot, agreed that this sighting along with my other three are legitimately unexplained. I have no photos of any of my sightings but will be sending a package of some maps and a few sketches with this story via mail.

Three in a line and a fourth trailing behind I was upstairs in bed when my friend came up after viewing late nite news at approximately 11:50 pm on June 28, 2011.  He screamed at me from the other upstairs bedroom to come and see these objects.  They were four orange orbs flying in formation at a low altitude towards our home..about 500 feet above ground-helicopter flight space for our police helicopters..there were three in a line around 50 yards apart and one behind around 100 yards flying directly behind the middle orb.  We rushed downstairs and watched.  They executed a 45 degree turn and crossed our yard at a slow speed...never changing formation.  They were the size of the full moon about three quarters up in the sky and there was movement inside like moving crystals..sooo hard to describe and the air was disturbed around them..Very scary. There was absolutely no sound from the objects.  I went inside and got my camara.  I was very excited and fumbling with the camera.  I managed to get them in s! ight as they moved over the houses behind my home.  I was so upset I forgot to take the flash off.  When I took the picture the sky lit up and the back orb went out...just like that...Then as they moved on it came back on more dimly.  Unfortunately, the flash blackened out the sky and took a pic of my patio umbrella which was in the side forground of the pic.  We called the police, a tv station and I spoke with an air traffic controller at the airport, but at that time no one had reported these things.  We later checked chinese laterns, but these things were under control.  They stayed in formation and one extinguished the light in response to my camera flash!  We have sketches of what we saw.",

She would never fabricate a story intentionally and I have never heard her say anything else anywhere near as un-explained. UFO reported sighting in Lexington, SC June 2006 Sighted by ((female's name deleted)). Interviewed by ((husband's initials deleted)). This interview comes on account of a recent (in fact today) sighting by my wife.  Since she had seen a previous sighting some years before, I wanted to compile the two and submit them to the web.  This information below is about a sighting she had in the summer of 2006. Spooky, Near Earth Space Station  When my wife first told me about the sighting, she said, \"I think I saw the space station.  It was really weird!  I had no idea what to think back then, her description though fascinating, boggled my mind, so I basically ignored it.  Now I will document that sighting.  Today I interviewed her;  \"It looked like something you would see in a movie.  \"It was big.  I could see the \"person\" in it.\"  If you stretched out your arms straight out at length, in front of you, you would have to spread the fingers about 16-20 inches to equal the apparent length of it. How far away was it?  It was close?   \u201cIt WAS close!  I didn't look at it long at all, I simply gasped in shock, and turned around and shut the  door behind me quickly.  All I can say is that it was close!  I saw a \u201cperson\u201d with \u201cspiky hair\u201d in it. What direction did it move?  \u201cIt was just above the row of \u201cred-tips\u201d (an evergreen shrub of the south U.S.) and it was either hovering or moving slightly to my left. What time of day was it?  \u201cIt was midnight.\u201d  What time of the year?  \u201cIt was about 2 months after we moved here.\u201d  So that would make it June 2006?  \u201cYes that sounds right.\u201d  What happened?  \u201cI was on the phone with my friend Melissa.  I didn't want to wake anyone else, so I headed outside.  I opened the side (deck) door, stepped out and there it was.  I said 'Uh-oh!' and turned right around back inside.  I told my friend that I was going to bed and hung the phone up on her right there and then.  I went to bed.\u201d \t\u201cSome days later when I explained to my friend what happened, she said \u201csometimes you can see the space station.  Maybe that was what you saw.\u201d  But she didn't realize this thing was so near that I could see a 'person' inside it.  But it made absolutely no noise at all.  What was it?!?\u201d  Description:  \tBased upon the witnesses description and testimony, the interviewers best guess at size would be approx 8 feet high by 20-25 feet long, rectangular about 2.5 to 3 times as long as it's height.  \u201cIt was white with two large windows directly facing me.\u201d  (Based upon the drawing, these windows covered at least 50% of the exposed area.  There might be about 1.5 feet around the edges (and separating the two), all around the windows comprising the rest of the object.  There seemed to be two seating areas, and a \u201cperson with spiky hair\u201d sat on the window to my left.\"  What was \"he\" doing?  \"There was a control panel that 'he' was 'guiding' the craft with.  Any lights?  There was a \u201cregular\u201d yellowish light on inside it, with no lights on the outside.\u201d What was on the other (right) side?  \"Nothing.  It looked the same as the left side, but no-one was there.  I just saw the one \u201cperson.\u201d  Conclusion:  \tMyself the interviewer (and husband) know that the story is either an apparition or completely true, but not a work of fiction.  My wife would never make something like this up.  So I wonder what would be the best cause for the sighting? The best match for a man made object would seem to be the cockpit of a large dirigible.  But Amanda saw NO dirigible along the top of the object, and this would have been a much larger portion of the object, but nothing like that was seen.  And the sited object was very low, and CLOSE and it made (she insisted time and again) absolutely NO noise.  Myself (and the family 3-4 years later) have witnessed the travels of a dirigible in the surrounding area about town, and that dirigible maintained at least 400-500 feet above the trees and moved very noisily at maybe 25-35 MPH.  It was flashing a red \u201cbillboard\u201d advertisement.  I would have to estimate that the sited (UFO) object was only 200-250 feet above the ground, and only at most the same linear distance, as there was the view of a \u201cperson with spiky hair\u201d at the \u201ccontrol panel.\u201d  Unknown Flying Object. ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS)) Rectangle with two large portals and a figure at the controls up VERY close. This is an amendment or addition to a previous report I submitted about 3 days ago.  I searched tonight online and found a drawn depiction of a UFO sighting that very closely matches that sighting that my Wife saw midnight 6-1-2006.  My wife said \"Yeah!  That's it!  Except that I didn't see any of the back part.\"   Here is the web-link to that photo:   http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_tlidr95gRew/TU6GTm-CIMI/AAAAAAAABoY/UC36IOfPBV8/s1600/Chile%2BUFO%2B2008%2Bwith%2BHumanoids.jpg   So what my wife saw was a white object very similar to the forward rectangular shape of that picture with a single figure on the LEFT.   She said a yellowish light shone from within.   The sighting lasted only a few seconds, and she fled back inside the house. ((END ADDENDUM))",

The backyard is about a half acre deep to a fence line which adjoins to a cow pasture.   It is about 50 - 75 feet before the tree line begins in the cow pasture.  Not a bird as it had no wings and was utterly silent.  It did not lose any altitude and was so dimly lit that it disappeared as soon as it passed over.  It seemed to have a very fine, thin trail at least 25+ ft that also dissolved into thin air.  Very eerie experience.

      "story": "Two red/orange orbs moving south to north over east side of Lexington, KY; no sounds At approximately 11:30 pm EDST (23.30) on the east side of Lexington, Kentucky, on March 29, 2013: My small dog was agitated at the back door, barking excitedly, which is uncharacteristic for her. When I went to see what the matter was, she was excitedly indicating that she wanted to go outside. Normally she will just sit at the door patiently waiting if she wants to go outside.  I let her out, and followed onto the back deck as she descended the steps into the back yard. It was at that point that I noticed a red orb hovering stationary slightly to the north of me, high in the sky. It was too large to be the red wing light of an airplane. It did not move as I observed it for perhaps 30 to 60 seconds. I went inside to get my iphone in order to take a picture, and it was still visible when I returned, but had started moving very slowly in a northerly direction.  I took pictures and a short video (or thought I did; this morning those pictures and video do not appear on my phone, but two others, taken later from the upstairs deck are on my phone.)  My wife had already gone to bed, so I went upstairs to our bedroom, woke her up and told her what I was seeing. There is a second floor deck off our bedroom, and we went there, where the object was still clearly visible, continuing to slowly move in a northerly direction.  I then saw a second identical object which was much closer to us, but about the same apparent altitude, moving south to north. This second object was slightly to the west of us, but nearly overhead. It was moving slowly toward the location of the first object. When we looked back to the last location of the first object, it was no longer visible.  We watched the second object move very slowly\u2014much too slowly for a fixed wing aircraft\u2014in the same south to north trajectory. Eventually the second object disappeared as we watched. It did not go off into the distance, it just disappeared. The apparent size of the objects was the same. My recollection is that at the first sighting of the second object it was about the size of a dime held at arm\u2019s  length. My wife\u2019s recollection is that it was larger, i.e. about the size of a quarter held at arm\u2019s length. We agree that the apparent size was smaller than a full moon. The moon, at the time, was far east of these objects, which were high in the sky as opposed to near the horizon. Unquestionably these objects were not stars, both because of size and the fact that they moved.  As to color, I saw both objects as being red. My wife saw them as being orange, although she also saw what appeared to be a small red \u201cdot\u201d in the center of both objects. I did not observe this \u201cdot\u201d.  Regarding photographs: This morning I looked at the photos on my camera. To my great surprise, there was no video whatsoever, and only one still shot of one of the objects. It appears to be the second one, due to it\u2019s apparent size in the photo. The photo was taken at full zoom on an iphone 5. When the photo itself is enlarged, the object does not appear to be an orb at all, but rather appears to have a crescent shape, with curve on the bottom, but with the top tilted slightly to the west. Upon closer inspection, we thought it appeared to have a \u201csaucer\u201d shape, with the bright crescent being at the bottom. It is also possible the impression appears because of something which may be the \u201cred dot\u201d appears above the crescent. I have not magnified the photo beyond what I can do by zooming into the photo with the iphone. The color of the crescent in the photo is much more white than the appearance of the color to our naked eyes. As I said, I would call it red, although tending toward an orange-ish red as opposed to bright red, while my wife says the color was orange with a \u201cred dot\u201d.  The other photo is completely black, as if only a picture of the night sky. I am baffled as to why there are only two still photos on my phone from last night, and no video whatsoever. I am certain I shot both, downstairs as well as upstairs. My wife thinks that I may have failed to properly take the shots due to my excitement, but I disagree. I clearly recall both the action the phone does after taking a still shot, as well as seeing the video icon active.  At no time was there any sound heard from these objects, at least by we humans. It may be that the dog heard something which caused her agitation.  Backgrounds of the observers: I am an attorney. My wife is a dental tech. I am in my early 60\u2019s; my wife is in her late 50\u2019s.",

      "story": "Weird Unexplained  events Let me start by saying that these events have accrued over a period of months; I\u2019ll start from the beginning.   A few days after May 31, the release of the movie \u201cAfter Earth\u201d.  My friend, His Mother, and I were heading back from a local movie theater when we traveled down a back road, we hadn\u2019t been on the road too long before we noticed something catching our eye off to the right of the vehicle, passing the object we paid no mind till breaking in the middle of the lane and reversing  (Please note we were the only ones in the lane or on that certain road)  The driver of the vehicle put it in park before exiting the driver\u2019s side (My friend) His mother and I watch from the passenger seat and the back.  What we saw all of three of describe as;  a bright blinding chrome orb that was sitting stilly at tree top level before moving slowly to the right further across the sky leaving a trail behind it before dissipating into the night.  We had no clue what we had just seen but we all agreed it was not a normal aircraft or an aircraft at all.  We decided to call the local police department to report what we had seen earlier in the evening before feuding to keep it a secret. Over a various of months we had seen the orbs multiple more times it began to scare both my friend and I to the point we didn\u2019t know what to do;  It would do what the first night did. It would move lightly leave a trail and vanish,  Still the same blinding chrome orb, but the freakiness had just began.  My friend and his mother have always lived in the woods, now he\u2019s seen the orbs out there more than twice, but with added affects.  He knows what the sounds of the forest should sound like and look like.  When he steps out of his home late at night he begins to experience strange sounds unlike any he has heard before and has seen figures described as Humanoid, but not quite so.  I on the other hand have not had the \u201cpleasure\u201d of meeting or hearing such creatures, but I have, like him, seen the orbs on multiple occasions. We don\u2019t personally know how to describe the next experience, but I\u2019ll try to.  We don\u2019t know whether to take this a ironic and unrelated dream, but my friend tents to stay with me in my home every now and again because I mostly live alone, one night whilst I was asleep,  He had said he woke up to the light from a street lamp we have in our front yard he moved my curtains to peer out into the yard seeing a sleek, slender, tall man standing motionlessly in the front yard by the lamp,  He said he closed the curtains before returning to peer again the creature closer than before,  He repeated the process till the creature was peering in back at him, he said he tried to wake me to no avail. Ironically he said it stared till day light which is when he \u201cwoke up\u201d.  The creature\u2019s facial features where described as boney thin very pale and solid black eyes. The most recent and most creepy and most disturbing one Friday, October 4, 2013 at 3:30am my friend had went outside by our pool to smoke before rushing back in calling my name and calling me outside I casually walk outside to seem him shaking almost dropping his cigarette and pale as a ghost he said he was looking to the stars before seeing a formation over the home that he had not noticed before he was shocked to see that he recognized the \u201cstars\u201d to be the orbs we\u2019ve seen before but in a triangular formation and not emitting a trail as before.  He told me that it had hovered over the home for a few minutes before moving over our pond silently (At tree level) before disappearing and as this was happing he heard nothing it was completely silent till it disappeared.  Not long after dogs began to bark, then multiple whines and whimpers.  Strange sounds fallowed after words such as loud knocking and weird sounds indescribable.  He then went on to add that at the end of a small gate that leads to the dam of my pond he said he once again saw a Humanoid, but this one looked more human than creature despite the fact it was for only split second.",

We witnessed a singular light high in the sky, virtually silent traveling from the nw to the se.  Not on the normal flight path to the south of us for ABIA.  It didn't do anything weird or crazy just an oddly bright star-like light.  Much brighter than a satellite and no blinking lights like a plane.  Within 10 to 15 minutes two jets of a fighter type came traveling from the se to the nw at varying altitudes almost retracing the lights path.  I'm an OIF Army vet and my wife was a Navy MA, we both have experience with flight lines and various aircraft.  The star-like light seemed abnormal, the fighter craft did not. Then again on 06/25/13 we stepped outside and planted some chairs to watch. We again witness the star-like light to the east traveling in a more n to s flight path. Again abnormal without blinking lights nor any sound.  We again witnessed two regular type craft approximately 20 to 25 minutes later retracing the star-like lights path.  Too far away to tell if they were fighters or not, but had blinking lights as normal.  Going out again tomorrow and going to try to film it if able.",

The following sightings were observed by two individuals between 11:30 Est and 11:45 EST over Lexington, KY.  Four identical and unrecognized lights, amber-red in color and roughly diamond shaped, with the weight of the diamond pointing downward, appeared from the east, on a low approach, less than 90 seconds apart. These light configurations, shape, and behaviors were unlike anything either of the observers had previously seen.  The lights were at least three times the height of typical commercial air liner lights relative to the apparent altitude and distance, were only made up of one color, amber-red, and did not have any obvious flashing patterns.  We live less than 3 miles from LEX airport and are very familiar with mundane commercial aircraft, helicopter, and private general aviation light patterns, color, and flight paths in this area. All four diamond lights followed the same flight path.  The flight path approached Lexington from the east-south east and at a low angle over the tree line.  In all four instances, the lights seemed to move slowly over the north-east portion of the city before turning to the due north.  They followed the same accent, flying at an approximate 30 degree angle upward, relative to their approach angle.  All four diamond lights disappeared in succession, 30 seconds apart and in about one third of their approach time. In each case, and at a similar point over the city, a small red flash was seen to drop away from the parent lights.  These occurred in the same fashion with each parent light, with the exception of the last and fourth light. The Last and fourth light followed the same path and dropped a similar flash from the parent light and at the same location as the previous three, except, the fourth diamond shape dropped two additional small lights approximately 15 seconds apart for a total of 3 dropped infant lights before turning to the north and disappearing in the same fashion and direction as the previous three. The infant lights from all four sightings had a visible duration of less than two seconds before disappearing from view.  Each infant light was of the same or similar color and brightness as the parent lights, but about one-one hundredth the size.  All infant lights had the same angle of drop which was 90 degrees straight down relative to the earth. Approximately two minutes after these sightings, a commercial air liner made an approach to the Lexington Airport from the east-southeast.  This approach seemed  unusual, relative to the average airline approach, in that the airliner's approach was unusually shallow. Additional high level air traffic was observed for several minutes after, moving north-easterly from the south-west, due east from the west, and north-westerly from the south-east respectively, several minutes after the initial sightings. Both observers are male professionals in their early 50's and college educated.",

The sun had set behind me (to the west) but the sky was still to bright to see anything in that direction, thus I was looking easterly.  At the time I was looking through a 40 mm lenses and using an 80mm telescope which gives approximately 10X magnification.  At this magnification mars fills about \u00bd the visual field. This is when something transited from right to left (south to north) through the field of view at what appears to be Mars\u2019s equatorial region.  This is to say, it was observed in the field of view beyond Mars and passed somewhere between earth and Mars, exiting my field of view well past Mars.  Indicating it was NOT on Mars, but between Earth and Mars.  (Perhaps, this object was in Earth orbit?)  This pass lasted for only a fraction of a second and the object appeared white (I am color blind, but it appeared white to Mars\u2019s red body with white polar caps as I see them.)  This object was tiny, almost appearing as a grain of sand. I immediately pulled my head back to see with my unaided eye, but saw only Mars.  (Note: no other planets nor stars were yet visible due to the fading sunset.)  My binoculars (25X70) were next to my telescope, so I grabbed them and scanned the area but saw nothing.  The object was gone. At this point, I ruled a lenses flair, the angle of the sun and my telescope was incorrect.  Due to the recent freezing temperatures, there were no insects flying around and insects have never been visible to me through that level of magnification.  I considered a satellite, but the orbit seems wrong and the app on my phone did not show any satellites in that vicinity. I am not entirely certain this was a craft\u2026I do not know what it was, but if others saw this, I would like to validate their sighting.",

My grandparents own a small cottage in a semi-residential area with other small summer-houses around them.  The area is beautiful and serene, and every evening we enter the dirt roads of the farms across our main expressway to the town's center to spot deer.  This tradition has been carried down from generation to generation, as my family has lived in Michigan since the mid 17th century. The anomaly I witnessed tonight was strange and erie, yet fascinating; an orb of light darted and hovered about 19 miles to the side of of our car for about a minute or less. We had stopped to watch the sunset, a beautiful one at that, and watched the dazzling colors of maroon and orange descend to the east.   However, after the sun set, my grandmother noticed a single orange light hovering in place for about 10-15 seconds.   We watched it for a little bit, but as we started the car up, the engine made the usual raucus noise that it does.  It was at this time that I noticed the light darting up to the right of its former position.   I don't know if it was the engine or our presence that startled it, but as it flew away it began to morph colors to match the darkening sky, and within seconds was gone, camouflaged like a chameleon. I have alway believed in life beyond our solar system, and even intelligent life.  I would have never imagined to see something like this in my life.

      "story": "Strange light in the sky seen while camping I went out camping in the summer of 2005 with my scout troop.  We were camping on private property near Lexington, SC.  The event happened late at night while we were watching the fire and talking.  One of the troop leaders said that he had been watching a satellite that was crossing the sky, and then it had just stopped.  He pointed out to us where it was.  At first it just looked like a star in the sky.  It seemed a little odd because satellites usually blink and are not a constant light. After a while the light started to move around erratically.  This continued for some minutes then there was a small flash and the light split into two pieces.  After this happened one piece just stayed still and the other piece darted off across the sky.  I have no idea at the speed but it must have been pretty quick.  The other piece stayed there a while more and then it started to act erratically again.  After some time it then too darted off across the sky in the opposite direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I quickly put the dogs in the house and grabbed my cell phone to film the unusual lights.  Nothing seemed to be showing up on my phone at all.  (Later, I was able to capture a section of the video that shows light streaks and not the two red orbs.)   I continued to watch them until they were out of sight - about 10 minutes.  There was no sound, and they were moving extremely slow.  They stayed in the same formation the entire time.   These lights were too large to be from any plane and the angle was like nothing I have seen before.  Had it been a plane, I would have heard some kind of sound and the lights would not have been on a diagonal or as large as they were.   I have never seen anything fly this slowly and still stay in the air. This is my second sighting in Lexington.  The last unusual sighting was a large white light - like a very large star - that moved very quickly with no sound.",

Witnesses were lounging in the grass of the backyard with their dogs when the lady noted a black, triangular shape object hovering above her house.  They were both laying on their backs and it was directly above them in the sky.   She looked at it for at least a minute before pointing it out to her boyfriend, who then also studied it...he confirmed that it was black (or at least dark) and triangular shaped.  It seemed to be pointing in an easterly direction...as they lay there discussing it for at least another minute.  They watched the object slowly rotate (as if on an axis) in the completely opposite direction (west) - making no noise and showing no fuel trails- and then it was just gone.  (MUFON 59404)",

      "story": "Craft in Lexington, teardrop shaped, near University of Kentucky, appearing to children. Summer of 1993  Just after Lunch; 12 Noon \u2013 1pm   Not sure how I feel about sharing my story but it happened and changed my life. I was only 10 years old, I was at my friend ((female friend's name deleted)) house and we were inside playing hide and go seek.  We were scolded for being to loud and were sent outside to play.  Seems like all summer long we sat drawing with sidewalk chalk, as we sit in the drive way a shadow came over us.  There were no large trees and it was a clear day.  We looked at each other and then looked up.  What we saw sounds crazy at best. It was a large tear drop shape craft.  It was about; 20-25 feet long, 12-15 feet wide, and I couldn\u2019t tell the height but it would have been large enough for full grown adults.  It was like liquid metal, we couldn\u2019t see ourselves in the reflection but it was a mirror like silver.  It also had a ripple like a stone tossed into water.  It didn\u2019t make any noise.  There was no heat coming off it.  It just hung there; if we would have reached up, we could have touched it.  It was only 6-7 feet off the ground. We were kind of in a state of shock, I guess, because we didn\u2019t move or say anything.  But to a kid, I guess it was confusing.  But then we snapped out of it and started screaming, we were so loud that ((female friend's name deleted)) parents ran out to see what was going on.  Just as we started screaming, the craft took off, high and fast, towards Nicholasville Rd, as we were on University Ave.  We were pointing and trying to explain what happened, but her parents couldn\u2019t or didn\u2019t see it and it seemed to stop and watch as we tried to explain what was happening.  We were pointing at it as it sat there for a moment; it was reflective so it matched the blue sky.  You could only see it if you knew what to look for I guess. We were scolded for scaring everyone and making up a story.  ((female friend's name deleted)) had to go inside, and I was sent home.  I ran back to my house on Crescent Ave. screaming for my mom.  She heard me and met me outside trying to calm me down.  My mom tried to calm me down and I didn\u2019t know anything about UFO, but my mom actually said to me, \u201cIt was probably just a weather balloon.\u201d  I remember thinking this wasn\u2019t a balloon.  She got me inside, and she was cooking dinner but we had just had lunch.  I don\u2019t know the time but it wasn\u2019t normal.  I was confused and scared, for a long time.  ((female friend's name deleted)) and I were never allowed to play together again.  Her family thought that I was putting stories that gave her nightmares. I started having problems sleeping as well; I was sleep walking, having horrible dreams, and having sleep paralysis.  On several occasions my mom saw me trying to walk outside in my sleep, she had to put locks on the doors that I couldn\u2019t reach.  When I couldn\u2019t get out the doors, I actually tried to go out the window.  According to her she asked me why I was trying to get outside, and I said because the blimp is out there.  I was having dreams of blimps chasing me and of my neighbors back yard being on fire.  I couldn\u2019t scream though I tried no sound would come out. I couldn\u2019t move.  When I was finally able to I would start screaming out of control.  After I told my mom that she decided I needed to go to the doctor.  My primary care said I needed a therapist and a sleep study.  I started fearing everything; like shower curtains, heights, darkness, and I feared going to sleep so bad that I would stay awake for days.  I was awake so long that I would start seeing things and becoming mo! re fearful. I was taken to the Woodland Group in Lexington to see a therapist.  I really liked the guy, he had a labyrinth in his back yard.  The started doing hypnosis on me to see what got me so worked up.  He put headphones on my ears and the music would go back and forth left to right in my ears.  He also had me follow a light left to right until I got tired, not asleep just tired.  The only thing I remember him telling me to touch my face when I was scared and that it would relax me.  It worked and I got over my fears, sometimes I still catch myself touching my face in specific spots.  I also still have sleep paralysis, but it doesn\u2019t scare me anymore. When I stop and think about that night, I feel at peace now.  I can\u2019t remember something about a slender figure that opened his arms and seem to hold me.  It was like he cared about me and wanted me to know that.  I think I recall everything being white and sooth. Later in life I became a Deputy (law enforcement officer) and I worked with a Deputy that was stationed at Area 51 as a test piolet, in the 50s.  He has passed away now, but I always wonder why he decided to tell me about a missing aircraft that occurred when he was there.  I don\u2019t know why this always occurs around me.  But it worries me that no one seems to understand this was real, it happened and I don\u2019t know how to convince people to understand me.  My family jokes about it, one time I got real serious and spoke to my mom about it all as an adult.  Her story changed she said it was probably something the local University made and was flying.  If we had that technology then why hasn\u2019t it come out yet, it\u2019s not us.",

It was black with no lights and I was only aware of it because it was a bit darker than the sky because of the full moon.  As it traveled across the sky, there was the faintest of sounds, but it wasn\u2019t the sound of an engine or any thing like that.  It was the sound of air being pushed out of the way, like if you were spinning something heavy in a circle using a rope.  It traveled across the sky as far as I could see southwest to as far as I could see northeast before disappearing across the rooftops.  I have no idea about the size because I couldn\u2019t judge altitude.  It appeared to be large and far away, not small and close.  It travelled about 3 miles in 8-10 seconds, which would mean a speed of over 1000mph, but there was no sonic boom.  I\u2019m a 52 year old software developer with pilot training and good eyesight.  I have no idea what I saw.  Definitely not a plane, not a drone.  Not a flock of birds.",

I still thought it was a heli but as it got closer the lights were FORSURE not of a helicopter.  It was 1 bar of lights that had the bent shape of a gibbons moon. The lights were red and white.  They were NOT blinking but flashed like a strobe. I jerked myself up out of bed and ran to my window and noticed that whatever was in the sky was making NO SOUND. ***it's important to know that sound is actually perceived louder at night. I barely got a good look at it before it swept by out of my view. It was hard to make out the shape around these lights.  It's even harder to remember even though I am typing this only 20 minutes after seeing it.  My best guess after I first saw it was a drone.",

On July 27th my wife and I were stargazing hoping to see some shooting stars in field just south of Clearfork Reservoir near Lexington, Ohio.  The location was perfect with very little light pollution along with clear skies.  At approximately 1:30 am I thought I saw what would have been the brightest shooting star I have ever seen entering Earth\u2019s atmosphere, originating from the southwest on a bearing of 045 and 30 degrees above the horizon.  The object continued to get brighter and just as I was expecting it to flame out the speed immediately slowed to that of a commercial jetliner and the brightness of a normal star.  It continued along a straight line for 5-6 seconds before instantly accelerating to full speed and previous brightness as it left Earth\u2019s atmosphere.  To be clear, the object flew in the same path and was visible for approximately 7 seconds in its entirety. I am a former pilot who from The Ohio State University flight school.  As a pilot, it is imperative to understand what you are seeing and normal phenomena.  I honestly thought this would be the only time I wouldn\u2019t be able to explain a sighting only to be proven wrong, two months later.  2 0f 2 to follow",
