      "story": "Triangle shaped, 3 lights flashing red from a distance, looked like a bright star in the sky I was walking home from dinner with sister my 9 year old daughter.  We live one block from the beach in Fort Lauderdale.  There are multiple ways to go home but it was such a beautiful night we decided to walk along the beach last night.  My daughter saw a VERY BRIGHT STAR (as we were walking north towards our home).  My sister jokes that it\u2019s not a star but a planet. We saw another similar looking star not far away start to move -?we assumed it was a plane because we are about 20 minutes from the airport. However the airport is South of us & remember we are headed north.  No big deal at the moment... then the bright star began to move we thought it was our imagination so kept walking home.  My sister has a headache so we rushed back to our condo because friends were coming to meet us by the beach.  As I was coming out of my bathroom my sister screamed that as our friends were walking along the beach to us (2 miles south) they captured glowing flying objects in the! sky - our friend happens to believe in aliens & UFOs.  All of us do, however we didn\u2019t assume that\u2019s what they were at first.  We went back to the beach out of curiosity. All 3 of us climbed into a life guard stand facing the ocean to get a better look - sure enough we saw the flying glowing wings objects overhead.  One few over us and we could clearly see 3 lights in a triangle formation.  The lights looked read from a distance (almost like a ball of fire that has been contained).  They seemed to communicate with us on the ground & to each other through these lights.  The strange thing is that none of these large objects made any sound - we have the Airshow every April in Ft Lauderdale & it is extremely loud & noisy.  Furthermore, one object would stop & literallyvresemble a very bright star then wait for a few more to meet up & move together in unison.  No matter how many of these objects were in the sky at once... we watch from my balcony facing the intercostal an hour later - ! they never crossed paths. We took 5 videos on social media sho! wing pro of of these lights .  I watched other videos on YouTube & various news sources from others.  They look EXACTLY the same as ours.  This went in for 3 hours. Then we noticed they appeared to be landing behind the Las Olas bridge one after another. I would say without exaggeration at least 25-30 kept waiting them disappear and another one would show up. The oddest thing was before we left the beach there was a silent one that started water skiing it was also silent but had the 3 lights & it changed shape.  Since all we had were street lights... I could see waves follow it however it was completely quiet. Nobody water skis with only 3 small lights at 11pm.  That isvwhen they sharks come out. We know what we saw...  it was exhilarating yet mysterious.  We didn\u2019t feel that there was any harm meant for us.  Now with all these other sightings world wide I would like some answers please & Thabk You for reading my report if you made it this far.  Cheers.",

I was about 12 or 13 at the time.  I was riding my bicycle up and down the street in our apartment complex, which was approx. 1/3 of a mile long.  From the North end of the street a \"classic flying saucer\" came hovering over the tree line about 40 to 60 feet high. It was like right out of the movies, a metallic disc with colored lights rotating around it (I'm colorblind so sorry I can't tell you the colors).  Diameter was about 30 to 40 feet, 10 to 15 feet in height symetrical top and bottom.  It made no noise. At the time I was not scared, but only interested and I followed it from one end of the street to the other.  I literally road my bicycle under it the entire length of the street (1/3 mile) which it strangely hovered directly over seeming to follow the road.  I was easily able to keep pace with it so I estimate its speed at no more than 15 MPH.  At the end of our street I stopped and watched it continue on at the same pace.  Because of its low altitude it disappeared from view before to long. At that time the Goodyear blimp was a regular sight in Lauderdale and TV/movies portrayed UFO exactly like this one; so even at that young age I was skeptical, thinking that this was to good to be true.  I figured I would hear of a hoax or some explanation.  That never happened.  Now as I've grown older I realize the importance and significance of such a \"clear and close\" sighting.  I will try to send(email) more info(map and illustration), Thanx ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "object vented some type of vapor and left a cone shaped vortex when it left the atmosphere Two days before Hurricane Francis came ashore in south Fl. I was preparing my home and property for the storm. As I walked around my pool, I noticed off to the west what I thought was just a bright star and only looked at it for a second as I was quite busy. A few minutes later I thought to look at it again just because it was so bright. This time it appeared much closer so I watched it for a moment. It was a clear evening with just a few puffy white clouds moving to the west and I knew this was an object other than a star because it was moving to the east, towards my location. I called into the house for my wife and friend to step outside and watch the light. It got to within I would say a mile off where I was and it height was below the level of the clouds as I noticed one pass behind what ever it was I was looking at. It slowed to a stop and began to hover and then it went dark. We could tell there was something there but even with binoculars we could not make out the shape of the object. There was no sound that we could connect with the object but it was right in the middle of a large residential/commercial area and within a mile of the executive airport. What really got us a little freaked out about it was when the object began to expell some sort of mist or fumes that took the form of wings or some type of venting and both of the flumes, for lack of a better word, were huge. I estimate they were more than 100 yards one off to each side of the object. After 15 minutes or so, the craft moved off to the north and appeared to be going higher. As it disappeared out of site a cone shaped, I want to say vortex, appeared way up in the sky about where we last saw the craft. THe point of the cone was pointing towards space but angled off to the north a bit. I have no clue what this could have been but it was truly a life changing experience for me as it has truly opened my mind far beyond what I would have previosly considered within the realm of possibilities.

      "story": "1969 summer Ft. Lauderdale spiraling pinpoint of white light, spirals across the night sky with neon green cloud alongside. I was 15 and living with my married sister (26) while she was pregnant in a residential area of Fort Lauderdale, FL near the inter-coastal waterway. We went into her backyard, behind the pool to steal lemons off of her neighbor's lemon tree.  It was dark and a clear night. My sister exclaimed & grabbed my arm & pointed up towards the sky.  STRAIGHT UP was the brightest white light I'd ever seen (brighter than a Klieg light), a pinpoint of white light that spiraled out in lines that were so even they could have been made with a 'compass'... the pinpoint of light continued to shine as the spiraling lines filled the entire upper horizon... but what was odd is that we could see through the widening white, spiraling lines... we could see the starry sky through the widening white lines.  Next to the pinpoint of white light was a neon green cloud.  A cloud, like a white cloud you'd seen on a blue-sky day, except this cloud was green and it glowed like a green neon sign.  We both stood there with our mouths agape and watched this entire phenomenon for about 2 minutes... the white, transparent, WIDE spiral lines filled the entire upper horizon and then the white pinpoint just stopped emanating light and the green cloud took a few more minutes to fade away.  Apparently, thousands of people in Ft. Lauderdale saw this and called into police.  NASA claimed the next day that it was a 'reflection off of a rocket that was shot over the ocean... as the sun was going down.'  The only problem is, it was DARK, it was 8:30 PM and the sun sets on the Gulf/west side of Florida.  We were on the east side of Florida, quite close to the Atlantic ocean (perhaps 1 mile).  There was no way this was a reflection off a rocket as it was STRAIGHT UP and the pinpoint of light was emanating from above the earth (from space) and it shown down to the atmosphere where it spread out across the entire upper sky.  In my opinion, some superior visitors were taking a very large 'photo' of the area.  The green cloud was translucent.  The white spiral lines were transparent.  I work in the film business and there is no light we have today that is as bright as the pinpoint of very white light was.

I noticed lights in the sky just beyond the overpass, when I came to the other side of the overpass; I realized that this was not any airplane. I saw an object with four bluish lights on four corners, like the shape of a square or a cross. Since it was dark, I did not see the exact shape. The object was about 300 - 400 feet above the ground and it did not travel at the speed of an airplane, instead it hovered over a certain area. It caught my attention because it hardly moved. I drove directly underneath the object. It covered the two westbound lanes of the highway and half of the median. I continued on and did not stop because I got scared.

As I was lying out doors in my back yard on my back and looking directly straight up into the clear blue sky I noticed an illuminated thin straight line that appeared directly in my site of view. It shined for a second and looked like it was glass or metallic. At my first sight of the illuminated line it was vertical. It then switched to a horizontal position in a split second and was about 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch in length against the blue sky. I watched the horizontal illuminated perfect straight line tilt up on its right side and move up and down and to the left and to the right. Then I watched it tilt up on its left side and move around the same way. It moved with such speed and accuracy I have never seen anything like this before in my life. It then leveled off to a horizontal position, hovered for a second and then took off crossing the entire south side of the sky in a split second. It had easily covered a 180 degree angle if not more. The object was always a perfect straight illuminated line and never did it bend. It broke every law of physics regarding speed and flight capability. I am very lucky, honored and privileged to have experienced something of this magnitude in my life time. It was truly something that was NOT even close to being of this world or man made. The object sighting lasted for about 5.5 to 6 seconds. If one wasn\u2019t looking into this exact section/area of the sky at this exact moment one would not be able to see what I saw. It was not visible to all. You really had to be focused on that exact area. The speed of the object was like taking a laser pen and pointing it against a wall and moving it rapidly around up and down to the left and to the right. It was moving that fast in the sky. This is only something one could see if they were watching a sci- fi movie. The technology we have in our armed forces and in this world today are (stone- aged) compared to what I have witnessed and I would take a polygraph test 100 times just to prove what I saw was in fact real.   I am so happy and excited that I was able to witness such an extraordinary event in my life time and it was even on Easter Sunday 2007. Thank you,  MH",

This with light was very bright all around and under not just on the front.It was looking like a big ball of Crystal  We noticed it was moving from NW sky heading SE. It was moving at a steady speed and past just over the Fort Lauderdale airport and crossing the runaway  at maybe around 4 or 5000 feet in a steady slow speed (maybe 100Mph.)the size of the object was almost about half size of a regular commercial air line plane. No noise no green light no red light no withe strobe.  Something strange there s normally always many airplanes around that we can see  but during all the time about 3 minutes that this object was passing  there was no airplane around son after this object reach this ocean  we can see many airplane come back  around again. It was like if they were advise to not come around during the object was passing. Thanks for reading.  Jack scott    Here a copy of somebody who saw the same thing of me 10 minutes after over the Miami airport.    At approximately 8:15PM on 9/28/09 I walked out and as usual I looked up into the evening sky.  I observed a very bright light in the northeastern sky moving in a southerly direction. What made this unusual was the fact of how bright the light was. My first impression that is was an aircraft, since I live about 6 miles from the Miami International Airport. The best description of intensity of the light that I can describe is that of Venus in the night sky.  As I looked at it more closely, I could see no navigational markers (red, green or flashing strobe) visible. During the duration of the sighting I heard no noise from the object.  The speed of the object was that of a jet flying at altitude, but the altitude was much lower, maybe 10000 ft (but that is just a guess since it was difficult to determine since it was dark).  Living as close to the airport as I do, I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft. This object appeared to fly directly over Miami International Airport which is unusual again based on the objects apparent altitude. Another oddity observed was during the sighting no aircraft were visible either landing or taking off.  The object continued on its southerly course and made a turn to the east. Even when it made its turn the intensity of the light remained constant. IF it had been an aircraft I would have noticed its national markers. One other note was as I watched it make its easterly turn; I noticed an aircraft to the southeast and its navigational beacons where quite visible. Once it made its turn, I moved to follow the object but lost it between tress and other houses.",

Yesterday, 15-Sep-2008, at 7:30 pm EST, I was out in Fort Lauderdale's State Route A1A and Las Olas Blvd. beach, more precisely at Lat 26\u00b06'49\"N and Lon 80\u00b06'17\"W, getting ready to photograph the rising of the moon expected to happen from that point at Altitude 14.3\u00b0 and Azimuth 93.1\u00b0 E of N.  The sun at that time and location was at Altitude -17.7\u00b0 and Azimuth 281.8\u00b0 E of N. Slightly north of the moon's expected rising point, at about 80\u00b0 to 75\u00b0Azimuth, I saw what at first I thought were Venus and Mercury in a formation I saw two years ago in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, when Mercury was seen above and to the left of Venus in the city's southern night sky.  Yesterday's \"Venus,\" however, was unusually large, round and bright, and \"Mercury\" moved quickly in an up-and-to-the-left motion, right before I aimed my Sony DSC-F828 camera towards my \"planets\" and took several pictures, e-mailing separately:  DSC00066: At 7:39 pm \"Venus\" is bright and clear above a cloud formation that has two horn-like extensions on top.  \"Mercury\" is no longer white, it is now a yellow moving element as it moves away quickly in an up-and-to-the-left motion from its previous position above \"Venus.\"  Neither \"Venus\" nor \"Mercury\" have strobe red and bluish-white lights which would identify them as commercial aircraft, approaching FLL's international airport.  At the lower-left, another yellow light is seen. DSC00067: Still at 7:39 pm, \"Venus\" is at its same position above the cloud and the yellow light from DSC00066's lower-left area begins to move rapidly in an upward direction. DSC00068: Still at 7:39 pm, I zoom in into \"Venus\" and my camera's automatic focus, without clear referencing points, blurs the picture. DSC00069: Now at 7:40 pm, I still cannot get my camera to focus correctly, \"Venus\" has not moved from its original position. DSC00070: Still at 7:40 pm, I zoom out as \"Venus\" shoots up and to the left, caught here emitting white light from its bottom and yellow light from its top.  Two small lights to its right and one more small white light to its left suggest a wide, round, dish-like aircraft, producing a powerful white radiant light from its bottom and two also strong lights from its top. DSC00071: Still at 7:40 pm, \"Venus\" holds still before disappearing in a fast, upward motion. DSC00072: At 7:41 pm, that is the moon.",

It appeared to be far out to sea. (Eight or ten miles or more.)   At first I assumed it to be an approaching aircraft but it did't move at all which drew my attention. It was completely stationary, which is impossible even for a helicopter.  It was absolutely stationary for about 10 minutes, then another orb appeared as if it were a light being turned on. The second orb was identical to the first and appeared to the right and slightly higher than the first.  They both remained completely stationary in relation to the surface of ocean and to each other. No way these were stars.  It was still light out and slightly hazy and the objects were slightly above the ocean. There were literally thousands of people in and around the beach so others must have seen it.  I took a picture with a hi res SLR camera but the lights were so far out to sea that they look like two white dots then moved on.  A short time later I looked again but the lights were gone. This is the second time I have seen something weird in the sky.  The first was in 1986 or 1987 and that was a completely different object.  Wondering if anyone else on the beach saw these objects.

It was approximately 15-20 minutes before actual sunrise, when the sky was just lighting up, very clear out, we were standing in front of the Westin on A1A just north of Las Olas Blvd. We got to the water's edge and after a couple seconds I looked up and my eyes immediately fixated on something moving across the sky. It's very difficult to describe what we saw. The object was black - at first I thought it might be a bird very high up, but I couldn't discern any wings flapping, it just looked like a solid object moving slowly over the ocean, over and past us and continuing inland. There were no flashing lights, and as there were quite a few planes on the horizon, it was quite easy to see that this was not one of them. It was hard to focus on also, it seemed far away but quite low at the same time; for a second I actually thought it sort of looked like a person flying, but I dismissed this for obvious reasons. My girlfriend described it as \"an asymmetrical rectangular blob floating westward, not like a bird that varies direction and flaps its wings, but more like a balloon\". Very creepy, no sound at all, and again this thing flew in from the ocean, maybe 1,000 ft (?) up, and proceeded inland. There were several planes on the horizon, several miles away and clearly discernible as conventional aircraft. The object that passed above us most definitely was not.",

At a certain point, I noticed that a few clouds which had been disbursed and were not overlapping, finally became quite tightly knit together.  This,  I could tell because the light emitted revealed this. I had been watching them for miles.  All of a sudden, from this grouping of clouds which were intertwined came a beam of light in the shape of a tube/cone starting from the sky projected onto what seemed to be Ft. Lauderdale and this beam took the shape of a cone beam.  Larger at the bottom.  This lasted for about 2 seconds and retracted.  It did not just disappear, it retracted. Since it was at a distance, it was difficult to say whether it was over the ocean or land. At our angle on the freeway, above the rooftops but 1 mile South of Fort Lauderdale, this was difficult to determine.  I was driving with a friend who was visiting Florida and has absolutely no experience or interest in UFOs.  I asked her whether she was aware of what just happened.  Her response was sort of comical insinuating she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.  We were both waiting for the helicopter to appear and continue to shine its beam but it never happened and the beam was way to intense and wide to be from a copter.

The lights were white and moved together, slowly, toward the south. Further south, there was a single point of light that appeared to be a separate object.  That light was larger and brighter.  Briefly, a large flare (also white) seemed to follow the object. Although the flare implied speed, as if it were a tail of a comet, the object appeared to be moving slowly. The flare went away after a few seconds.  The objects slowly faded away as I watched them. They remained white and slow moving.  I attempted to shoot a video with my iPhone.

Time approximately 19:30 Looking south towards Miami two orange lights slowly moving east to west. Altitude approximately 250 feet. Distance approximately 1/2 mile. Continued in a western path for five minutes until lights disappeared into low cloud ceiling. Witnesses 3. Second event, June 09 2013 (If I remember correctly).  Time approximately 21:20 Once again, looking south towards Miami 15-20 lights moving west to east.  Altitude approximately 500-700 Ft. Distance approximately 1 1/2 - 2 miles. Although objects were not uniform (IE: triangle), they did not deviate from their own close proximity. If these objects were indeed chinese lanterns then someone had connected them with some sort of string, rope, or cordage, thus allowing a somewhat uniform appearance and movement. As an ex service member I can ensure these objects were not flares, as these object maintained their altitude for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing into the low cloud ceiling. Witnesses 2  Third event, April ? 2013. Looking north from same location. Time approximately 1630. Conditions partly cloudy. A white/light anomaly appeared (other witnesses claim seeing two side by side before I had come outside). Very very strange. Although anomaly appeared close, and conditions of full daylight, I could not gauge distance or altitude. Certainly not low level clouds reflecting sunlight. Still try to rationalize this event in my mind, but I cannot. When reflecting on this event it almost seemed like a dimensional anomaly. I honestly have no way of explaining this event rationally. Witnesses 4  I did not take down exact time, wind, or cloud ceiling conditions because, frankly, I never thought I would be filing a report on them. After hearing a report on Coast to Coast on 25 June 2013 of many events, I figured I should at least make a report on these events. This is coming from someone who has never witnessed any event prior to 2013, so to have 3 events in less than 6 mos is very odd.",

Below is the exact description I sent in an email to george noory of coast to coast am the evening after the incident which took place just after midnight on christmas night.  I decided to finally report this after hearing of so many other incidents that sounded almost exactly like mine which occurred more and more in the months and years after my experience and came to believe it may be related to the UFO phenomenon. On Christmas night I was sweeping my sons floor and I hear a huge explosion which scared me at first but I immediately assumed it was a large firework from someone messing around and continued sweeping but then immediately realized it was still making an after sound like when you hear the rumble of thunder after a big lightning strike.  It was loud enough to set off a bunch of car alarms and rattle my windows.  When I thought it was thunder I promptly ran outside thinking it might start pouring rain and I had to cover my motorcycle.   So I ran out there looked up and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.  It was one of the clearest nights you could ever find in south Florida.  It couldn't have been a lightning strike with a clear sky.  I know it wasn't fireworks because I know exactly what those sound like up close.   My only other thought was a sonic boom which I have heard before but there were no jets or jet sounds, I didn't even see any regular planes in the sky just stars and I looked very carefully.  My neighbors heard it to but no one had any idea what it was.   Just thought my story should be out there and wondering how many other people may have heard this boom.",

It was approximately the size of a full moon.  It looked to hold a constant altitude and was slowly moving north to south.  It was shaped like an oval on its side and had bright burnt orange light emanating from it.   The bands of light were roughly vertical and were moving from left to right on the object.  The light seemed to bend, with the ends of each band curving towards the center.  When the light bands were towards the left side of the object, the ends bent to the right.  When the lights had rotated to the right side of the object, the bands bent to the left.  As the light bands reached towards the center of the object they appeared vertical.   It was observed during the beginning of a lightning storm a few miles off the coast, just about where the Gulf Stream scoops and towards the coast.  After maybe 15 minutes it quickly faded and the disappeared, possibly into ! the clouds.  Shortly thereafter I heard choppers but saw no lights.  Very strange for around here as we have a lot of air traffic and to run without lights would be extremely risky.   I tried to snap a picture but considering it was with the camera phone the quality is very poor.

      "story": "Light beings bring ships onto sand @ Ft. Lauderdale Beach I was at Fort Lauderdale Beach with four of my friends, around 11 P.M., on February 12, 2016.  In the sky there was a lot of bright stars and what we thought was a planet.  This \u201cplanet\u201d gave off a light light that was shining so bright the surface of the ocean lit up.  There also seemed to be a large amount of incoming planes from over the horizon, which were also reflecting light off the water.  (Airplanes do not have lights that bright.) More \u201cplanes\u201d kept coming and they kept getting lower. \tWe soon realized that these were ships morphing into and disguising as our crafts. We could see it happening.  All of the lights began coming closer and brighter.  I saw the light that looked like a planet come from high in the sky to low and it slowly moved towards us.  Once it got close, it looked like a huge military ship, but it was translucent.  It gave off both blueish and redish glows.  Within the huge ship were several small light beings that seemed to control the ship.  They got so close that the ship was coming onto the sand.  We receded back to the parking lot and it kept coming closer. It remained hovering stationary for about 15-20 minutes. \tThis being was within 10 feet of us.  We didn\u2019t know what to do and we were all trying to process what we were seeing.  I was really worked up and excited. When I left, I felt like the beings had contacted me telepathically (but I can\u2019t speak for the others).  I didn\u2019t hear a voice, but it was like my brain received a message.  I knew that the thoughts I had about the way they felt came right from them. They told me they had the power to do ANYTHING and they are invincible.  They are light beings making contact with us because we attracted them to us.  They came in peace and I left with feelings of euphoria.",

So I'm looking at it trying to figure out whether it was a plane but it was originally not moving at all, just sort of hovering there.   I called my other friend who was visiting to come outside to see what he thought of it.  After he came outside it started maneuvering back and forth from right to left for around a minute.   After the back in forth motion, it started moving back and forth again but this time descending.  The motion this time was kind of odd.  It almost looked like it was a light on a pendulum being lowered.  This motion lasted for around another minute.

It so happened that I was about to read reports on NUFORC & read that there were other reports in our state of \"orange\" lights/spheres.  If I had read these reports before seeing the orange light, I would have watched it longer.  But again, it was not a red navigation light; it was clearly orange like orange fruit, & I could see other red navigation lights to reference as there were multiple aircraft in the area. I just wanted to point out that I'm an Air Force veteran & have witnessed the \"triangle UFO\" & I have witnessed a \"green fireball\".  Both incidences included multiple witnesses.  This \"orange light\" incident however was not as vivid & clear and therefore, it may have been an actual aircraft; however, I believe that taking the other similar sightings into consideration, that for a few reasons it would be better to report this incident.",

My friend was getting into his car at around 8:30-9:00pm, when he noticed something flying in the air.  He called me over and pointed toward the object he was watching and my eyes immediately fixated on it.  The object was very high in the sky and I live near the Fort Lauderdale airport so I know most aircrafts do not reach those altitudes when preparing to land or even after taking off.  Most airplanes I am familiar with never reach altitudes past 60,000 feet but the object had to have been up at least 100,000 feet.  The UFO appeared as a seemingly small, circular, reddish dot in the sky, it did not flash or glow.  It was traveling at relatively high speeds but that was the least interesting thing about it.   After we stood watching it for almost a minute, I pulled out my phone in an attempt to get real footage of what we witnessed.  I had an iPhone 6s Plus and the quality of the camera along with the height of the UFO made it impossible to capture due to the time ! of night.  (This has made me into more of a believer than before knowing that even modern day technology is barely capable of capturing something so astonishingly high in the sky.)  It made no audible sounds possibly because of its altitude.   We watched the object continue across the sky until we noticed another exactly similar one!  They were flying towards each other until they got very close to one another.  I knew this was beyond human capability, because one UFO (the second one to be spotted) came to an abrupt stop.  The UFO we originally seen continued on after they had crossed paths for approximately 5-10 seconds.  We watched in amazement and curiosity as the second UFO stopped moving as if it had spotted us!  It shot a white, star-colored dust into the air which dissipated very quickly, which after deep thought, we believe to be a thruster of some sort because the second UFO vanished moments later.   In total, we witnessed about 2 minutes of seemingly unexplainable activity happening thousands of feet above us.  My only dream now is to make contact with those potential life forms as I find humans intolerant or ignorant to the concept of extraterrestrial life inhospitable.  Please do not take this as a joke, there is clear, consistent evidence of extraterritorial contact being covered up by governments around the world.  If there is any way I could assist the NUFORC or MUFON team in proving other-worldly existence, please reach out to me!",

When I first saw it I was probably only seeing the wing of it.It was north of me,moving towards the west.  There seemed to be light in the front of the right wing.  Not a light like on a plane.  It was more like a glow.  I also thought I saw  piping in the shape of coils in an octagon shape taking up most of the space on what could be called the right wing.  Again, it all was hard to see because it was the color of the night sky.It almost looked transparent.  As it got further away, I it looked like a v standing upright, just floating away till it was too far away to see.  I saw no  blinking lights or heard no engine sounds.  The object was large enough to take up most of the sky line when it was directly north of me.  It seemed to be moving slowly.  As it moved to my right I saw the back of it.  It was just black and thin.  In the shape of a v.  It seemed to be very low in the sky.",
