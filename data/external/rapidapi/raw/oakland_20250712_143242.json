      "story": "Bright light in woods moves toward witness; witness was left disoriented. I think that this happened in the spring/summer of 1982. It might have been 1983, but I am pretty sure that I had just completed my first year of college and I have a vague memory of feeling irresponsible about missing too many days of work at my part-time job. I have to admit that I can't pin this down exactly. I know it happened no earlier than 1982 and no later than 1984. There were green leaves on the trees; the temperature was neither particularly hot nor cold.  I had a close friend who was several years younger. I think I was 19-20 years old, so she was 16 or 17. Her father was a boy scout troop leader, and he, her mother, and other adults were taking their troop camping at Swallow Falls State Park, near Oakland, Maryland. (Here is the url for more information: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/western/swallowfalls.html.) She was a bit of a problem teen, and there was no way that her parents were going to let her stay home alone while they took the troop to Swallow Falls. She had to go, but they told her that she was allowed to bring a friend. She asked me and I agreed to go along.  Looking at the Swallow Falls camping maps, I believe that we camped in the Youth Group Loop. I\u2019m not sure exactly where on the loop we were positioned (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/msfmap.html), but my gut tells me we were in camp site number 2 (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/sfyg.html). I am sure that no one was in camp site 3, but I am not clear if any one was in camp 1. I have no recollection of seeing any other campers outside our party during the entire trip.  The camping loop went fairly deep into the forest of huge old trees. On the first night, there was a heavy rain storm. My friend and I were sleeping on the ground in a small two-man tent. We were utterly miserable; our tent was damp and leaking. It kept raining into the next day, and in fact, by the evening, it was absolutely pouring. We decided to spend the night in her father's car. It was parked facing the loop road, next to the encampment. My friend, who was a tiny person, took the backseat, and I planned to sleep in the driver's seat in recline.  I recall that we sat in the car talking for hours while the rain pounded the car. I don\u2019t remember thunder or lightning, just driving rain and some winds. I don\u2019t think the car had a lighted clock. (Now that I think about it, I\u2019m not sure cars had lighted clocks in the early 1980s.) But I guess it was around midnight.  At some point while we conversed, I noticed a light through the front windshield.  I can remember that it illuminated the hard streaks of rain hitting the glass.  We both stopped talking, so I assume that she also saw the light. I never turned my head to look at her in the back seat as the light wended its way toward us. It was yellow-greenish and about as bright as a car headlight pointed full on very bright. It did not have a defined shape because of this brightness, but I assume its core was round. It moved smoothly, about 3-5 feet from the ground, swerving gently a few times to avoid trees. I remember wondering whether it was a car on the muddy loop coming from camp 1. Then I thought, \"Maybe it\u2019s someone walking with a really bright lantern.\"   My last memory of the light is as it reached the front of our car.  I retain an image of it crossing in front of us, as if it was going to follow the loop out of the woods to the parking area.  But I can\u2019t recall it actually doing that.  I think I saw it start to illuminate the tents that were to my right.  The next thing I remember is disorientation then turning around to my friend to say, \"That was weird.\" The two of us immediately picked up our conversation from before the light appeared.  After that night in the woods, I didn\u2019t think about the odd light for years. I don\u2019t recall ever mentioning it to anyone until the early 1990s, when I read a description of ball lightning.  How it can glide and make unusual maneuvers. I decided that was what we had seen and mentioned it to my husband and friends.  When I was in my 30s, my friend visited from Arizona, where she then lived. I asked her if she remembered that night in the car. She did, except for the light. In her memory, we sat in the car talking in the driving rain until we fell asleep.  Now, after another decade of consideration, I\u2019m no longer sure what I saw was ball lightning and lean more toward a UFO-type experience or that I am simply misremembering an event with a rational explanation: a car; a camper.  I have to rule out it was a vehicle for several reasons. First, there was only one light, not two, although I concede it could have been a car with one headlight. But I don\u2019t remember a car. Second, the only source for a car would have been camp site 1. From where I sat, site one would have been at approximately 1 o\u2019clock. I would have been at roughly 7 o\u2019clock. My memory is of the light coming toward us from about 10 o\u2019clock, out of the woods. I don\u2019t remember seeing camp site 1 occupied. If it was, and this was a car from that site, why would they drive the long way around the unpaved, muddy loop in the storm to exit into the parking area?  Was it a person with a lantern? It might have been someone armed with an incredibly bright light, but I don\u2019t remember a person. I\u2019ve wondered if it was someone from camp site 1 walking to the toilets. I personally have no memory of the bathhouse that is shown on the youth group loop detail, however, a site 1 camper would again be taking a very long route to get to the toilets, through driving rain on a muddy trail.  I also wonder about the disorientation I felt. I don\u2019t know exactly what time it was when the light appeared, so I don\u2019t know if we were missing time, but something felt wrong. I also wonder why my friend and I never discussed it, and why I barely recalled the incident until I read the description of ball lightning years later. I don\u2019t remember any other experiences that could be construed as abductions. Perhaps they were coming for her? We had a falling out in the late 1990s and no longer are in touch or I\u2019d ask her if she has had further experiences. Aliens? A one-headlight car? Another camper? Ball lightning? I don\u2019t know what I saw that night and I never will, I suppose. It\u2019s been bothering me so much recently that I thought I should file a report.

(Actually So-East.) 208 runs from Oakland through Franklin Lakes then Wyckoff, Hawthorne, Glen Rock and Fair Lawn.  Through the front windshield I spotted an unusual object roughly triangular in shape ahead and to the left. It was daylight and the object was easily seen though quite small. I would guess it was maybe 1 to 2 miles high. There was a lot of rush hour traffic, especially in the opposite lane and I would guess it was seen by many others.  As I travelled through Wyckoff the object shifted more to my left due to my movement. The object did not appear to be moving but I could not detect its motion due to my own.  By the time I was in Hawthorne, still on 208, the object was off to my left, and it was closer to me. It somewhat resembled a tent with 2 'lines' hanging below it. I don't mean lines like a kite, but short lines dangling just below it.  I finally went passed it and had to turn my head up and back to the left to see it and it finally was too difficult to drive and look at the same time.  It was too high to be a kite, and resembled nothing I had ever seen in the sky before. It did not appear to be a hot-air baloon. That thought didn't even occur to me at the time.",

I turned and saw a dark object as big as a helicopter hovering over the park. It was silent and less than a quarter of a mile up in the sky. There was this belt of tiny irregular-flashing lights that would move around this big, dark oval object.  The UFO started to go higher in the sky and it moved slowly back and forth like how you could swing a pendulum.  It was now about half a mile in the sky and gradually started to move North-East towards Berkeley. Never have I seen something like this before. It was shocking, and I want to know if anybody else saw it. I\u2019m glad I found this website to share this sighting of a UFO which I always thought was as a funny thing until this past Monday night, it is now certainly no joke to me.

My friend, her boyfriend and i were talking previously about a movie they had just went and seen, just then, my friend looks up into the sky and ask's me \"is that a plane?\" i looked up into the sky and i saw a disk shape figure, and it had yellow/orange lights moving from left to right going at a medium speed. i thought to myself that could be a plane, but planes have lights that guide it to where its going. there was no light and there was no movement. it just stayed in one place. and i asked her \"is that a u.f.o?\" and she kept tellin me she dont know she dont know... so then i looked at it more, i stared at in staying in one place. and i seen the whole shape of it.. it was like a disk with an upside down U on it. i remember i kept staring at it even when the light turned green, i stayed. All of a sudden the shape started lowering, not like it was landing like a plane, because a plane goes to land in strait forward line, this object was hovering in one place with it circleing, and then it started dropping real slow. strait down. my friends boyfriend, in the back seat kept telling us we were lying, but he opened his door and stuck his head out of the car, and saw the u.f.o also. he seen how scared i was and he told me to drop him off where we were, and he got out the car, as i turned the corner out of the gas station, i looked to see if the object was there and it was gone. it dissapeared. i believe this was a u.f.o. I have seen show's about u.f.o's and i heard they only go on the other half of the united states.. and they go to farms... but this is oakland, CALIFORNIA... no farms... no open area, just the regular city. and also, there was no planes in the sky, tjere was no noise like a plane, and this object was really close to us... enough to see the exact shape of the object.",

It was dark and cold, and the road I was driving on is near a park area. There have been many deer accidents on this road, so I always go cautiously especially after dark.  While scanning the empty fields on both sides of the road, I noticed a fireball in the sky to my left. It was very large. Behind the ball of fire, was a tail. I believed it to be a meteorite, but had never seen one so large. A shooting star, it wasn't. I slowed down to about 20-30 miles an hour.  The road was dark, and no other travelers either way. I should have stopped the car, but knew there was no place to pull over. I watched the road and the fireball. The fields on the left had been harvested, so my view was clear. The fireball was going the same direction as I was, perpendicular to the road.  I watched it for about 3-5 minutes. The fireball went behind some distant trees, then it was gone. I believed it to crash. There were also 3 blinking \"strobe like white lights\" ahead of the fireball, which I assumed to be on towers of some kind in the distance. The fireball crashed before these lights.  I haven't been able to locate these strobe lights since. I looked for them, knowing they would be my reference point.  A few weeks later I saw on the news that Canada had a meteor crash to the ground. From the video that they showed,  it looked exactly like what I had seen...except mine was more red and orange. Also in the Canadian video, the ground and sky lit up on impact. My fireball did not make any light when it hit the ground.

Out of nowhere a gigantic, extremely bright circular blue light appeared over the Piedmont cemetary.  It was so bright and sudden that we both at the same time said \"Whoah what is that!\"  It was easy to see the light there because the cemetary is one of the only areas in the cityscape that is completely black at night.  At first i thought it could be cops in the cemetary shining lights or a helicopter, but after about 1 second it was obvious that it was neither. The light was huge, bright blue, circular, and had defined edges. It even lit up some of the trees directly around it. Then for a split second it looked like there could be two circles.  This only lasted for about 3 seconds and just as fast as the huge light had appeared it disappeared.  Then the weirdest part happened.  About 1-2 seconds after the circle(s) disapp! eared, another blue circle (or possibly the same one) appeared at least one mile away to the south.  This time it was merely a flash for about one second after which it disappeared for good.  I cant stress how huge and bright blue this circle of light was, and how defined its shape was.  Looking at the view it was about the size of one of the houses around it.  I couldnt see any sort of craft, just the bright solid light light.

Also thought it could have been a falling star but too low to the ground.  The date and time of this sighting is Feb. 1, 2009 7:38 p.m. PST.  Clear night sky and a little over a quarter moon.   There were aircraft flying much higher and farther away in the sky (very probably approaching or departing S.F. International or Oakland International airports).

We were standing on his front porch looking out smoking a cigarette looking at Oakland from his house.  At first I thought it was a radio tower or a building that we had never saw.  But the light remained motionless for a couple minutes.   Then it began to slowly rise and glide through the sky.  Then it began to turn and come our way.  At that time I thought it was a helicopter because the shape was elongated from the side view with a white light near the front and a red flashing light near the back of the object.    Then it made its way closer to use and I saw what appeared to be the underside of the rectangular oval object and there were two white lights in towards the middle of the object and four red lights symmetrically aligned on the edges of it.   The saucer at that point was no more than a couple hundred feet away from us and in the air gliding without making any noise what so ever.  We sprinted down the street to follow where it was going but the terrain eventually made it impossible to see where it was going.",

This day, January 30, 2010 at approximately 19:00 hours, I as well as two others were witness to a UFO flying overhead. At the base of the Oakland Hills, myself as well as three other friends, were on the outdoor deck of a penthouse on the fourth floor of an apartment building. Our focus was on the horizon just over the hills due to the reason that a friend mentioned that the moon rises so quickly at night over the hill. While we were waiting as we observed the glow of the moon thru the fog rolling over the hill, two of the three friends went into the house (the residents of the apartment.) I remained outside because at 25 years of age I had never witnessed the moonrise before. While the other and myself were anxiously waiting for the moon to peak over the hill he shouted, \u201c A UFO, a UFO!!!\u201d I immediately looked to where he was pointing and I saw a triangle shaped object. It was three translucent reddish-colored orbs in a symmetrical \u201cpyramid\u201d shape. The top! of the triangle, the point, was at the head of the direction it was moving. It was moving at a higher rate of speed at an altitude higher than that of planes that regularly fly over the same area. Its rate of speed during the sighting never wavered. It remained at a constant speed throughout the sighting. At the time it was in our field of view, there was not one other plane or object in the sky. The only things in the sky in view were the stars. When he shouted, the male resident of the apartment raced out to the deck (back patio) and immediately saw the UFO. He was the only one who said he \u201cheard\u201d it. Myself as well as the other fellow who first observed the object did not hear anything. It was just \u201cgliding\u201d thru the sky. I have never seen anything like it. It was funny or odd to me that several minutes after the sighting, as we were all in amazement of what we had just observed, I noticed the sky began to fill up with airplanes flying overhead. This was odd to me due to the fact that when the UFO was in the sky there were no other objects present except the sky and stars. Several seconds soon after the UFO traveled out of our field of view, is when planes began to fly in their respective patterns overhead.",

I was looking at the stars facing southwest, when something caught my eye. I quickly looked over and in 1-2 seconds I saw 4 lights moving at an incredible speed past the roof of my house. I quickly ran around to the side of the house to see what it was. For the next 2-4 seconds I clearly saw 3 lights forming a triangle speeding across the sky directly south. There was also a light right in the middle of all 3. There was a large distance between the lights, because at the speed they were moving, they stayed in perfect unison probably 5-6 miles apart from each other. I'm not sure whether or not these were rim lights to some large craft, but it seems unlikely since the distance between them stayed in a perfect triangle. If this is the case, the craft must have been absolutely huge. The speed of this object was approximately (and I'm guessing here) 10-15x faster than the airplanes I observed in the sky over the SF Bay Area during the minutes after the sighting. I can't stress enough that this thing was moving INCREDIBLY FAST!  The night sky during the event was very hazy, with the lights from San Francisco making it hard to see the stars. I lost sight of the object in the haze traveling southward. The lights also appeared to be speeding up. For the past year, I lived outside the city, and saw many shooting stars during the night and early morning. I am absolutely certain that these lights were not shooting stars.

I live in the center-most area of my city (Oakland, Ca) and according to Google satellite my street is 400 ft elevated (I live on a hill).  The orb looked as if it was roughly between 10 and 20 thousand feet off the ground,. I was standing on top of a chair, and with doing so it looked like it was in my direct line of sight, but way across town (I was facing NW).  It seemed to be getting brighter then it would dim out then come back, and it was moving up and down very slowly, then it would stay it one spot. The size of it was small compared to the moon, but large compared to a star.  I saw another orb appear that was not bright as the first, and it slowly drifted towards the first orb making its way directly on top of it.  It then stayed then and got very bright, so bright that they almost looked like one.  The second orb then dimmed out )but! still visible) about a minute later and drifted away in the same direction it was going and disappeared (it went in a straight line).  I zoomed in with my camera and the shape of the object looks like a geometric Pac-man shape.  The original orb stayed in the sky for about 20 minutes (that I saw of it that is)  periodically dimming out then getting bright again. Eventually it drifted slowly away and disappeared.",

Heading west towards the bay. By the time I got my camera out it was in front of the sun. it was climbing in altitude and slowly turning north.

Report #2 Last Friday, July 9th at around 1pm, I witnessed an aircraft hovering in the sky for a few minutes while speaking with Evva.  I thought it was hovering at a height much higher than consistent with commercial airliners landing or having just taken to the sky. I was standing at 1390 Grand View Drive in Berkeley and it seemed like the aircraft was directly above us.  The color of the aircraft was dark brown or black and shaped like a perfect cylinder, with neither any tapering at either end or anything resembling the wings of an airplane.  The end of the aircraft looked like the color chrome, but that may have been the sunlight glinting off of it.  Based on the altitude I estimate the aircraft was hovering at, it seemed like it's size was much larger than a commercial aircraft. After a few minutes, the aircraft reoriented itself from an original position consistent with the hull of an airplane flying horizontally to one flying vertically, while still holding almost the exact same position in the sky.

I was driving northwest on I-580 between Park blvd. and Lakeshore Ave.  While exiting onto Lakeshore, I saw 4 very bright orange lights in the sky to the west, heading southeast toward me.  My first reaction was that they were a string of planes on their way to land, which is a common sight in the bay area.  They were below the cloud cover, which is relatively low (touches the hilltops), but I couldn\u2019t see any sort of shape to them.  A fourth that was hanging back abruptly caught up, bobbing ad looping as it went. At this point I had run through all the options.  Based on their speed, I am convinced they were \u201caircraft\u201c, but  they were making turns and altitude changes that appeared unearthly.  They started to turn to the east rather quickly, at which point I couldn\u2019t look anymore, considering I was driving.  After finding a parking spot, I ran out of the car and looked up, only to find one craft slowly moving west to east.  As it sat in the sky, I got a good look at it: Orange orb with yellow edges, no apparent solid shape.  It was larger than Jupiter in the night sky, but definitely smaller than the moon.  It jogged around for a second then seemed to go straight up, fading out through the cloud layers. I saw two men talking where I had stopped, and when they separated I pulled one over to look at what I was seeing.  He was somewhat interested, but figured it was a helicopter and walked back inside his home.  Well, after what I saw, I can safely rule out helicopters, airplanes, or anything inanimate like &quot;Chinese lanterns&quot;.  These things were moving all over the place in their flight path, and were at times going faster than the F-18's that were flying over for the 4th of July.  It was surreal to see the way they moved, it is difficult to put into words. I never thought I would see something like this over my home town.",

This object was floating about two miles away and was relatively close to the earth in comparison to an airplane that was also flying near by.  At first, I was convinced that it was a kite or something, but as it came nearer it became obvious that it wasn't a kite or balloon or anything that could float for so long on its own.   We stood watching it in the parking lot of a Home Depot for about 5 minutes as it came directly above us.  It was clearly a very, very flat surface and was actually moving quite slowly, as if being carried by the wind.  Yet, the air was still and there was no strong wind whatsoever to propel it.  It tettered back and forth from side to side, but for the most part, we could only see the bottom of the aircraft. We watched it until it was out of sight. It was still very light outside, yet no one else seemed to see it.",

Appeared to be very high in the sky and remained in a relatively fixed position.  At first it appeared to be a thin line of reflected light but changed to more of a pinpoint after several minutes.  Wife also watched after the first two minutes and both of the couple watched the light hover high in the sky above Oakland for about 30 minutes.  During that time it moved position only slightly - drifting roughly north west.  Two other lights appeared and approached the first light during the time it was hovering and then gradually disappeared by apparently moving higher into the atmosphere out of sight of the couple. Honestly, as wife did not see initial appearance of the light she was skeptical about the origin of the object in spite of the fact that it remained essentialy stationary high above the sky of the Oakland Zoo, suggesting theories of weather balloons, etc. as the origen of the light.  However, after watching the object appear as a shiny stationary dot for approximately 30 minutes she was startled to see the light thin to a white line and then disappear in a bright flash.  The entire event took place in a clear blue sky above a very active air space and normal planes with contrails passed far below these lights throughout the event.  The sudden appearance and disappearance of the object as well as its apparent ability to remain stationary high in the sky was extremely unusual.",

I was talking to my neighbor and glanced to the east.  I noticed a big orange/red ball.  I asked my neighbor what that was, and he said probably a firework, since someone was shooting off a few in the distance from where we were, and we could see them.    We kept watching silently.  We noticed it was moving towards us. When it was passing, I told him that wasn\u2019t normal.  He said no it wasn\u2019t.  We both said we have never seen anything like it.  It had no sound, nor a tail.  I viewed it very well.  It didn\u2019t have a white glowing light nor an open place in the bottom like Chinese lanterns have. I got an excellent view of the east, north, west and bottom of this object.  IT HAD NO OPENINGS WHATSOEVER!  Brilliant orange red color.  I did focus on it\u2019s rim after it passed by me to see if I saw anything emitting from the sides.  I did see a little energy, one might call it. My close up look revealed that it did not flicker like most you tube videos of orbs do.  It was very bright, but didn\u2019t hurt my eyes at the moment looking at it.  I didn\u2019t have to squint like looking at the sun makes one squint.  It was a big ball traveling across the sky.  It seemed to be intelligently controlled in my opinion.   I have not ideal what I saw, but I can tell you in my opinion what I  believe it wasn\u2019t due to the close up view I got of it.  It has been suggested it was a Chinese lantern.  I have looked at Chinese lanterns on you tube.  There is no comparison to what I observed.  There was no white light.  It was perfectly round like the moon.  I know it was not a falling star, nor a piece of space junk that fell from orbit.  I witnessed a piece of Russian space junk falling and it looked like a plane on fire with a long tail.   This orb looked more like a ball of energy, perhaps one might say an orange round moon traveling.  The color was not flickering.  I didn\u2019t see any white or black spots.  The color seemed the same all over, just brilliantly colored.   I didn\u2019t see a triangle or any other shape within or outside of it.  I observed it long and close enough to honestly say in my opinion it wasn\u2019t a Chinese lantern which skeptics want one to believe. There is a place that makes flares on the east side of Oakland.  I sometimes see them testing early in the morning off in the distance from our house.  They fall down.  I\u2019ve seen enough of those to know it wasn\u2019t a flare.  Besides it was on a Sunday night, and I\u2019m sure they were closed.  They don\u2019t travel at a constant speed and altitude either. As the object traveled past, I didn\u2019t feel any weird feelings within my body.  I probably wouldn\u2019t of noticed any weird feelings since I was so fixated on the object in question.  Again, it had no openings on the east, north, west nor bottom of object.  I could see it most clearly.  If it landed on top of the house or in front of me, I could not have viewed it any better. I called the National Weather Service in Memphis, Tennessee this morning.  The gentleman said the surface winds were out of the east at 10 mph.  Speculating winds aloft were out of SE 500 feet and above.  He said they didn\u2019t keep a record of winds aloft, so he was going by what it has been lately with winds out of the east.  I didn\u2019t like hearing winds out of the east, because that doesn\u2019t help me with my case as to what I actually viewed.  The skeptics reading my report will suggest it was a Chinese lantern, which in my opinion clearly wasn\u2019t.   Before saying that I would say it was a ball of energy coming from the fireworks.  I feel so strongly it wasn\u2019t a Chinese lantern due to the great views I had of it on the east, north, west and bottom sides. Whatever it was\u2026. The color was very pretty.  I don\u2019t see Chinese lanterns having such a brilliant orange / red color.  It wasn\u2019t like it was lit up inside an object.  The object was the light itself. Everything I have written is my honest opinion.  I will say the altitude of the object was perplexing to me.  I can\u2019t give you  an altitude, but I can tell you it was big enough and close enough for me to see everything I needed to see.",

Approximately 21:00 on Sunday 07-14-2013 I along with others my neighborhood in Oakland, Tennessee, observed an orange/red orb traveling at a constant speed and altitude.   I noticed someone had shot off a few fireworks in the far distance.  I saw a bright light between where the fireworks were being shot and where I was located.   At first we thought it was a firework.  As we watched it, we noticed it was moving towards us.  It seemed to be at a low altitude or either it was very big and gave that impression. It passed overhead and therefore I got a good view of it.  The orb was circular like the sun and moon.  It was very bright, but it did not cause me to squint to look at it as the sun does.  It didn't have a tail, nor make any sound. It didn't have any other colors in it nor did it flicker like the ones you see on you tube videos.   After it passed over, I made a point to look at the rim to see if I saw anything emitting around it.  I did notice a little energy, I guess you can call it, but only when I looked hard at the rim after it passed. It was not a Chinese lantern as some may suggest.  I got a good look at it probably between 2 and 3 minutes, especially when it passed overhead. I know it was not what has been suggested it might have been to me. I had no funny feeling in my body as it passed over, just amazement.   That happened night before last and tonight I have a sore throat, gee I hope that orb didn't give me something! :o)  I'm joking, but I'm also serious about that last statement!   If anyone has seen this orb or any other in Oakland, PLEASE report it to an online UFO reporting site.  I'm sure all of us that have had the opportunity to see one of these orbs would love to see how many others in Oakland and across the country that have actually gotten to see one.  I'm wondering if it is a good or bad thing seeing one...I'm honestly having mixed feelings. What are they?  Are they good, evil, just a ball of energy, a secret government! project or what?",

There was no precipitation.  I heard another person who was out on the street exclaim as I saw the second flash.

I saw no windows but multicolored lights circumnavigating the object like you would see on an outdoor theater displaying the features at the show.  The disc reminded me of a football shape.   I shouted at a guard passing on the same side of the street to come across the street and look up.  He witnessed it as well.   I ran down the stairs of the barracks to alert the watchman and by the time we both observed this object we saw it jet upwards at an angle with no sound and disappear into the night sky like an open shutter on a camera, leaving a trail of light behind it.

      "story": "Cigar shaped ufo seen falling to earth ion Oakland it was 1/8/15 at 0715 hrs in the morning.  I was having a cigarette scanning the sky looking in the eastern sky. I saw something at about 45 degree in the falling towards earth at a very sharp angle, like if it was the hands of a clock, it would be facing seven o clock. It was traveling incredibly slow.  So slow, that I didn't know whether this was a contrail from an earlier plane or whether it was moving.  I had to use the telephone wire as a reference marker to make sure it was moving.   Once I realized it wasn't a contrail, a plane flew near it, on its own trajectory, giving me an immediate reference to the movement of planes.  As it started falling past the tree limbs it did something really funny.  It seemed to have compressed, almost like an accordion into itself and seemed just hover in the sky.  Watching this sent chills down my spine because it's movement was one I have never encountered in my life.  It wasn't a meteor because the speed was too slow.  Nothing could just fall from the sky at the rate it was falling.  The velocity was just too slow.   And it wasn't a plane.  I took a video, buts it's poor in quality, but I did take a few photos that didn't turn out so badly.  Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in seeing them.

The sun had just set behind the buildings in front of me but there was still a lot of light outside.   I noticed in the sky something that was bright orange, almost fire like.  I thought it was a blimp, but it moved differently.  Its movement was fluid, not jerky, and it seemed to move around in all directions with great ease.  At one point It must have turned in an orbit, like a planet turns, because it seemed like the orange glow was a reflection of the sun off a silver looking sphere in the sky.   I took my phone out, took a picture, and then started recording it.  I recorded for about two minutes until it dissapeared.  The video goes blurry because the autofocus was on.   Initially when I saw the object, it seemed to hover at the hight of what planes fly at, but within two minutes it was so much higher.

I awoke at 6 am roughly in a field up by grizzly peak which is a few miles away in a park I e never been too.  I had no shoes or socks on my feet.  I woke up laying on my back with my arms spred  out to my sides .  I was in a huge field full of tall weeds . There was no trail to where I was .  My feet were clean along with the rest of me .  Than I started to walk back .  As I got up to the road I looked back to see a definite trail where I had walked only one.  By the time I just got up to the road I was covered in burles and weeds (so I have no idea about how any of it happened but especially how I could have got to the middle of the field and be totally clean) by the time I walked back to my car a few hours later my feet were destroyed.  I have NEVER SLEPT WALKED BEFORE and even if I did for some insane reason there's NO WAY I could have made it there without being cove! red in weeds and had bloody feet .  This has bothered me so much lately I have no memory of anything but when I think about it my heart starts racing like ALOT so I have to sit down and recompose ... This is the strangest thing to ever happen to me.   When I got back to my car all my things were locked inside including my keys my shoes and socks were there as well even tho when I went to sleep they were on my feet ...  If u have any idea what I should do about this PLEASE HELP ME  I have lost a lot of sleep over this I'm scared to fall asleep now and I'm a 29 year old man ..  Have you ever herd of something like this before ??  Also I had strange marks on my hand that r still  visible..  Like a scar ... Sooo strange and very scary I just gotta find out how this happened it's destroying me . ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

Today 1/24/2019, at approximately (18:49) 6:49PM -8 GMT, I was outside observing the night sky as I often do, I noticed two bright objects that were out of place in the constellation Orion.  They shimmered from orange to bright white.  Orion was rising in the south eastern sky and these objects were flying in a wedge formation just below the feet of Orion.  \"There shouldn't be anything that bright there!\"  I thought to myself.  The objects were more luminous then our brightest star Sirius I also thought which drew my attention to them in the first place.  The lead object was even more so then the trailer.  This viewing lasted approximately ten seconds.  The first object slowly dimmed out of sight still high in the sky, I'd say 30 degrees from the horizon. Then the other about one to two seconds later.  The movement seems to give me an indication to altitude in my opinion.  I view the night sky almost on a daily basis and have seen many things such as satellite's, meteors, high flying military and passenger aircraft.  I cannot say what they were or were not. I can only say THESE LIGHTS WERE VERY STRANGE INDEED!  If anyone else in the San Francisco/Oakland California bay area happened be out at (18:49) 6:49PM observing the south eastern sky and saw this event please don't be afraid to speak up.  I almost didn't want to say anything due to the stigma that go's with \"U.F.O.'s however we all do need to know what's flying above our heads.

THOUGHTS: thought it was strange and went quickly went through what it could be but nothing made sense. could not have been a star bc it was not at the right location. could not have been a building bc there was none and it remained at a high altitude and stayed with a plane going at least 300 mph. was not light from the plane because it was white and did not blink.

I was getting ready to go to the store and I was looking at the sky cuz you was very clear that night and I just so happen to see a shooting star and I was wowed I've never seen a shooting star before I think I'm seeing things move but not anything that close-up I actually saw it fits out or whatever that close to me and then shortly after that I'm looking up and I see something that appears to be a star but it's moving across the sky like it was almost like a shooting star happen and then directly from the place where a phased out as I'm looking into something that appears to be like a star and going across the sky in about 2-3 minutes I watched it go all the way towards Emeryville and the sky was it passed under stars and it look just like a star but starts don't move that way so it's been kind of messing with me for a couple of days it's very playing over and over my head so I thought that I was just say something about it",
