      "story": "Unknown light/object moving perpendicular/horizontal in seconds and disappearing then reappearing At about 5PM in June, 1968, I was in the car with my mother driving east on River Knolls Drive.  As we reached the crest of the hill that led down to our home, I noticed a white/silvery light in the distance over the trees as we looked almost due east (or barely southeast). There was nothing else in sky as it was a clear summer day and I called attention to this unknown light to my mother.  She was surprised at the light and pulled the car over to the side of the road and we began watching the light in the distance(it was off in the distance but I can only guess 10-20 miles away.  When I first spotted this light what caught my attention was the fact that it was at times stationary but would then move up in a direct perpendicular line and would then sometomes move sideways in a direct horizontal line. These movements were in the blink of an eye and guessing at the distance I would say these horizontal and perpendicular movements were many miles in seconds.  We watched this movement for about 15 minutes and the mental image I have is of this unknown light/object making a cross or plus sign in the sky.  As we watched this movement we both commented and agreed that there was nothing we knew of on this earth that could move and change directions so quickly and stop in an an instant.  As we were watching this movement for about 15 minutes all of a sudden the light blinked out. This surprised us and we were going to proceed on home when the light blinked back on and reappeared in about the same spot as we originally saw it.  It made a few more horizontal/perpendicular movements and blinked out again and did not reappear. The total duration of this event was about 20 minutes.  My mother and I were perplexed at this event because we had no explanation for what we had seen.   I was 16 years old at the time and never forgot those amazing 20 minutes. I do know that reporting this 38 years later I can recall the incident as if it had happened 5 minutes ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1968 is approximate.  PD))",

Me and two of my friends were walking down Columbia AVE. to go to an overpass around 10:30 PM to 11:00 PM and while looking at the dark pavement as we walked we noticed what we thought was a spot light coming from a police helicopter behind us. I knew from the color of the light that this was no ordinary spotlight, it was a blueish color that reminded me of the new headlights on some cars but casted no shadow. Curious as to what it was coming from we all looked back at the same time and seen a bright bluish white light hovering (no sound) above the last house on Virginia AVE. which was less than 75 yards away. Before anyone could even think of something to say the spotlight flashed toward the sky and faded out as if it knew we had spotted it but the craft remained glowing. About 2 seconds later still baffled we watched the craft dart off to the north with unbelievable speed (literally the blink of an eye) and was gone. about 2 to 3 seconds later we heard a very loud boom like thunder although there wasn't a cloud in the sky. Now I've never heard a sonic boom before but im willing to bet that is what it sounds like.  To this day my friends are reluctant to talk about this with other people for fear of ridicule, and we have no explaination as to what it was we saw that night. All I can say is there is no man made vehicle that can move like this that I know of, I have never seen anything like it before in my life and I doubt I ever will agian. I remember this like it was yesterday and it will always stay fresh in my mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

This was no more than 20-30 min after I laid down. A bright blue-white light came bursting through my window. I jumped to the end of my bed and opened my blinds expecting to see a helicopter. To my surprise there were 3 orbs out my window. They were all a red purple color, about 2 ft wide, yet they didn\u2019t seem to illuminate any light. The light seemed to be almost internal rather than radiating. The objects were stationary for probably about 10 seconds when they all moved together in line. They seemed to now form one object with the center orb now becoming a blue oval. As soon as the objects merged together the one object moved slowly away and seemed to just \"blink\" away. The power only went off in my room of the house. No other room was effected. Only the clocks and other electronics in my room were effected. This experience completely baffled me. I researched everything I could find. My family thought it was a dream until the next day there were, and still are, circular areas of dead vegetation about 2.5\u2019 wide. I cant explain what happened but whatever it was, it was real I have dead spots surrounded by healthy green plants. I want to know if anyone else out there has had a similar experience.",

      "story": "UFO Sighted Thursday June 30, 1988 at about 23:15 N of Elizabethtown and S of Louiseville on I-65 close to State Park The date was Thursday June 30th, 1988 shortly after 11 PM. I was moving from Houston TX to Metro Detroit MI. I was traveling alone in a huge 26' Ryder Rental Truck while towing my 1985 Cavelier on a tow dolly behind.  I was heading North out of Elizabethtown, KY but was still well South of Lousville, KY on I-65. I saw a State Park sign coming up so I decided to pull over at that exit and just sleep on the shoulder on the side of the road near the highway so I could get an early start with out getting lost in the morning, plus I was not very acclimated with the procedures needed to back this monster mobile up.  Anyway I merged into the exit lane and turned right onto this road (name forgotten).  I proceeded probably a mile or more down this road so I was far enough away to not hear the noise of the occaisonal semi going up the hills on the Interstate.  I pulled off on the right shoulder, went over a hill and stopped near the bottom of the grade.  I engaged the emergency brake and cut the truck motor.  I was smoking a cig and just getting ready lay down on the bench seat and try to get a couple hours sleep before continuing.  Suddenly, I noticed that the interior of the cab was gradually getting lighter.  Mind you, I am out in the middle of nowhere parked by the exterior boundaries of a state park.  Of course I figured it was a car or vehicle of some kind.  Damn if wasn't a vehicle of some kind!  The interior of the truck cab continued to get brighter seeming from behind, but I could not see a vehicle on the road behind me.  The lights go so bright it was kind of freaking me out a little.  I looked out the passenger window and could see some kind of multi-colored lights on what appeared to be some type of flying saucer. I could not see the whole thing, but it was slowing moving over a hill south of me with an approach that seemed to be coming towards me.  I could not take this suspense.  This was a moment when I realized that whatever this was, it was a lot more powerful than I was.  I got out of the truck and stood between the truck and trailer watching this thing approach me.  I made such an effort to hear something as it came closer but I heard not a sound.  Not a single sound.  No wildlife, no bugs, no flying saucer.  But I could see it!  It was not shing a light on me as it was just illuminating the darkness.  It continued to move slowly never varying its speed.  The object appeared to be huge.  My perception was that it was roughly 200 feet across.  I walked to the back of the trailer giving up my false refuge because I really couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The object continued north and went over the next hill seemingly to flew just over the tree tops.  When the lights faded I got back in the truck ane locked the doors. I played the radio for about 5 minutes to help myself calm down.  I decided I really was exhausted even though I had just witnessed an amazing thing.  I turned off the radio, double checked the door locks, and fell asleep.  The next morning about 4:30 I woke up and thought about what I saw.  I actually tried to rationalize that I did not see what I thought I did. I went to start the truck, and the battery was dead.  Last night I only ran the radio for about 5 minutes before I turned it off.  As luck would have it.  I had parked on a slight incline so I release the emergecy brake, put it in neutral and we started rolling downhill.  I pushed in the clutch, put it in 1st and popped the Clutch.  She started right up.  Just coincidence I thought.  I found the entrance to the park further down the road on the right and made a wide U-turn to go back towards I-65 North.  Hours Later I picked up a station from LIMA Ohio that said there had been multiple UFO sightings the night before.  They even gave out a phone number to call if you had seen it. It was probably just their number they were giving out and not an official number, but I was just excited that somebody had seen something last evening and they were describing similar sightings.  I know these areas are 250 miles apart, but it seemed to give my version credability again.  I know it was a UFO because I could not IDENTIFY if. Nor have I seen anything like it since.  I told this story a lot at first, but based on the looks people give you, I very rarely tell it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD))",

It was something I have never seen before or since with my own eyes. I mentioned to my friend the object and he saw it and then noticed a second similar object almost directly above us. The one above us appeared to be closer so we focused on that. I immediately got my binoculars out to have a closer look. The object was metallic and appeared to be circular, or an orb. I would have to say the object was a bit larger than a BB if you held one an arms length away. The objects did not drift or move.

      "story": "Flame looking object south of Louisville, KY airport in 2000 On a very clear morning. I was coming back from the second shop to get a part.  I glanced up to see something I have never seen in my life that stopped me in my tracks and totally speechless.  It was tear drop shaped but the sides were straight not concave and rounded at the front.  It was an orange, red and yellow distinctive but blend of these colors.  Kind of looked like it was on fire or flaming but was not pulsing or flickering.  It seemed like a cut out picture that was suspended in the sky but I knew this was NOT the case. I stood and watched it for a few minutes as it seemed to be heading straight for the ground maybe 1,000 feet or so up.  I caught myself watching in an almost trance-like state I kind of snapped myself out of and thought, \"I HAVE to get someone else to confirm what I am seeing is just that!\".  I knew I wasn't having dillusions, was well rested, not hung over OR on ANY medication. (legal or otherwise)  I briskly headed for the main shop to get the shop foreman because we were the only ones there at the moment.  I went into the office and asked him with much firmness in my voice he needs to come here to see this.  He asked what it was but I just blurted out, \"Just come here. You have to see this!\".   He followed me with out question as I quick stepped it the spot I was standing earlier.  I stopped at the same spot and pointed backwards to the object and replied, \"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!\".  He turned in the southern direction I pointed and froze solid...speechless as well.  Blank stare on his face. After a couple minutes I asked him again. \"What the hell is that?\" He said,  \"Charlie, I really don't know\" in an awe stricken fashion. So, we just stood there for a few minutes more then the object seemed to turn due south very gradually but it didn't bend, flex or change its looks when it did.  It was smaller looking after the turn south and seemed to slowly continue until it got too small to see any more.  It left no trail, residue and had no evidence of being a \"made\" or \"built\" thing.  No lights or anything that people typically report with ufos. This all took place maybe 1 mile south of the Louisville, KY, international airport.  About 1/2 mile west of I-65 and about 1/2 mile south of I-265.  So close to the air port and never heard anything about it on the news or from others.  It seemed to be bigger than the good year blimp.  I can't even be sure it was a craft but it seemed to move with a definite purpose. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

It also was more akin to a boomerang and more rounded than traditional stealth aircraft.  Initially I thought it was a helicopter, as it came and passed it\u2019s appearance was clearer.

At the Starbucks Coffee, 4200 Shelbyville Road, Louisville, KY, I looked up in the clear night sky and happened to see two lighted objects, each about the size of a star or planet, and one trailing the other and seperated by some distance. They were both moving in the same direction, approximately southeast. There was no sound associated with the objects. I looked closely and saw no other colored lights, such as red or green that I have seen with high flying aircraft, with the two lighted objects. The visibility of the two lighted objects faded and was lost while the objects were still high in the sky. I of course am very curious concerning what I was looking at. I am no nonsense person. I only report the facts. I am a 17 year employee of the federal government. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD))",

      "story": "Daylight Cigar shaped UFO sighting, with Witness! What you are about to read is quite unbelieveable. But I swear on my familys life that what I say is true and even have a witness whom saw exactly what I did.. And it changed my life forevermore...  The year was 86.  I was 17. My friend and I were driving on a rural country road/hwy, just outside the town of Louisville KY on a fine clear summer day. The time was about 4:30pm. I was riding shotgun and enjoying the nice country drive when something caught my attention through the corner of my eye off to the left of the highway.  I noticed something large hovering over a wooded area about a quarter mile away.  At first I thought \"what in the world is that?\"  It was a silvery metallic cigar shaped craft that was probably at least a hundred feet long.  It was in a vertical position, just hanging there motionless maybe a hundred feet above the treetops. I pointed this curiosity out to my friend who was just as puzzeled as I. I figured it must be a weather ballon or something like that. But...I have never seen anything even re similar in appearance in my 17 years of life. There were no appendages, wings, motors, rotors, windows, Nothing! It was a solid metallic shape that reflected the suns rays brilliantly. My friend and I were looking at the object trying to figure out what it was, when, in the blink of an eye it was gone!  I was quite excited and scared. Eagerly we scanned the skies around where it had been, looking for it, but it was nowhere to be found.  Maybe 30 seconds later, while looking on the OTHER side of the expressway from where it had been, I saw it hanging there motionless again. Yelling \"there it is!\"  I pointed to my friend where it was, and we both watched it for several seconds.  Then, right before our very eyes, it disappeared slowly, as if it was cloaking, or dematerializing. It just faded out to nothing.  It did not move away.  It just disappeared. We were speechless.  I told family and friends but no one believed me, even with my friend as witness. I cannot describe how I felt, but know that this event convinced me to research what I saw, and over the years I have found much. Having seen this firsthand, I have opened my eyes to accept what others cannot. Many people have seen exactly what I have, all over the world. I don't know what it was that I saw, but it was broad daylight when we saw it, so there is no questionable night time issues here. In my opinion this was no government secret project/craft. 1. The technology was far too advanced. 2.  The speed used would have broken a humans neck, or the G forces involved would have been impossible for a human to withstand. 3.  As far as I know , no government on earth has craft cloaking/dematerializing abilities.  This has bothered the hell out of me for 20 years. It could be a government project, but I seriously doubt it. Having seen what I have, I honestly believe we are being visted by beings from another world.  Before I die, my one wish in this world is to truly know what I saw.

My daughter was driving us to a drive-in fast food chain for dinner after we were moving her into an apartment on the east / northeast side of Louisville, Kentucky. I looked to my right from the passenger seat and viewed what i thought a balloon someone had just let loose. The sun had set and the sky was almost dark but still had a slight glow to the sky. The balloon object; no lights,  was flying away from my position like a knuckle ball at about the 2:00 o'clock position, but the wind was blowing into my face from the north. Than without a noise, the balloon object went straight up about 12:00 o'clock position, dove straight down to the left, came right at us over another fast food place and grew to about 10'-14' in diameter. I told my daughter to look at the object when i pointed over the buildings horizon. She saw the tear dropped balloon looking object and within a second it darted up and out to the left and was gone in 1 sec. It shrank in size as if traveling at a very very high rate of speed. Again no noise. If it were a balloon, how could the balloon travel seem to go against the wind about 1/4 mile and hover perfectly still, move again very quickly, hover, and take off like it was shot out of cannon?

At first we thought it might be a bright star, but the object appeared to pulse, which was quite abnormal. Continuing to examine the object I noticed that it appeared to pulse slightly into a haze, as if the object were having some sort of lensing effect applied to it, so I rolled down the vehicle window and looked at the object in the clear, and sure enough the hazing was not an effect of the windshield or any other glass or reflection. While I was observing the object it pulsed and winked out.  I would have thought nothing more of it except that it returned about 4-seconds later.  Upon further observance as we approached berry blvd, the object again pulsed but the effect seemed longer and brighter with angular stabbing lights extending from it briefly.  I looked and noted it was not a plane, had no running lights of any kind and as I was checking to see if it was mounted on a tower, the object disappeared again.  4 seconds or thereabouts later, it re-appeared. It was certainly not the moon, it wasn\u2019t a plane and the object didn\u2019t move, nor was it mounted on a tower.

I watched it as I drove and then pulled off the road to get a better view and determine its speed, size, etc.  It was cone-shaped, with the open part up, but very nearly an isosceles triangle from my vantage point. It had what appeared to be a thin rod projecting from the bottom point of the cone.  At the end of the rod there appeared to be a shiny sphere. I watched it as it floated in a stationary position.  After about 3 minutes, a C130 took off from SDF, flew by the UFO, and then headed west.  The UFO then almost immediatly headed east and increased its altitude.  The craft appeared to move at about the speed of a helicopter, but remained perfectly vertical from what I could tell. This craft was completely black except for the shiny sphere at the end of the rod.  My theory is that its visual stealthing wasn't working properly.  I did not take a photo because I was concerned about getting in trouble.  My assumption at that point was that it was a US military stealth drone of some sort.

As the sun rose above the horizon, it quickly ascended into the blanket of clouds reaching beyond me. I proceeded to drive away, then I remembered I needed to go pick up some paperwork. I immediately turned back around and drove past where I was parked. After I drove for quarter of mile I was facing the security entrance which faces the southeast. As I was driving, I something caught my eye just above the security entrance below the blanket of clouds. I said to myself \"I have never seen a cloud that round before\". The round object stayed there for five to ten seconds and then it went up into the blanket of clouds. I saw a shadow of the object moving erratically lasting for approximately 10 seconds. The shadow then disappeared.  The conditions of the day were mostly cloudy. The ceiling was 3100 feet, winds were 18 mph from the Southwest and wind gust 26 mph.

I was observing it from LaGrange Road, in front of the Kroger, while stopped at a light.  It was again, an equilateral triangle of white lights, surrounding a red flashing light.  There were no other visible lights. This craft was heading right to left from my perspective. It appeared to be flying higher, or farther away, probably 500-750 feet. It was hard to judge because it was night. But this time, there was another craft following it, by my estimates, way to close to be 2 planes. It was closing the entire time until the disappeared behind some trees. The following craft could easily have been a small terrestrial aircraft. There appeared to be 2 other aircraft in the sky, but at a glace, they appeared terrestrial, and my attention was on the seemingly extra-terrestrial aircraft.

The light was very very bright and seemed to be unstable as if beams were shooting out from all over it. A I watched this object, just to the left of it what at first I thought was a plane flew right into it.  I looked to the right thinking it was going fly past it and it did not. That is when I jumped up and told my son something is not right with that object I think it is a UFO. As we watched it within 3-4 minutes two white bullet  shapes objects came out of it,one on the left and one on the right. I ran in and grabbed my video camera and started filming it. We watched as its movements were irratic at times and at one time before it completely disappeared it came closer and then backed away and then disappeared. Within about 5 minutes it reappeared in the same area and to the right of it a red object appeared in the sky. The red object moved faster than any jet we had ever seen. It was if it was encircling the the white object. Then all of a sudden they disappear and we see flashes of white light as if someone was taking a picture and the flash was so bright. By now our neighbors were outside watching the activity and we noticed all the planes coming into our airport were circling away and we noticed jets taking off in the direction of the ufos. All of a sudden we hear a sonic boom and we look at the traces in the sky from the jets heading in that direction. I tried to video tape the red object and the happenings afterwards but for some odd reason I could not get it to film, all I got was static across my screen as I tried to film it. Witnesses: 1.

      "story": "Fast moving object with flashing red light near Louisville, Kentucky. A few minutes after 10 p.m. on Tuesday, October 14, 2008, I was sitting on the deck in my backyard in Louisville, Kentucky when I observed a small round object with a red flashing light and a white light which was not flashing moving from north to south across a clear sky.    The object appeared to be spinning.   I was lying on a lounge chair facing west and looking toward the sky when I first observed the object coming from the north.   The northern horizon is not visible from our house due to large trees in the neighborhood.   I observed the object first as it came into view in the sky above the trees obstructing my view of the northern horizon. I am not good at judging altitude, but I would guess that the object was at least a couple thousand feet in the air.  We live eight miles southeast of the Louisville International Airport.   The object did not come from the airport and was not going there-it was not in any kind of a holding pattern, and it was moving too fast to be a plane.   It was too high to have taken off from or to be landing at the Louisville International Airport.    I could not hear any noise from the object, but due to the constant drone of the traffic on my street and on nearby Bardstown Road, it is likely that any noise the object was making was drowned out. The sky was completely clear, and the moon was full.  Visibility of the nighttime sky is never good in my neighborhood.  We live two blocks from a major Louisville thoroughfare, Bardstown Road, and the city lights make spotting even any of the constellations difficult.  Despite the completely clear sky, few stars were visible. As I was watching the object move across the sky, my wife opened the kitchen window and asked me what I was doing.  I asked her to come outside.  She and my 15 year old daughter came out on the deck as the object was nearing the southern horizon.  They also observed the object and were unable to identify what it was. I would be interested to learn if anyone else in the Louisville area observed this object.",

I slowed down as I got closer and happened to look to the left and I saw another object not more than 40 feet from me. I could almost clearly see this object. It was shaped like a triangle with a dent in the middle, like a mouse pointer. There were a row of white lights from the tip to the end and a red light at the very end. I could tell that it was dark grey at the top and light grey on the underneath. As I slowed down to watch and to try to get a picture, the object moved behind a row of houses and some trees then it hovered over one houses roof about a foot from it. None of the houses had lights on. I turned down a side street to try to get closer and watched another object with similar bright lights fly very quickly across the sky far in the distance for about 50 seconds. I turned back down the main road from before and onto the same side street and another object was flying directly above my car. It was shaped exactly like the object from before, triangular and with a row of white lights with one red light at the end. There was no noise, as with an airplane and the object flew very quickly as I guess it realized I was there and took off to quickly for me to see or follow.

At first I believed someone had set off a firework display, but immediately realized something was odd about it.  For one, there was no sound at all, no pop or boom that would accompany a firework going off.  Also it lasted only a split second and it was very condensed. It did not expand and then slowly fade out as a firework would.  This was simply there and then it was gone as if it winked out or it was moving very fast.  I only saw it for literally a second, but i remember there were multiple bright colors of lights. I would describe it as a smear in the sky of bright pink, green, blue, maybe others.  Individual points of colored lights of various brightness. I just kind of stood there a few moments waiting to see if i could see it again.  I got in and out of the car a couple times to make sure i wasn't just seeing a reflection or something.  The sky was clear and there w! as no lightning or any weather effect that I could determine.  I realize a split second sighting is essentially useless, unless somebody else happened to see something odd last night, but whatever it was, it struck me as odd.",

      "story": "Blk Triangle craft mimics aircraft in Metro louisville. This is no hoax. I swear to you. For the past year I've seen odd things in a certain area in Louisville. It is craft that are mimicing normal aircraft, kinda.  It sort of looks like an airplane, but it's not.  I have lived near an airport for 16 years so I know aircraft! The lights are weird, and it makes no sound, and hovers, and goes fast real quick. I have saw it 4 times in a year. I'm going to tell you about the most important sighting. In July of 2010 at 11pm a friend and myself was driving on I-64 heading one into Louisville. Up on my left I noticed some bright lights, three or four whites & one larger red at an unusually low altitude. At first, I thought maybe it was from a tower of some kind, but it was too big and was definitely some sort of craft. It looked like plane lights kinda, but it wasn't moving at all.  It hovered at about 700 to 1100 feet. I could not see the shape because of the brightness of the object.  Then it started moving and turning/rotating, and for a moment I saw it outlined against the sky. It was a black triangle probably about 30 to 40 feet long. It hovered/turned to where the wings were facing the ground as if turning a tight turn. Then it moved out of sight VERY quickly. Probably a mile in 15 to 30 seconds!   Then it came back just as fast!  Needless to say, we were shaken as we drove out of ! view. This was right off the freeway. I have seen these lights other times as well. Something is up with this certain location. Want to see what it looks like? Look up Oxicarian Ufo on youtube.com and you will see what I saw. To the Tee!!! I researched what we saw and me & the other witness agree that that was it. And yes, this is 100% the truth!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

A concert was going on and fireworks were to be expected later.   I happened to look up and noticed a craft that was unexplainable.  I studied harder and harder, as did my boyfriend and human aircraft was not coming up as a logical option.  It was traveling very fast but you could tell it was so high that it wasn't going from point A to B in a snap, as others describe sightings often.  It was the type of thing that when you looked away for a few seconds, and tried again to sight it, it would be much further east.  (Kentucky facing Indiana).   Eventually it got to be at such an elevation, it was hard to keep up with and make out anymore.  Moments later, I noticed even further southeast, it seemed to have two other identical objects waiting for it.  As my boyfriend and I were making our way to the port-o-john's, also in their direction, we looked up and all three were gone.  He said others around us were pointing and had also noticed.  This would have been a great time to discuss it with others had it not been for the loud music.   I was so perturbed, I came home and \"googled\" it instantly and found that someone else on www.godlikeproductions.com had witnessed the same thing as well as his wife.  He remains anonymous, but I suggested that it is okay, I saw the exact same thing, and he and I both captured it with camera.  I had seven still photos, and am regretting not video taping it.   I have always been intrigued by extra-terrestrials as well as government cover up and am excited and feel betrayed at the same time.  I am so desperate to know more.   Please contact me back.",

      "story": "In 1953, at the age of 3 years old  I was Contacted by what is described as a \"GREY\".  This happened in Ky in 1953.  Now, as to why I was there since I am from Indiana,  My mother and Father and I was living out of a car since my dad did not have a job and we lived basically out of a car.  We were somewhat like gypsy's and mom and dad would get work with Carnivals.  Tv was almost NONE EXISTENT since we had no home most of the time.  Now, I mentioned this because I was NOT influenced by any tv program that might have made me \"DREAM\" what happened to me.  I am entirely SERIOUS about what happened to me!!!  Make no mistake about it.It has perplexed me for years, and only recently I found out that there are places like this to report things of this nature.  I think this might intriuge you as what was said to me by my Mother only about three years ago, SHE TOLD ME that at the age of nine or ten she was ABDUCTED and taken up into a ship that had NO CORNER'S in it!  This is important since mom had NO WAY of knowing that reports given by OTHER abductee's reported the SAME THING! I almost fell out of my chair when she related her experience to me. I NEVER knew about it till three years ago!!!!!  I was telling her of my experience, and that is when it came into the conversation about mom.  Now, my EXPERIENCE as I call it. My Grandmother and Grandfather had to come to Ky to retreive me since my mom anmd dad were about to go away to prison for an extended period of time.  They brought a travel trailer with them for us to stay in till the end of mom and dad's trial.  This, is where the CONTACT came to me. Grandma had made a palete on the floor beside there bed in the back of the trailer.  I was sleeping and awoke abruptly and had the distinct feeling before opening my eyes something was LOOKING at me, and, IT WAS! Standing over me was an odd looking creature THIN in nature with an oval looking head with large dark eyes.When it saw that I was aware of it b! eing there, it raised up straight, turned to the right and in ! a Jerky strobe light looking way, turned to the hallway, and about half the way down the hall simply VANISHED into what I call \"THIN AIR\", or disapeared or whatever you want to call it. I remember this event as if it was yesterday, and can remember every aspect of it. I have had other instances in my life and in one instanse even had a wittness to it that scared the crap out of him so much so he ran into the house because tyhings outside during this event was \"NOT RIGHT\". That would be another story another time. I am a Nam Vet and also had experiences with that too. As if I was being informed of danger ahead of time. I was a Pointman with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. This is important to me to know there are other's out here that KNOW of there existence, and KNOW what I have gone through all these years. This is NO JOKE! And, I do not take lightly, ANYONE taking what I relate to them LIGHTLY either! I want answers and I will do whatever it take s to find out the \"WHY\".   I thank you for your time.

      "story": "Red/Orange fireballs over Louisville, KY, USA on New Year's 2012 Right after midnight on New Years Eve, I witnessed strange lights in the sky near Shenanigans Pub (Corner of Norris and Deerwood) in Louisville. Several other patrons saw the lights and I was able to snap a few photos (attached) and my friend was able to record some video. The lights were orange glowing balls and travelled generally south to north and appeared to be powered. Ambient noise from the bar was loud so I couldn't hear if the lights made any noise. They travelled one after another along the same path at erratic intervals, although usually around twenty or thirty seconds apart. They travelled in a straight flight path and that path generally drifted and changed to the northwest as the event took place. They were below the cloud cover, but one did go through the lowest clouds. I estimate I saw around twenty and that the whole event lasted 10 or 20 minutes. To recap, they travelled at approximately the same altitude and along the same path. They glowed a dark orange and didn\u2019t seem to flash. When viewing them through my camera phone they seemed to flash at a constant rate. My friend who also witnessed the event is a pilot and called Standiford Field air traffic control (Louisville International Airport) and they said they had nothing flying in the area. Both of us called the police and the dispatcher said we were the only people to call it in. And we called a local news station tip line who told us we were the only callers to report the event. I also emailed all four local news stations with the facts and photos on January 1st and received no response. Finally, in one of the photos some non-glowing spots are visible. I\u2019m didn\u2019t see those during the event so I\u2019m not sure if they are due to reflections or some other camera error, or if they are related to the event.",

      "story": "Yellow Light with trail of sparks arcing across the sky Me and my friend were driving to my house, and along the road, I had looked up, and i saw what looked like a plane with a trail.  But the trail could have been my bad vision blurring the light into something else.  But then it started shooting a trail of sparks like a firework, and i turned to my friend and I told him to look up and see it too.  and he did and he saw it as well.  It was a more yellow light, rather than a white light.  And we thought it could have just been a firework, but then it started making a perfect arc in one direction, then turned and went upwards making another perfect ark.   We then got out of the house, and the sky sounded completely silent. At this point we started freaking out and considering our options.  Was it a jet that caught fire and was crashing? A new type of fire work?  But it looked like it was directly above Denver. We drove past a few houses and trees that blocked our sight from it.  And before i knew it it was gone. The trail coming off of the light was maybe seven sparks long at first, but then it grew in length to about possibly twenty sparks.  It almost looked like something was cutting a hole in the sky with an angle grinder.  But obviously it wasn't.  Hope this information is useful.",

      "story": "Glowing orange ball traveled across the sky in Fern Creek area My family and I gathered on the deck behind our house in the Fern Creek area of Louisville, Kentucky around 10 pm eastern time to watch the neighborhood fireworks being lit on 4th of July.  I, my wife, and 2 teen aged daughters were present. At 10:11 pm, a glowing orange object appeared in the northeastern sky.  The object was traveling very quickly in a southeast direction, and it disappeared in the southern sky about 30 seconds later.  The object was flying at an altitude lower than airplanes in the area travel.  The object did not make any sound.  It was evident from both the altitude of the object, the distance it traveled, its size, and the fact that it made no sound that it was not fireworks. The fireworks being lit in the neighborhood were of the consumer variety, not the kind used by professional fireworks show producers. One witness, my 19 year old daughter, described the object at \"a  round orange ball.\"   She also described it as looking like \"a crown.\"   My wife described it as \"glowing,\" and appearing to look like \"a hot air balloon.\" My 14 year old daughter described it as \"red, glowing, pentagon of fire.\" Due to the area\u2019s proximity to the Louisville International Airport approximately 8 miles away and Bowman Field airport about 5 miles away, there is a lot of aircraft in the area at all hours of the day and night.  However, it was evident to all of us this was not a commercial or private aircraft.",

      "story": "Bright orange objects over Louisville, KY I stepped outside with a friend to get some air and noticed a round orange &quot;fireball&quot; object going from the northwest to the southeast approximately 1000 to 1500 feet above the ground.  The light was moving about the same speed as a small plane, and was moving steadily and in a different direction than the wind. At first, we thought it might be some type of Chinese lantern, but the object did not flicker and was moving slightly against the wind.  The object finally drifted into a hazy cloud bank and dissappeared. About 2 minutes later we spotted another object going in the same direction and speed but higher up and a little south of the first object.  We watched this object until it was obscured by some trees. The third onject was about a mile north of the first object and was only in view for a few seconds before being obscured by trees. The fourth object appeared about 3 minutes later, and was almost overhead.  The object was also going in the same general direction, but a little lower.   We watched it cross the sky for almost a minute before it just seemed to fade out. We waited for another 20 minutes but saw nothing further. These objects were a bright orange color, solidly lit, and moved in a steady speed and direction.  They did not flicker, and were not affected by the wind. We were both a little freaked out, and tried to rationalize the sightings with prosaic explanations like small planes, Chinese lanterns, balloons etc.  But there was no noise, and if they were balloons or lanterns, they would have to have been released a mile or two from each other, and at different times rather than from the same place and all at once. I sincerely hope someone else in the area noticed these objects too!   Although this was on the fourth of July, it had nothing to do with fireworks",

      "story": "Dimly Traveling home from a family dinner, we were just a few minutes from our house turning into the neighborhood adjacent to our own when a strange light caught my attention in the sky.  The reason it caught my attention was because it wasn't very high in the sky and it was a dim orange color, almost like a dull overhead highway light.  It was pretty still so I had time to notify my family in the car and the odd nature of it's position in the sky.  It wasn't high enough to be a plane (plus it wasn't moving) nor was it low enough to be a street light.  My wife reminded us that when we left there were several hot air balloons in the area, however it was pretty dark and it was unlikely they were still floating around. As we continued to drive we were now moving in a different direction so we were watching from the side window and now the object appeared to be almost like a fireball but we knew it wasn't because if it were an actual fireball it would have been much brighter however we thought it might be possible of it was a leftover hot air balloon in terrible distress.  We took another turn now heading towatds the object and were expecting to get a better view oit the front windshield when the object appeared further away even though we knew we were moving closer to it.  At this point the object gradually moved directly up and out of sight leading all of us to conclude that this was something very different.  We don't normally believe in such happenings but this occurrence doesn't leave a whole lot of other explanations that we are aware of which lead us to the iternet when we got home.  Most surprising from our internet research was reading other descriptions of sightings that included fireball like observations further validating what we know we observed.

Then making no visible turn stopped and began going to the left.  The outer red lights then flickered out one a time and the white light seemed to get brighter.  At this time I could no longer make out the shape of the craft, just see the bright white light.  There was no sound. It looked like a star, very low, directly above the treeline and it moved to my left (West) very slowly across the sky.  Then it faded like it was never there.

This happened at 11 p.m.  The lights traveled east to west and were gone in a matter of 2 to 3 minutes. They may have been traveling along the Ohio River. These lights were fairly high in the sky, upper cloud level, and moved at a fast past. The group seemed to swarm across the sky.  There were some near the edges of the group, the group was traveling in a rather loose round or ball shape.  Near the edges of the circle there were lights that were moving in and out of the group. There were also stragglers that quickly caught up with the group as they moved across the sky.  These lights appeared smallish and they had blinking red, blue, green, yellow lights.  These color-changing lights appeared to be like an LED light. I have lived near the airport almost all my life and have never seen or experience anything like I saw that night.  There was no nose.  There was no wind, at least at the ground level on that evening. I was so shaken; I placed a call to 911 and sent an email to the local television station.  I thought for sure someone else would have seen the phenomenon but I cannot find any other report online.",

I opened the kitchen door to the garage and could see flashes of white light in the alley coming through spaces on the overhead door.  I assumed it was our local police helicopter circling in search of a suspect.  This is not unusual.  This is a ranch style house and the path the craft was flying meant it flew slowly over the length of the house.  The rumbling lasted so long that I went to the deck in the backyard and noticed a large object which was apparently triangular in shape because there were pulsing red lights at each of its 3 corners.  I didn't have my glasses on and am near sighted, but I could determine that the object was slowly moving northward and was crossing a busy east/west street heading towards Portland. I had time to run and get my glasses.  Then I observed a car, headed eastward had pulled over and was watching this thing cross over the street.  The craft was likely following the path of the river which is to our west.

I had my cruise control set at 60m.ph, radio turned off, and windows partially down.   Around the zorn avenue exit, right outside of downtown Louisville.  I noticed about a half a mile ahead of me and on the other side of the highway, a object above the tree line. (TREE LINE RUNS DOWN BOTH SIDES OF ENTIRE HIGHWAY)   My first thought was wow that helicopter, plane is flying low.  Thats when the cruise control came off and i slowed to around 45m.p.h.  The object started moving across the highway, at a northwestern fashion.  This object was about 200 feet above the ground, about the size of a mini van or large car, and made no noise.  What made me notice this object was the lights, it had a series of bright green and extremely vivid colored lights on the bottom or belly in a V shape or triangl! e.  With the green lights at the corners.  There was also one red light in the middle that pulsed slowly, almost like a heartbeat.    I watched this thing fly directly over top of my car.  Looking through my windshield and up over my steering wheel, i noticed the silouette only because of the close by downtown city lights.  The object had round edges   almost like a football but wider, that made up the entire craft.  It was really strange,  the whole time i couldn't see the object only the lights, but they were so bright i dont understand how they didnt light up any part of this object, they should have, but this was black or cloaked is best described.  I continued to watch as it flew over and past me above the tree line on my side of highway.  I was able to see this object from the front, from its side, and from its rear.  No other lights were on this object at all, and living by Louisville you know what planes, helicopters, commercial and even some military aircraft look an! d sound like.  F.A.A requires all aircraft to use a red light ! on one s ide or wing, a green on the other and a white flashing light at the rear.  This object had only  lights on the bottom, nowhere else.   This is by far probably the strangest thing ive ever seen, and would really love to know what it was.   It wasnt a helicopter, it wasnt a plane, it wasnt a toy or R.c because it was too big, and think to myself would military be flying some drone or black ops over a highway with bright green lights, it doesnt make sense to me.  I hope someone else saw this thing because for right now im sleepin with my pistol close by.",

I immediately spotted a single light-orange orb in the southwest part of the sky moving northeast at a moderate rate of speed.  It didn\u2019t appear to be at a high altitude \u2013maybe a couple of hundred feet above the ground (although I\u2019m certainly not the best judge of distances).  If I were to have held up my thumb, it would have been just a bit smaller than the size of my thumbnail.  It passed to the west of me and I followed its path as it headed northeast until it disappeared. It was extremely bright.  I saw no blinking lights around it, as you see on planes. It had no form, like a plane, simply a brilliant ball of light.  And, what struck me as the strangest thing of all, was that it was completely silent. My husband and I spend many nights outside on the patio star-gazing.  Since we are very close to the flight path of Louisville International Airport, Bowman Field, and a TV station that has a helicopter landing pad, my husband and I are very familiar with all types of aircraft at all levels of altitude.  Even though we live relatively close to the city and the light pollution can sometimes be a problem, we can also spot satellites as they pass overhead. Despite our familiarity with the aircraft/spacecraft that fly over our home (we\u2019ve lived here for 8 years), I couldn\u2019t identify this as anything I\u2019d ever seen in the past.  I remember asking myself, \u201cWhat IS that?\u201d  When it had disappeared (after being visible to me for about 45 seconds), I walked back inside and mentioned to my husband that I\u2019d just seen something that I\u2019d never seen before in my life.  I wondered silently to myself if I\u2019d seen a UFO. A few days later, while checking the Internet, I found reports of people in California on New Year\u2019s Eve spotting light orange orbs of light that were completely silent.  I was stunned.  I believe I saw exactly the same thing in Louisville, KY. (END)",

      "story": "Several Unexplained Objects Flying Low in the Night Sky My wife and I were driving home from celebrating Valentines Day dinner in Downtown Louisville, KY on 02/16/2013.  At approximately 10:20pm while driving northeast on Hurstbourne Lane towards I-64, we witnessed at least 20 glowing red orbs in the eastern sky towards the town of Shelbyville, KY.  The sky was overcast, with high winds, low cloud cover, and probably less than ten miles visibility. I hold a private pilot certificate and have worked several years in the aviation industry.  I know these were not manned aircraft for several reasons:   1.  \tThe bad weather/visibility would have prevented a large group of aircraft from flying in close formation at such low altitude. 2.\t  There were no position lights.  U.S. powered aircraft always have a red light on the left wing, a green light on the right wing, and a white light on the tail.  Prudent pilots will always fly with a flashing omnidirectional beacon. 3.\t  The orbs of light mostly stayed stationary in the sky and did not seem affected by the high winds. Occasionally the orbs would move vertically (both up and down) at high rates of speed. The sky was overcast, these were not stars. 4.\t  They were bright red orbs. The intensity was strong and the light didn\u2019t waver. 5.\t  They were in a strange formation, some were higher/lower than others. They didn\u2019t seem to be organized in any sensible pattern either horizontally or vertically. 6.\t  They suddenly disappeared.  This video is very similar to what we saw, though there were many of them all at the same time:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi-6DFe2fEg&list=PL4D428923123EF286   Possible explanations/problems with our sighting:   1.  \tI thought they could have been sky lanterns (like those used in eastern cultures).  They seemed to be flying over part of the U of L extension campus. It\u2019s possible that a group of students launched a bunch of them to celebrate Valentines Day weekend.  However, as stated before, there were really high winds that night and the orbs appeared to be relatively stationary in the sky.  The orbs also moved vertically at high rates of speed.  I have also scoured the internet to find news of celebrations involving sky lanterns.  I haven\u2019t found anything.  We do not live in Louisville so we do not have ready access to their news outlets. 2.  \tThey could be helicopters flying in a rough formation.  The problem is: no position lights, it was overcast, very dark, with high winds, and really what would be the point?  I don\u2019t see a bunch of pilots participating in a potentially dangerous flight at night with low visibility. 3.  \tThey could have been stars.  It was overcast, the orbs moved, and stars don\u2019t shine red. 4.\t  The only exasperating part of our experience is that I can find no evidence on the internet that anyone else witnessed what we saw!!  These were high enough in the sky that thousands of people could have potentially seen them.  It was a Saturday night on a holiday weekend. I would love to have an explanation for what we saw, or at least hear that someone else also witnessed this! If you have any information I would definitely be interested in hearing it. This was not my first experience with a UFO sighting in Louisville, KY. In 2000 I was working at Standiford Field (the Louisville Airport SDF) for the summer.  It was a warm night and the skies were crystal clear.  Several airline agents and I witnessed a large white lens shaped object seemingly floating in the night sky to the northwest.   We thought it might have been an advertising dirigible flying over Papa John\u2019s Stadium.  However, it seemed to just suddenly appear.  We could not hear any engines (to indicate that it was powered). It was not present the night before, or the night after our sighting.  It did not move at all.   We contacted the control tower to ask what it was and they had no explanation.  There was nothing on their radar.  We had to work an inbound flight, but when we were done, the object in the sky was gone.  A possible explanation is that it might have been a large balloon tethered to the nearby stadium.  However I have several problems with this:   (1)  It was huge; it appeared to be the size of the good year blimp. (2)  It had no top: there were clear skies and its top seemed to just fade into nothing. (3)  It did not move. (4)  There was no visible advertising on the side.  It seemed to be illuminated by the city lights below. (5)  It disappeared   (6) ATC (air traffic control) did not know what it was  (7) Standiford is a busy airport, and is a major hub for UPS. Huge cargo aircraft are constantly flying in and out of SDF all of the time (especially at night).  I do not see the FAA allowing such a huge balloon (if it was a ballon) to be tethered so close to the airport, especially at night. I would love to hear more information on this one as well.  We do not live in Louisville, but we do live in another major city nearby.  I find it ironic that both of my sightings have been in Louisville.  I\u2019m still very skeptical, but just a little excited too.  I hope this information helps in some way.",

They were travelling in the same direction and one was in front of the other.  I can\u2019t say how large they were or how far apart they were due to the distance.  However, they appeared to be travelling over the Indian Hills area in North Eastern Jefferson County. At first I thought they were floating Chinese lanterns, but I determined that they could not be lanterns due to the speed at which they were travelling.  They seemed to glow orange/gold and flicker sporadically.  I immediately took out my iPhone camera and videotaped the lights, but they were so small in the video.  I then noticed that there was another light in front of the other two, also travelling the same direction.  As I ran up to the house, the first light faded into the cloud cover. When I reached the house, my daughter joined me outside and she also captured video of the two remaining objects.  As the 2 closest ones were starting to fade into the clouds, one final light appeared through the trees, following the previous three.  We both agreed that these were not a normal aircraft that we are familiar with;  UFOs by definition.  The area where the objects appeared is close to the flight path that passenger jets use as they round into their landing pattern at the Louisville airport.  However, these lights appeared much lower than any jet would travel, and there was no sound.  There were no blinking lights on the objects, just the occasional flickering.  The objects appeared as if they were completely illuminated; glowing.  They were close enough to see that they had some mass, not just a light in the sky.  But I couldn\u2019t determine how large they were.  And they all had the same steady pace and straight flight.  I wouldn\u2019t say they were speeding across the sky, but they were travelling faster than wind would carry the objects.  Also, the wind was travelling ESE (1 mph) and these objects were travelling NW.  I could submit my video, but you can only see 2 pinpoints of light, not any of the details that I described.  I haven't seen my daughter's video yet.  I\u2019ve seen comets, meteors and satellites and I know these objects were none of those things. I\u2019ve never been a big believer in UFOs but I didn\u2019t disbelieve either.  What we saw tonight isn\u2019t something that would make me say that we definitely saw alien craft, but I can say it was very strange and unlike anything that I've ever seen.",

I noticed no other lights and no noise of any kind beyond normal traffic and ground noises. I checked again to make sure I wasn't mistaking it for a plane, and there it sat, exactly the same way that bricks don't, in place in the air, maybe four to 5 stories off the ground if the surrounding buildings went up that high.  No other lights or markings or sound. It wasn't doing anything, just sitting there and not moving and not making a sound. Swung by about 6 minutes later, and it was gone.  On way home we saw some aircraft seeming to be searching the area and you could hear them miles off.. which helped confirm for me that there was no way that black triangle was a plane or a helicopter..  I would have heard it and it probably would have smacked into the buildings downtown at the height it was at. I can't say how big it was for sure, but it looked to be about 50-75 ft across.. but there was a tip of the triangle over both buildings on either side of the street, so.. it was big enough.",

The light was so bright that it surrounded the entire craft.  I was not able to see any shape of the craft because the light was so bright so I am going to say it was a sphere.  It did not flash, it was a static light.   The craft was relatively high up in the sky, but still below the cloud line.  It flew straight across from the right all the way past our front yard and off to the left.  Because of the height I did not hear any sound, but I still found that a bit odd because other craft around that altitude usually make some sort of noise.   The craft would pivot slightly to the left and right.  Sort of like a boat in rough seas.  Do not mistake this for the normal \"zipping across the sky\"  this looked more like wind was effecting it because it was moving at a relatively slow speed. There were no other lights other than the red.  No white lights, no strobes, etc... Having said that, I have to take an educated approach to this sighting.  Even though I might belive in something like this, there is always a possibility that there is a simple explination to this.   I thought to myself, well the slow speed and subtle pivoting, and bright red light... it could have been a helicopter.  But not a commercial one because of the bright red light, so then maybe a military helicopter.  But the fact that the light was so bright and no other strobing lights were on it, and there was no sound I am having a hard time accepting my own answer to this.  I have seen other military helicopters in the area and they are extremely loud.  And just to rule it out, it was moving way too fast to be a hot air balloon. We live near a small airfield (Bowman Field) and I see aircraft all the time, and am quite familiar with the lights on crafts.  I look in the sky several times a day waiting to find something, and sure enough I did!   This is honestly the first time I have been unable to explain this sighting and it is all I have been able to think about for days now.  I have seen everything from military helicopters, small planes, news helicopters, drones (about once a month) and now this. I have a very short video that I took of it, though my phone was low battery and shut off shortly after i started to record so I was unable to take any still images.  (go figure, just my luck).",

From my vantage point, it looked to be slightly in front of the plane and a short distance away on the left side of the plane (the side I was sitting on).  It was hard to gauge the distance being that it was partly cloudy and flying at night.   I was able to observe the light/orb for about 30-40 minutes.  The object would move farther away and then back, which was observable by seeing it fly through the clouds and then back into the open nearer the plane.  Every so often, it would make quick movements moving up and down, like almost mocking the plane and yet flying with us at the same time.

It was around 5:00pm and I was traveling in a northerly direction. I was just about to take my exit from one expressway to another when I noticed to my left an odd little cloud that was lit up from behind and was displaying rainbow colors.  I kept looking at it trying to figure out what it was. In addition, right in front of me was a huge ball of beautiful pale yellow light, not moving at all, just hanging there in the sky.  At the time I thought was the sun.  It was massive and it didn\u2019t hurt the eyes to look directly at it.  It was like looking at the sun through a gauzy haze. The oddly colorful and brightly lit cloud to my left captured my attention.  As I continued to drive, I was looking from the ball of light in front of me, to the anomaly on my left.  I was observing other drivers to see if anyone else noticed anything out of the ordinary and no one seemed to.  Unfortunately, I was unable to pull over to examine it more closely due to heavy traffic and the lack of a safe place to do so. It was the next day while traveling home at the same time of day and the same route that I realized that the anomaly to my left I had witnessed the day before was actually the sun shining through a cloud; and that the large ball of light was the true anomaly.   I still marvel to this day about what it could have been; and I regret not pulling off the highway to get a better look.",

(1/2 acre) I could see the bottom of the  craft and saw lights at the points of the triangle but there was no sound.  Our pine trees were 29 yrs old at that time and the craft was just above them moving very very slow. I tried to get out into the front yard but my husband was rigid in the doorway and blocked me from leaving the house. We watched it moved east crossing the street over a heavily wooded 4 acres of land until we could not see it any more. My husband tells me that he could see an object moving toward our house from way off and watched it til it moved over our roof and ran for the front door.  We were so stunned by this event that all I remember was that he went back to his tv room and we never discuss this again.  I wanted to but he did not!

      "story": "Bright white orb moving steadily cross the sky slowly until it swelled, retracted, and moved away at a high rate of speed. On 10/4/15, at approximately 20:30 EST, a bright white orb moving to slow to be an aircraft was observed in the area.  At first observation the object looked to be the ISS in orbit but as it moved closer to the area it became very obvious it was too low to be orbiting.  The object was inside the atmosphere and much lower to ground.   The object made no sound.  The object was observed to be twice the size of the ISS at closer range comparatively.  The object was observed to be at a range of approximately 1/2 mile away and an approximate altitude of 3000 feet but no more than 4000 feet.  The object was observe at an angle of approximately +40\u00b0 to +42\u00b0 traveling from the southwest at approximately 230\u00b0 moving north at approximately 21\u00b0.  These numbers are based on a positive upward bubble.  The event could not be triangulated. After 1 minute of straight steady movement in the sky toward the area it came into clear sight.  The object covered the same distance moving away as it did coming toward the area.  After it cleared the area moving away it maintained its steady speed and altitude for approximately 30 seconds.  The event seemed to last less than 2 minutes. As the object was moving away from the area it swelled, retracted, maneuvered and moved away at an extreme high rate of speed.  The object left a short black streak in its wake before leaving the Earth's deep orbit. The object achieved greater than light speed due to an observable black streak or absence of light. The event did not cause silence of animals nor insects.  The event did not cause a feeling of emptiness or parole.  Only the fiery spheres cause this type of event on the ground. Based on this observation, it was a different species than the red fiery orbs.  The red fiery orbs move at an altitude of approximately 1000 to 2000 feet and much slower. I have observed 4 of the red fiery orbs over the past 2 years.  I only include that because you are most interested in the red fiery orbs.  The silence on the ground and the feeling of emptiness and/or parole seems to be a natural defense.  I have watched the trail of sightings of these red fiery orbs reported so I felt it not necessary to do so. The fact that this seems to be a different species, I felt more compelled to report the event. I felt as if it was looking for something very specific.  On a most personal note, I felt compelled to stay with it and keep watching.  I actually ran to clear the trees to keep watching.  I experienced a feeling of extreme enthusiasm and deep curiosity like a child would.  When I observed the object moving away from the area at an extreme high rate of speed I had a feeling of almost sadness.  Something close to abandonment.  The feeling was almost opposite the red fiery orbs. I have also observed other objects maneuvering in the sky in different states in the US.  The past 20 to 25 years I have observed several objects but in the past 2 years I have observed almost as many.  Activity of these objects has increased almost exponentially.",

I was outside driving the parking lot in the patrol vehicle, when I happened to look up and spot an object, triangular in shape, but rounded at the corners, moving across the sky very slowly.  There was no noise from the object, nor any lights emitting from it.  It was 11:45pm and the sky was partly cloudy.  I could see a few small clouds in the sky near the object, and could determine that the object was not a cloud as it was moving slightly faster than the surrounding clouds.  At night in the city, clouds have an orange color at the bottoms as the street lights of the city reflect off of them.  The object however didn\u2019t have the same coloration at the bottom.  It was of a darker grey color at the bottom, with a lighter gray color on the top.  I was viewing this object at its left side.   My patrol vehicle was facing west, and the object was moving east along with the clouds.  The object did not ! have a shiny surface from what I could see.  As far as the size of the object, it was at least the size of 5 school buses, maybe a bit larger.  It was very low in the sky and I could tell it was big.  I asked our camera operator in the dispatch office to see if they could get the object on camera, unfortunately they were not looking at the same direction as I was, and therefore I was the only witness.  The entire sighting lasted somewhere between 30 to 60 seconds.  It continued to head west until out of view.  I am still excited over this sighting even after nearly 90 minutes after the fact.   I truly hope someone else in the area saw this thing.  I have seen plenty of helicopters, planes, and satellites in the sky at night move across the sky.  This thing was none of those.",

      "story": "2 UFOs. High altitude surveillance or intelligent plasma balls? I noticed two small objects at a very high altitude, slightly east of where I was standing in Louisville, KY.  I was facing northeast and looking directly up while recording video on my iphone.  When the objects began moving closer overhead, they gained altitude.   I ran in to get my phone and recorded for a couple minutes, then I got binoculars and watched them remain overhead for about an additional 6-7 minutes.  Viewing with the naked eye they appear to twinkle very brightly, as though someone were reflecting the sun with a mirror; much brighter than the reflection off an airplane, and not like a flashing light but more of a shaky erratic effect and far brighter.   Through the binoculars they were very different.  They didn't appear to be reflecting light, they were just a bright citrusy yellow, like a tennis ball.  They were spherical with no wings.   The reason they appeared to twinkle is because they each seemed to be made of two spheres attached to each other, but rolling around each other in a rapid undulating and random orbit with no space in between the two parts.  This effect caused them to look elongated for short moments as the two spheres that made the individual objects were sometimes next to each other instead one on top of the other.   I tried to search for other reports of similar objects, but most were at night.  Some web sites talked about plasma orbs but I am not sure because the color was consistent.  Whatever they were, they seemed to be intelligently driven, because they stayed together and once they were overhead they didn't leave, as though they were looking back! (no voice to skull technology or other communication used on me, sorry)  This is not the first time (I assume by the naked eye view) I have seen one of these.  A few months ago, also during bright daylight, I saw one while walking into a gas station.  I watched it for 3-4 minutes, twinkling brightly but not moving at all, until a cloud covered it.  The two on the recent occasion disappeared behind chemtrails that were drifting.  A cold front had just moved through and we had surprisingly clear skies (still have today).  The chemtrails have been very heavy here for months, lessening on most weekends.  I also captured an excellent shot of a sun halo, which I have seen many times in the last couple months.\u00a0 If you have any information or insight, please respond.  If I'm going to keep seeing these things I'd like to understand their nature better.",

Clearly it was not an airplane as I live close to an airport and there were 2 planes in the sky around the same time.

This sighting happened during the summer and a few years after the passing of my father, which would put it in July or August of 1997.  I'm thinking it was August because my initial thought, when I saw this UFO, was that it must be a bundle of helium balloons that must have gotten away from someone at the Kentucky State Fair (KSF).  The KSF normally begins in mid August and last about eleven days.  The sighting happened about four miles to the east from the KSF, which would put it down wind.  I wanted to take a picture of it so I ran in our house and grabbed a 35mm disposable camera.  Fortunately, the object was still there when I got back, and I was able to get a photo of it. The object appeared to \"Boil\" in slow motion or constantly changed shape.  It continually drifted east as I watched it, and after a minute or two a jet airliner flew past and at that moment the object instantly vanished.  The closest thing I can compare it to was the \"Nellis AFB UFO\" video that's out there on YouTube.  The object seemed to be about 1,000 to 2,000 feet in altitude.   I'm starting to get older and just wanted to share this with the world.  I'm e-mailing a photo image called \"UFO1.jpg\".

The following is a testimonial of my UFO sighting that occurred in Louisville, KY on Tuesday, September 28th, 2018, between 8:26 PM and 8:30 PM (timestamp on video). I had just exited I-264E, Exit 5A towards Campground road.  While traveling on Ralph Ave, I noticed what appeared to be a meteor falling in the sky.  It was traveling at roughly the same speed as the jets that fly by.  To give perspective, if I were standing (I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d) and reached my hand out, its tail would measure ~1.5-2\u201d from thumb to pointer finger and it would take ~6-8 seconds to travel that same ~1.5-2\u201d. I pulled my SUV over at the employee entrance to the Dow Chemical Plant (at 4300 Camp Ground Road) to shoot the video clip.  While recording the video, I start to receive a call (and thus stop recording), I accept the call in the car and drive off, heading south-west on Camp Ground Road.  Interestingly enough, I see what appears to be another meteor quite a distance off in the NW direction that seemed to be leaving its tail in a curve up or spiral-like formation.  I could see both simultaneously.  I did not catch this on film but wanted to bring it up regardless. When I arrived at my friend\u2019s house, I began telling him about the meteor and was trying to describe it\u2019s fiery tail.  I was zoomed in to the meteor when I noticed it.  A black dot blazes by the meteor at impossible speeds, in comparison to fighter jets like those that appear at Thunder Over Louisville.  Slowing the video down and panning back and forth I actually discover another UFO that crosses above the meteor a second before the other.  This was shot on an iPhone X, and you can\u2019t really see it unless you zoom in\u2014but it appears to be a saucer-shaped vessel. I was previously a skeptic, but since I recorded this video myself?  I\u2019m a believer now.",
