      "story": "PHOENIX LIGHT OVER SCOTTSDALE IN 1991 I HAVE WITHOUT A DOUBT & SWEAR ON MY LIFE & THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY, THAT I TOO HAVE SEEN THESE LIGHTS AND IT CHILLS ME EVERYTIME I SEE A REPORTING ABOUT THEM.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE TO MY STORY IS THAT THE DATE THAT I HAVE SEEN THEM IS ABOUT 4 YEARS PRIOR TO YOUR SIGHTING.  I HAVE SEARCHED FOR DATES ONLINE BUT HAVE SEEN NOTHING DURING THIS TIME.  NOW AS A RESULT OF MY FINDINGS, I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO TELL SOMEBODY.  I JUST CANT BELIEVE NOBODY ELSE HAS REPORTED THESE LIGHTS DURING THAT TIME PERIOD BECAUSE WHAT I SAW WAS ENORMOUS! HOW COULD ANYBODY MISS IT?  CURRENTLY, I RESIDE IN SARASOTA, FLORIDA, BUT FOR A BRIEF TIME, FROM 1990-1991, I LIVED IN SCOTTSDALE, AZ.  AND FROM 1992 TO 2004 I LIVED IN THE FAR NORTH SUBURBS OF CHICAGO.  I WAS AT THE CORNER OF SCOTTSDALE ROAD AND E. SHEA BLVD. AT THE NE CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION IS/WAS A \"MOBILE\"  ((sic.  Mobil)) GAS STATION.  WHILE I WAS FILLING UP MY CAR WITH GAS, I SAW THESE RED LIGHTS IN A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING IN A \"V\" SHAPE IN WHAT LOOKED VERY CLOSE AND MOVING VERY SLOWLY!!! BECAUSE THE AREA SITS AT SORT OF A HIGHER ELEVATION OVERLOOKING THE PHOENIX, TEMPE & MESA AREAS, THE LIGHTS SEEMED ALMOST EYE LEVEL.  YOU DID LOOK UP SLIGHTLY BUT THESE LIGHTS SEEMED NO MORE THAN ABOUT 1 MILE AWAY IN DISTANCE AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT A HALF A MILE LONG OR LONGER IN SIZE.  THE OBJECT MOVED IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION AND MADE ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND WHAT-SO-EVER. THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO SOUND IS WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION.  I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF AMBER LIGHTS, WHICH I DON\u2019T BELIEVE IS WHAT I SAW.  I BELIEVE I SAW RED LIGHTS.  ALSO, I HAVE HEARD THE MENTION OF FLARES. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT I SAW.  THIS MAINTAINED A CONSTANT ELEVATION IN A VERY SLOW EASTERLY DIRECTION.  I WAS IN SO MUCH DISBELIEF THAT I DIDN\u2019T HEAR ANYBODY ELSE AROUND ME MAKING COMMENTS THAT I HAD TO ASK AN OLDER GENTLEMAN, WHOME WAS WALKING OUT OF THE GAS STATION AFTER PAYING I ASSUME, IF HE KNEW WHAT THOSE LIGHTS WERE.  HE DID SORT OF A DOUBLE TAKE, ANSWERED, \"I DON\u2019T KNOW,\" PROCEEDED TO GET IN HIS CAR STARING AT THE LIGHTS AND DROVE OFF. I WAS ABOUT 23 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME, AND I REMEMBER THINKING, \"WELL IF HE DIDN\u2019T THINK IT WAS ANY BIG DEAL, THEN IT MUST NOT BE,\" SO I PROCEEDED TO GET IN MY CAR AND LEAVE TO GO TO MY GIRLFRIENDS HOUSE AT THE TIME IN MCCORMICK RANCH.  I THINK I KEPT AN EYE ON THE LIGHTS FOR A WHILE AS I WAS DRIVING BUT AFTER THAT I CAN\u2019T REMEMBER WHEN I STOPPED LOOKING.  I REMEMBER TELLING MY GIRLFRIEND ABOUT IT WHEN I WALKED IN HER HOUSE AND SHE CHANGED THE SUBJECT AND I NEVER SEEN ANYTHING ON THE NEWS THAT EVENING ABOUT IT, SO IT WAS FORGOTTEN UNTIL ABOUT 1997 WHEN I SAW THE FIRST REPORTS OF THE LIGHTS ON TELEVISION.  I REMEMBER SEEING THE REPORTS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND FEELING THE HAIR STAND UP ON THE BACK OF MY NECK. I WONDERED, \"NOW HOW DO I TELL SOMEBODY MY STORY WITHOUT THEM THINKING THAT I AM NUTS?\"  WELL, I NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT MUCH BUT, I TOLD MY FUTURE WIFE AND I RECEIVED THE TYPICAL RESPONSE I GUESS ANY CRACK POT MIGHT GET, \"OH, COOL OR THAT\u2019S NICE.\"  SO AGAIN, I PUSHED IT ASIDE.  BUT IT IS REALLY EATING AT ME NOW TO TELL SOMEBODY.  SO HERE I AM.  I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY FINANCIAL GAIN OR RECOGNITION.  I JUST WANTED AN EAR TO HEAR MY SIDE.

      "story": "On Halloween Night 2005, 3 Lights in shape of a triangle moving over Scottsdale, AZ. Well walking up Granite Reef, about 1/4 mile north of Indian School, with my 2 youngest daughters I saw what I thought was 3 stars in the shape of a triangle far off in the western sky.  Something about them caught my attention, and then I realized it was that they were moving towards us, all at once, together, as one it seemed.  I watched them for a few mins until I was sure of what I was seeing, then I told my daughters to look up and they saw them/it too.  They slowly came almost directly over our heads, and as they got near to us they started to bank and turn towards the south.  I didn't realize it at first but as they got closer to us they were also descending. I could see any edge or shape to this craft, but it was blocking out the view of the sky and stars behind it as it moved...  As it straightened out towards the south after making the turn, it wobbled once or twice and then shot off to the south 3 to 5 miles (estimate), also elevating as it moved, and then just stopped.  It covered this distance in the blink of an eye, but it also seemed like maybe who ever or what ever was controlling this thing, wasn't having the results they wanted.  The Movement was somewhat erratic and unstable.  Changing elevation and direction and stopping and going, and that wobble before it moved quickly to the south, just didn't seem as controlled as something that could move that fast and that quite should be.  I don't know what it was, but I have never seen a plane or helicopter that could move like that and not make a sound.",

Well by now I had pulled over and we had gotten out of the car when remembering that I had a camera on my cell phone and it was better than nothing I was scrambling to find it in the bottom of my purse, but it was too late as the object started to really move rapidly and just as I raised the phone to take a picture of it  the tail end of it disappeared behind the peak of the mountain. I called a couple of news stations to see if it may have been reported by anyone else and apparently it had not, I also got on the internet to look up photos of other sightings around the world and I did find a couple that look exactly like the one we saw.

      "story": "3 Blinking Lights in Loose Formation over Camelback Mountain, Phoenix I was sitting on the porch having a smoke when I noticed two twinkling lights off to the west. They had to be over Camelback Mountain (8 miles away), or maybe further west towards Glendale, it all depended on their altitude. They were in an area of the night sky that was void of stars, probably due to pollution. This is why I knew they did not belong there.  Upon further visual exploration of the scene, I noticed a third twinkling light at a lower altitude. The three would get brighter and move around a bit, but they would stay in the same general area. Sometimes they would dim to the point that they were impossible to see, only to brighten and twinkle once more. They did not move for nearly an hour, after which time tiredness dectated that I go to sleep.  Forty five minutes into watching these lights, or around 12:45, there was what I deemed to be an aircraft with a bright red flashing light, maybe a helicopter, that flew past all three of these objects. It should also be noted that these objects were present before I noticed them, and they probably lasted after I went to bed. I am writing this report after having come inside from watching the event.  I am visiting family for the week, and am leaving tomorrow. I did hear of a 'second round' of Phoenix Lights that took place a week ago (4/21/08)on the news last week. I think these lights behaved similarly to the ones I saw on many local news stations, however, they did not change positions such as the ones from a week ago, the lights tonight were relatively stationary.

I like to look at the different planes flying over our heads when I hear them, but when I was looking at a plane, I saw a white speck about an inch away from the sun according to me standing on the ground. It looked like a star and was really high. It didn't seem to move at all for about 30 minutes. I showed my dad, and he didn't know what it was. When we got home, I found a pair of binoculars and tried to observe the object from our backyard. I couldn't make out what it totally looked like because the binoculars kept moving a little. But I could tell it didn't look like a weather balloon or an aircraft. By then, it actually was moving but at a very very slow pace. It now seemed about 3-4 inches away from the sun. I then got our telescope out and tried to focus on it. When I got it, the image was really blurry but now up close it had a goldish shade to it. I picked up my binoculars again and looked at it, and it looked the same as before. Then when I tried to focus the telescope on it again, I couldn't find it again, but it was still in the sky. Me and my dad have witnessed a similar object about a year ago, but was in a different part of the sky. Who knows, maybe it was the same UFO revisiting.",

It was in my direct line of sight and flew toward the southeast. it only took about five to seven seconds to pass. it was large compared to other objects that had been in the area. It looked to be the size of a eraser head and dark blue, almost a grey color; much darker than the light sky. what was interesting to me was that it was so large , but so high in the sky and it flew past much faster than the planes i had been observering earlier. I was alone and called to my friend inside the house, by the time they came outdoors it had already moved from my view and out of sight. I thought it was strange and questioned my friend , since he is from the area.",

At around 5:20 AM MST (give or take a few minutes) I looked up in the clear sky and saw a very brite \u201cstar\u201d.  At first I thought it was Venus, but immediately realized it was in the northern sky, and could not be Venus.  Besides, it appeared brighter than Venus.  I immediately assumed it was an airplane and looked down as I continued walking.  After a few steps, I looked up again.  Instead of an airplane, I saw what appeared to be a star where I had seen the \u201cairplane\u201d.  Not a bright star, just an average star.  I then watched it as it quickly faded away, in a matter of 10 seconds or so, until nothing was there.  It did not appear to be moving, just fading away.  In complete silence.  I have never seen an airplane look like that.  First of all, when an airplane is that bright, it is coming toward you.  Second of all, it takes longer to fade out of sight when it is flying away.  And you usually see a flashing strobe light or the red and green wing lights.  But this just looked like a normal star that was fading away.  Rather than a UFO, I\u2019d say this looked more like a star had just blown up and disappeared.  It was located in the northern sky to the left and below Polaris, forming an equilateral triangle with another star below  and to the right of Polaris.",

Just outside Scottsdale, AZ we seen a light, VERY BRIGHT, behind a desert mountain, and it lit up the background of the mountain so bright it lit up the entire area.  We both said, Holly ****, and tried to say that is MUST be just a helicopter taking off behind the mountain, and there MUST be an airport there, so we hit the odometer on the truck and continued to drive slowly down the road.  The light started to get brighter, and brighter, and in an INSTANT the light (WHITE IN COLOR) shot straight up into the sky, and defied all laws of gravity as it streaked across the sky as fast as a shooting star, but it went UP, and after a ways, then turned right (horizontal). My brother and I couldn't believe our eyes?  We did continue on the the lake. (Bartlett Lake, AZ), near Horseshoe Lake, and fished the morning and afternoon.  On the way home we decided to stop and get out where we set the odometer, and we were still MILES FROM TOWN!  As we noticed in the daylight the mountain that was lit up earlier that morning could be seen as we drove back to Scottsdale. There was NO AIRPORT, and there was NO Buildings, or houses for MILES.  We decided NOT to tell anyone as we feared we would be called CRAZY or that we MADE IT UP?  I only now tell this to whoever reads this, so maybe SOMEONE ELSE seen the same thing back then?  Maybe this happened and was REPORTED BACK THEN? The date is approximate, as years have gone by, but I am sure it was the spring time, and I am SURE of the time in the morning!  We never saw a SHAPE of a craft, but the size of light was beyond belief!  We both had been in helicopters and airplanes, and had seen them in the air at night MANY TIMES BEFORE? This was something else?  I hope this may be confirmed by other witnesses?  We would like to KNOW if what we saw was truly a UFO?  We both know it was NOT FROM THIS EARTH? Thank you for listening.

I live in north Scottsdale and the window where i saw the UFO was facing south.  At about 2 am earlier tonight on July 14th 2008, i went to close my window and i saw what appeared to be a red cloud in the sky hovering over Scottsdale.  Upon closer examination i saw what appeared to be a red inner glowing light and there reddish-orange cloud that surrounded it.  The shape of the cloud was a circle and it flickered with the inner light.  The feeling of seeing that is one that i will never forget.  My heart started to beat rapidly and my mind started racing.   I didn't know whether to wake up my parents or call my friends to check it out. I tried to call a friend of mine, but he did not answer.  I decided not to wake up my parents, because they would have just said i was crazy and told me to go back to sleep.   I didn't want to lose sight of the object either.  Anyway this object just stayed in one spot the whole time, i did not see it fly vertically. The only movement that could have happened was for it to move south, The cloud was strongest in the sky for about 5 minutes and than progressively got less bright over the few minutes. The weird thing was the shape of the cloud didn't get smaller.  It was still huge and it just seemed to get less bright until it vanished. The size was huge, it looked almost as big as a full moon does. In conclusion i want to say that i saw something tonight that i have never seen before in my life.   I am convinced that the object in the sky that i saw was way too big and way too bright to be anything that our military has disclosed.",

      "story": "Emerging, pivoting array of lighted objects. I am filing this report on behalf of my son who witnessed the event.  At about 20:30 on January 4, 2000, (est.), my son was in the vicinity of Jomax Rd. and 62nd St. looking toward the south at the lights of Phoenix in the distance.  The day had been overcast with some rain, which had stopped in the evening.   A light at the extreme right side of his field of view caused him to look in that direction, west.  He witnessed a vivid green circular object descending at about a 30 degree angle, the object was the size of a dime at arms length.   At a height of about 200 feet above the ground the object stopped and a second identical object then appeared as if out of the first and proceeded on the same path and speed until it was about 12 diameters from the first, then it too stopped.   A third identical object immediately appeared, traveled the same distance, stopped, and a fourth identical object repeated the process until it reached the 12 diameter distance.  The moment the fourth object stopped the entire string of four objects then pivoted on the central axis of their array with the last object appearing closest to my son with the original object the most distant.  The array swung in such a fashion that it became parallel to the ground, forming an east-west line.   At this point my son was able to see that there were still four objects even though they overlapped each other from his vantage point.  Within a second or two all the objects simply vanished, followed a few seconds later by two loud \"sonic booms\".   At this point my son, then 16, made a hasty retreat to our home. He described the objects as having even illumination across the entire surface with distinct edges.  He described the green as similar to the green in a traffic signal.  The movement of the objects was very smooth as each emerged from the previous one.  His estimate was that the objects were about 1/4 mile from his location.  A set of electrical transmission towers runs on a southeast to northwest line, about 1/2 mile west of this location.   When I questioned him about the possibility of some sort of ball lightning or electrical plasma, he dismissed this possibility stating that the objects were never in the vicinity of the transmission lines.  He stated that the objects somewhat reminded him of the warning balls attached to power lines in the vicinity of airports.   Since the objects retained their circular shape as they pivoted, he made the assumption that they were spheres. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

Some how I focused on it and realized all three stars were moving in unison and coming right at me?    Eventually it was right over head, and turned 90* to the south.  As it was approaching me it was dropping in elevation, until it seemed like it was relatively very low and over head.  Then as it turned south, it seemed to try to elevate again?  As it tried to elevate it wobbled.  Finally it shot off at a high rate of speed, but seemed to stop about 15 - 20 miles to the south at that point it seemed to drop out of sight. One of my girls didn't bring her glasses, so she couldn't see it, my other daughter ((name deleted)) saw it rise and go to the south.  It was silent and seemed to have definition but I really couldn't make out anything but the 3 lights.  It did black out the sky I think, but it was impossible to see where its edge stopped and started?  It went both slow and fast, but the wobble tells me it's human made, Alien craft would be flawless... I have also seen other UFO type objects, both at night and in the day in AZ..  I filmed a UFO 05-06-2011 seen in Surprise and Gold Canyon AZ.  This seen twice that day with a witness also.  I saw what I think was the Superstition Lights on a day a few weeks back, but not sure it was a craft and not just a light. http://youtu.be/UgAVCwmB7qE  --((name deleted))",

Three to Five flaming, descending objects seen two consecutive nights with consistent, peculiar behavior. They appeared on 10/28/2011 and 10/29/2011 between 8:00 and 9:00 both nights, in the sky east of Scottsdale, Arizona.  On 10/28/2011 they were further north than on 10/29/2011. Specific times of sight were 8:39pm on 10/28, and 8:15pm on 10/29. Flight behavior shows descent, but with sudden, curving and complete shifts in directional movement. There is no organized formation. They initially appear with long streaks of flame, already in a steep descent. The relation between the \u2018flames\u2019 and objects are like that of a comet- so judging from the flames, which seem to only come from one side of these objects, I could determine a curved silhouette. Full shapes, however, were not seen. The flame will go out on one at a time, leaving a small white light, then spontaneously reignite with an equal amount of fervor. Each flame and object seem uniform in size. The colors of the flame range from white, yellow, and orange. No other lights on the objects were seen, other than the single light when the flame temporarily extinguishes. Both nights these objects descend into darkness, or have fallen from view, just before they drop below the horizon line.",

As before, the UFO stopped in mid-air for some time and moved around slightly before performing an impossible 180 degree turn and quickly returning East from where it came. I was able to call nearby family this time, whereas last time they didn't pick up the phone in time. They were able to see the UFO before it left this time, so I increased the number of witnesses to three. If you can gain access to any weather, visibility, &quot;sunrise&quot;, or traffic cameras that point toward the Superstition Mountains and look out across the reservation - you will find footage. It glowed brighter than any stars, and brighter than any aircraft. Specific times were 11:05pm and 11:25pm. Additionally, the last plane to leave Sky Harbor International Airport in this direction was at 11:05pm.  The pilot, seemingly upon seeing the craft, executed a tight turn South. I did not see another plane or helicopter in the air until about 11:45pm.

It was something unnatural, not of this world. I went out with my dog on a leash to wait for my boyfriend in  his driveway, which is relatively long.   We live in an area of rattlesnakes, so I did not want to venture into the area of the driveway that was not illuminated by the yard lights.   At the end of the driveway, I saw I could only make out was a person wearing a white shirt, yet this \u201cperson\u201d lacked 3d perspective.  It was sort of a flat presence, sort of like a big plastic bag being flung into the air and blowing in the wind, yet it was not moving, it was still. I still could not figure out what this was.  Happened very quickly \u2013 maybe a one-minute time span.  My dog also alerted, and he was also aware there was something at the end of the driveway.  Well, whatever it was appeared to sort of bend over and though I could see now eyes or anything, I got the distinct impression that it was at that time this object became aware of me.  There was no mistaken that it had \u201cseen\u201d me, perceived me, it knew of my presence.   Again, not through any senses that such as we have here on earth. I am getting chills just retelling it, it was so eerie.  I was moving a bit closer and sort of trying to adjust my eyes to focus, when all of a sudden, it jetted off.  I use the term \u201cjetted\u201d because that is what it did.  From a standstill position to what seemed the speed of a car racing by at 100 mph.  It was gone, across the street and into the brush. When my boyfriend got home, I explained to him what I had seen. Well, he offered explanations, but none was satisfactory as I experienced it and I felt in my core it was something unnatural.  Well, unnatural to this earth.  Since last night, I have been second-guessing myself, but the point remains, I saw what I saw.  It is the nature of whatever beast this is to make you thing you were being delusional, imagining things, etc. At any rate, do you have any insight into what this could have been and perhaps tell me if other people have had similar experiences?

      "story": "Irregular hexagon with 3 big bright lights emitting beams I was outside my home smoking a cigarette at approximately 11:38 three very big bright white lights appeared out of the northern sky moving south east not more then 3 miles from where I was standing.  It came out of no where, flying at no more then an altitude of about 3000 feet.  Each light had about 15 foot beams trailing from each one it appeared to be some mechanism of propulsion; every time the it turned they leaned the opposite direction of the turn.  It made an air blowing like noise it came within 1/4 mile of me and my house.  I got a very good look at it once the beams were facing westward when it turned.  The object was flat it was sort of pentagon in shape but not equal lengths, the front where the lights were; was a very wide broad point the sides towards the back were at a much narrower angle and much shorte, then a straight line connecting those for the very back.   The object was black except for on the back it was grey- silver like a vent type thing on that straight line back, it moved quite slow actually but in no way resembled a stealth bomber other then the nose of it and its flatness but had no defined wings and a very funky back end.   After passing by my house it proceeded west for about another mile before completely vanishing into thin air.  I searched the sky and could see no other aircraft of any kind in the sky.

They were larger and brighter than aircraft lights.  They were quite a distance away, yet they were as large as the light on a helicopter that flew over my head at around the same time (the helicopter had nothing to do with the sighting, its just a size comparison).  The lights were a minimum of 10 miles away, so they were large and bright enough to clearly see.  They were mostly stationary and they formed a non-equilateral triangle.   The right-most light then started to head to the right (west) and it went out after about 10 seconds.  The middle light did the same thing about 30 seconds later.  The third light remained stationary in the sky for about 2 minutes, and then it faded out, but as it did, another bright orange light appeared to the left of it.  The fourth and final light remained stationary in the sky for another f! ew minutes, and then it faded out. I have an iPhone 5 video of the event that I'd like to upload, but it may take me a few days.",

The two orange objects flew silently at a diagonal toward us under the clouds, so they were pretty low, like low flying aircraft would be.  No sound.   I got my binoculars and we both saw the same things:  Cylinder shape objects with bright orange fire burning inside, then another bright orange light of same color up to the right in the cylinder, but round shape. The 2 objects flew to a point over us.  They hesitated for a few moments, than one flew straight behind us out of sight while the second one flew away at approximately a 45 degree angle to our right.  Again, they were completely silent. We both looked at each other in amazement wondering aloud and comparing our sighting with each other.   While comparing out sighting I looked up at the direction the two objects had come from and there was a third identical object.  This one was much lower and couldn\u2019t have been more than 500 feet over us.  It flew directly towards us and then hovered directly overhead.  A few moments later it also flew off silently at a 45 angle to our right.  We were both to slow in thinking to record this event.

The second I turned, and began to walk down the street, (was walking east), I saw a large fire orange colored object, it basically looked like a giant fireball, or a miniature sun, but was slightly off from a perfect sphere.   I knew immediately it wasn't a plane, a star, or a planet, because of its size and distinct orange hue.  It was about the size of a marble.  I couldn't tell exactly how far away it was, but it appeared to be inside the atmosphere at least, not in space.  It was moving very very slowly, straight down.   I did manage to capture about a minute and a half of it, but on my cellphone the quality isn't great.   I thought it might had been a missile of some sort at the time so I was kind of panicked, and since it was moving down, my camera is shaky for some of the footage because I am walking, so I don't lose sight of it.   The sky wasn't even fully dark at the time so you can tell even in this bad footage that this object shouldn't be there, its just too bright, even on my cellphone camera.   At the end of the footage you can see it begin to blink, it did this several times before shrinking into a much much smaller, yellow sphere.   It still followed its path straight down, until it passed the tree and building line, and I lost sight of it. I wish I had better footage, or more information, but...   That's all I've got.  Oh I also forgot to add the object was dead silent.  Shortly after the event, I saw multiple unmarked planes fly in that direction, not all together, but one at a time, about every 30 seconds to a minute apart.",

      "story": "Not the Phoenix Lights, but the Scottsdale Lights. My journey started near Greenway road and 56th street at around 8pm.  It was dark outside on March 13, 1997.  I needed to head out to CompUSA which was located near Scottsdale Road and Shea Blvd.  I was heading north on 56th street and I made a left on Shea Blvd which had me heading east towards Scottsdale road.  As I was driving east on Shea, when I got to about 60th Place, I noticed a couple lights coming around on the east side of the McDowell mountains on my left.  They were higher the peak of the mountain which is 3,900 feet, my estimate would be somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 feet. As I drove to about 64th street, I noticed about 4 lights spaced at what I would estimate about a 1 or 2 blocks apart.  My immediate thoughts were these are some military helicopters because the speed they were travel was way to slow compared to airplanes.  Scottsdale Airpark is right in the same area and I\u2019ve seen hundreds of planes coming in and out of that airport and none ever flown in that formation.  And I would not say commercial airplanes because none have every flown in that direction either. I kept looking out to the left out my window and counted about 7 lights now.  All evenly spaces and was in kind of an arch, like the arch of an old fashion bow.  Totally strange to me because I have never seen any lights like this before, so I was excited to think it was a convoy of military helicopters. When I made it to my destination and got out of my car, I looked up and watched the lights come and pass right over me.  2 of the 7 lights went right over my head.  When they went over, I heard ZERO sounds.  Just a light that sputtered and it was completely black around the lights.   I watched as the 3 light went over and in my head, I said this is really strange because I hear NOTHING.  The lights traveled very slowly.  I waited more than 5 minutes in the parking lot for the first light to travel over and then probably 3 to 5 minutes for the second light. I headed into the store and did my shopping.  Never once did I think of it as a UFO.  I used to watch XFiles at that time and didn\u2019t think of taking a picture.  I was thinking they were silent helicopters that ran about a mile or more in length.   After about 20 to 30 minutes in the store, I came out and the lights were gone. It wasn\u2019t for a day or two later when I heard the news and it made me think different about what I saw.  The strange part, these lights were in northeast Scottsdale.  Not southwest Phoenix like the Phoenix lights were reported and known for. This event, these lights are burned into my memory like it was yesterday.",

PD))   Both yesterday (12/31/15) and tonight (1/1/16) we have seen a star-like object in the southeast sky as we went on a walk.  It caught my attention because it looks larger that a normal star and was twinkling different colors - blue, green, white, and red.  It behaved like the star as it moved higher in the sky as the night went on. I lost interest as I thought it must have been just a star.   Tonight I went for a walk with my parents and saw it again.  I pointed it out and they thought it was very strange. My whole family lived hear O'Hare in Chicago for a majority of our lives making us used to aircraft. We got out the binoculars and four of us (me, my parents, my boyfriend) viewed it through the binoculars all seeing the same thing - distinct red, blue, green, white lights - my dad said it reminded him of LEDs because they were so vivid and distinct. I could also see the halo around the object changing color with the object. My parents said they've never seen an! ything like it. It was higher than the planes that had taken off from the PHX airport (south, southwest of where we are, which flew below within the same view).  This is near 101 off Indian Bend Road. I am visiting my parents from Chicago. They said it is over the Native Amer Reservation east of Scottdale. I would like to know if this could be disproven, but everything man-made that flies doesn't really fit. Also, it doesn't fit as a star considering the distinct lighting. I also have video, but it's so grainy and it only looks like a star. Please let me know if anyone has an idea or if you would like video.",

Scottsdale, AZ, higher than the rest of the valley 7:30-8:30pm  I stepped outside to see three large bright lights in the sky in a triangle formation.  I was driving but every time I looked they had rotated while staying in a triangle.  If you had a full moon and put a point on the top and sides of a full moon, I would say this is how far they were from one another.  By the time I pulled over there was only one light left; I told my boyfriend I wasn\u2019t going anywhere until this light disappeared.  It was not above me in the sky, but south of me low on the horizon. Another bright light reappeared nearby the other.  One left its location and slowly crossed the sky.  It decreased in brightness and traveled east to west.  If you split the sky in 18 sections, it would cross one of these in a little less than a minute.  Planes flew by but were fast and not nearly as bright as even the traveling UFO.  The light they emitted was pure white.  When they traveled they usually got dimmer.  I took off my glasses and the only light I could see in the sky, including stars, were these lights. We starred at them freaking out with excitement for an hour.  They would occasionally disappear and reappear in a nearby location.  My boyfriend and I argued of what he thought was a plane at about 8 o\u2019clock.  It had two very dim white lights flashing very close in proximity and moved faster than the UFO\u2019s before.  I convinced him that it was a UFO because the lights were not consistent in spacing.  They also would fly back and forth from east to west. Also I do not know if it was just me because I was wearing glasses, but they individually appeared to be elongated vertically.  The light looked like it came to a small point and expanded to the rest of the light. It was very subtle, but he said he could kind of see it too. We ended up leaving before they were gone.  At midnight I was back on the road and I could see one bright UFO.  A couple minutes passed and it was gone; I didn\u2019t see anything else this night.",

There were no clouds from horizon to horizon in any given direction.  The temperature was in the low nineties.  I was in a patrol vehicle at my place of employment traveling in a northern direction and drifting slightly east.  To the north west of my locating about a half a mile away there are some small peaks that are maybe a thousand feet higher in elevation than my location.   These peaks are strung out east to west. I glance at the peaks and saw a round dark shadow that followed the surface contour of the landscape moping from east to west.  I only saw it for a couple of seconds before it passed the most western peak. What was strange about it was that the sun at that time in the morning is almost straight up and the peaks are very close to my location.  I immediately stopped (less than five seconds) and got out of the vehicle looking for an object that may have caused the round shadow, but there was nothing to be seen anywhere in the sky in my general location. There was nothing between the sun and those peaks.  There was nothing moving out of the area heading west as far as the eye could see.  Many miles to the west (about twenty miles) I could see Sky Harbor International traffic along the I-17 corridor flying from north to south, but those shadows would be cast further to the west.  I had seen shadows before across those peaks caused by aircraft but they moved slower and had the definite shape of an aircraft.  This was round and moving very fast.  I estimate the size of the shadow to have been about sixty to eighty feet in diameter. End of Report",

I noticed there were no other navigation lights.  No red or green nor a flashing white. this flight path was west to east and would have to be 10 to 30 thousand feet.  No contrail was observed.  No sound heard. I would describe the light as very bright like a helicopter landing light.  The light was to my south and between 75 to 80 degrees, almost overhead. Within about 1 minute there was a plane making an east to west pass almost on a reciprocal course and altitude, all lights were visible, you could hear it, there was no comparison between the two. I spent 2 years active duty in the navy.  I was trained in lookout techniques, and was a radar operator in the combat information center for most of my service.",

I rarely drink and do not do any drugs.  I am also an amateur astronomer with a small scope, and because the airport is fairly close, a plane watcher with binocs on the outside table at all times.  The point is that I am intelligent, sober, rational, skeptical, and I can recognize planes, man-made satellites (have seen 3), and stars/planets.  What I saw was not one of these. On 4/12, at 10:30 PM, took dogs outside for the normal business.  As usual I looked at the stars.  Visibility was good \u2013 a bit hazy at about 20 degrees and below from a dust storm earlier in the day but generally clear directly overhead with major constellations visible.   Saw a bright flash (about as bright as landing lights turning on but much farther away and not in the flight pattern) due west at about a 70 degree elevation.  The light was flashing at 15 second intervals (I measured it) which is too infrequent even for a plane at cruising altitude.  It was moving south for about 3 minutes but moving too slow for an aircraft and much much too slow for a satellite.  It also did not seem to be moving in a straight line (somewhat difficult to tell due to infrequency of flashes).  Over this time the light gradually dimmed and took-on a slight reddish hue before it became too dim to see. On 4/13 at 8:30 PM went outside for some fresh air.  Looked up and saw the identical scene with these changes:  I did not see initial flash and the direction was south/southeast.  The sky was much clearer tonight. Also, about 8 weeks ago I was up very early 3:00AM to catch a flight.  Outside with the dogs.  Looked up and saw a moving, steady light (no flashing or colored lights) about the size and magnitude of a typical star.  It was moving slower than satellites I have seen before, and seemed much too high for an aircraft (my first thought was that it was a private jet a high altitude).  The light moved straight south covering about a 20 degree arc and then quickly faded at about Orion\u2019s shoulders. The third sighting in the list very well could have been a satellite, but the other two were definitely neither planes, satellites, nor meteorites.",

Scottsdale, AZ 85260 - Near Shea Boulevard and 101 Loop (Highway).                    Approximately 8:30 pm Saturday, April 14th, 2018. At approximately 8:30 pm Saturday, April 14th, 2018 I arrived at my home, parked my car and stepped to the backyard. I am in a neighborhood that is dark, does not have streetlights and the properties are all close to 1 acre plus in size, the night is clear, still has some suspended dust particles in the lower atmosphere/sky that can affect the color like a filter. I unplugged the lights that illuminate a Paolo Verde tree in my backyard.  I looked to the South West and saw the \u201cBelt of Orion\u201d the significantly identifiable constellation that I recall my children always pointing out to me.  I was alone and enjoying the dark sky and the stars straight up and to the north. After seeing the \u201cNorth Star\u201d as directed by the \u201cBig Dipper\u2019s\u201d outer ladle stars I turned back to view towards the South East and saw a magenta colored object with sequential lights, like a 1970 Ford Thunderbird with its right turn signal on, observed rolling from my left to right moving at a steady swift speed in a Southern and lower trajectory; maybe below 10,000 to 15,000 feet. The object seemed to stay on the same altitude in my field of vision. The lights were red and then bright white and the background of the lights lit up in magenta (magenta, somewhere midway between blue and red); it was very pretty and very different.  The lights where arranged in similarity to a shallow bowl, curving upwards and at an apex point above there was a point that was not lit but visible with some opaque connection from the curved lit zone upward to that apex point. The sequential movement of the light created a visual image that made the object seem to be spinning, however it was very quick and this was unlike anything I have seen in the sky before. I witnessed the sighting for about 5 to 10 seconds, then ran into my house and gathered my binoculars which were very close to the screen door to view.  I was excited to view the same outline however, the sequential movement of the lights changed to an \u201call on\u201d or all illuminated pattern but, the apex point (at the top of the curved bowl shape) and the outline of a structure was more evident. I quickly went back into my house to grab my camera that can zoom and potentially capture an image.  At first because the screen is very small and aligning the camera in the night with a moving object in the sky I didn\u2019t think I captured the image. However, I do have something on the camera. It is very small and only visible for about less than 1.5 seconds.  The camera shows a more blue in color but, I do not have a good way to review the video yet.  On the counter between 6 and 8 seconds, the small spot in the field of view on the top half of the screen shows, what I believe is the moving object described above.  It is very quick and very poor, the larger light was unfortunately one of my solar powered lawn lights.  I am willing to share the video, the sighting in the video is on the higher side of the field of view than the garden light I ended up targeting instead for the remainder of the shoot.",

Viewed from 33\u00b036\u201948\u201d N x 111\u00b052\u201935 W Viewed with a naked eye  Numerous unidentified \u201caircraft\u201d shaped objects above North Scottsdale, Sunday, August 5th, 2018, at 8:48 p.m. The initial object was a solid bright orange, not flashing, then the orange disappeared and was replaced by what appeared to be all dark with a spotlight being adjusted.  This object was moving NE to SW, then changed direction and moved W, it flew at increased and decreased pitch like a greater-than-less-than symbol. Several airplanes appeared shortly after and began flying towards the object, at which point three additional objects that appeared to look like Military Drones, as they were torpedo-shaped but with large bat or seagull shaped wings.  As it was dark outside, I determined shape by looking at the cast of the light.  Eventually a fourth object that was solely a golden Naples-yellow color appeared where previously I had identified Venus as being with the use of the SkyView Application, as if the lights were just turned on, and then the object began traveling quite slowly North to South. All of the objects with the exception of the identifiable aircraft were silent, and no wind sheer could be heard.  The initial object appeared to be around 15,000 feet high, while the other objects appeared to be above the 38,000ft altitude most commercial aircraft fly at. Then at 9:35pm what initially appeared to be a military aircraft, silently jettisoned across the sky very quickly, North to South, before eventually turning and heading East also seen from Scottsdale.  Though initially it appeared to be a military jet with traditional lighting for perhaps a Stealth plane or an F18 Hornet, then the lights suddenly vanished and a golden light overtook the silhouette of the aircraft and instead of traveling East it made a full loop very quickly as if traveling faster than anything I\u2019d ever seen before, at which point a loud guttural sound was heard, perhaps it was an antique military craft, but all observations do not support that theory.  Throughout the totality of the event a plethora of sounds could be heard from airplane, to jet sounds, to sounds similar to motor boats, as well as sounds similar to Electronic music synthesizers. The initial observer and his fianc\u00e9e  are a 34 year old man and a 33 year old woman ,residents of Scottsdale, who is originally from Chicago and recently moved to Arizona in 2017, initially moving to Wickenburg before moving to Scottsdale on 1/118.  The man is a graduate of Columbia College Chicago and has a degree in Art History and has a passion for art, fashion, photography, wildlife, poetry, literature, history, Geology, Lapidary, Nature, and Politics.  The woman studied Pre-Med at Northwestern University Chicago and received an additional degree in Creative Non-fiction from Pitzer College, California, she top shares many of the same interests, and they both work in high fashion retail management. The third observer is an Arizona native, 35 years old, with a history of drug abuse and extensive criminal background, the fourth observer is also an Arizona Native who works in Engineering and Refrigeration, lives in Scottsdale and enjoys off-roading.  He is 39 years of age.",
