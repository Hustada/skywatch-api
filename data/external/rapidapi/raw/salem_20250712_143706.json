As I was listening to a friend talk to a group of four of us, I saw a light as bright as the full moon but smaller in size, which was about 1/8 the size of the moon, travel in a perfectly straight line horizontally across the sky and disappeared into absolutely nothing.  There were no clouds and the moon was full and bright.  The light traveled faster than any airplane and was not a shooting star.  There was no tail or lagging light behind the object.  The size of the object was so large it could never be misinterpreted as an aircraft.  The manner at which it disappeared into thin air was a complete mystery.  I have never seen anything similar to this, and matter of fact have never seen anything other than aircraft and an occasional shooting star a handful of times.  As I yelled \u201cDid you guys see that?\u201d I actually startled everyone because they actually did not see what I had because it was behind them.  This is definitely a little scary, mysterious, and totally unexplainable.",

My self and two of my cousins were walking along the street heading west. We were going to have pizza. Ahead of us the houses thin out and there was a section of about two city blocks where there were no houses, just grass lots. Beyond that was a small unused strip mall,some fast food and other types of stores. Beyond that was Interstate 57. As we talked we noticed a string of red lights appear above the dark strip mall. We could make out a form that was darker than the night sky.  To me seemed round with the lights ringing the middle. I would say it was about 30-40 feet across.The object started to move very slowly to the north west. I remember we talked about what it could be, One of my cousins said it must be a helicopter to move so slowly and hover like that. About that time the lights went out. a few moments later a small private airplane crossed the sky to the south east. We could plainly hear its motor. That ruled out a helicopter. The object could still be made out as a dark spot in the sky. It moved west until it reached the interstate highway at which it moved lower and went north along the highway. We could plainly see the traffic moving under it. It went north along roadway until just about the exit/overpass at which time it tilted skyward and in a blur was gone. We were shocked and at this point we knew it was nothing we could point a finger at and say \"that was it\" We talked excitedly and ran to the pizza place. We had been there maybe three minutes. Standing in line to place our order when a man in his early 20's came running in. He was hysterical. He asked where the phone was, he had just chased a UFO on the interstate. People in line snickered and we stopped talking about it until we were seated. Obviously he had seen the same thing we had.

      "story": "A large, bright orange rectangle appeared in front of the mountains, changed shape and produced orbs. Just after midnight of the morning of September 5, 2007 I saw a bright orange rectangular object in the northeastern sky. At first I thought it was the moon seen through clouds, but the shape was too close to the horizon and in front of the Cascade range to have been the moon. And the shape was so unusual and so \u2018unnatural\u2019 that I was totally puzzled. As I watched for about the first 10 minutes, the object moved away back toward the northeast and disappeared.  I left my window for about five minutes but returned out of curiosity to see if the object had returned. As I looked, the object did begin to reappear but this time the shape changed to an actual triangle but retained its bright orange appearance. I decided to go quickly and get my binoculars that were in the car in the garage. I was not sure if the object would be there when I returned.  When I returned, perhaps within 30 seconds, with my binoculars, I was able to focus more clearly on the object. It was definitely a triangle and had moved closer moving toward the southwest. It stopped and stayed in one place and as I watched through the binoculars, three orb or globe-shaped spheres, all smaller in size than the object itself and seemingly \u2018colorless\u2019, emerged and moved around the object. Two of the orbs floated at the base of this triangle of light. The third remained somewhat stationary.  The now four objects remained in place for about 15 minutes and then seemed to drift back toward the northeast and finally disappeared altogether. I called our local police to see if anyone else had seen or reported what I had seen, but the police said that no other calls had been reported.  I do not know if I even believe in UFOs, but I have to say, I saw something I could not identify, it was flying and it was an object.",

Approximately three weeks ago, my mother, my 3-year-old son, and I were returning home from shopping at about 8:30 at night. We were on our back porch and we saw a red and orange, roundish mystery objest flying up above about a half mile away. We were all instantly enthralled with the object beacuse it had virtually no form, it was glowing, it was silent, it would stop in mid flight (float would be more like it), and then it would change direction and go in reverse. After about twenty seconds of watching it, the thing started dropping a few burning embers that would burn out before hitting the ground or trees. That was when it started getting really weirs. We thought whatever it was was going to crash but it keep hovering over head, moving very slowly. It continued to do so fo almost another minute and a half and then it started to drop quite a lot of burning embers to the ground (the object itself did not look like it was on fire at all) nad then it just disappeared. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen in my life and I am writing this because I saw an article in the local paper a couple weeks ago about different people witnessing the same thing.

      "story": "Triangular Shaped Object Seen on U.S. Rt. 50 This happened quite a few years ago, but I remember the details perfectly.  My girlfriend and I were traveling on US Rt. 50 heading east from Parkersburg to Clarksburg.  We were passing through (around) Salem when I noticed a large triangular-shaped object in the sky just above the horizon.  At first I thought it was an oil-rig on top of the ridge (a common sighting in WV), or a cell phone tower, but I had made that particular drive hundreds of times and felt as if something was unusual, so I dismissed both of those notions.  I woke my girlfriend and asked her if she recognized the object in front of us; she didn't.  The object was vertical, at first, with bright red lights in each corner.  Immediately after waking my girlfriend an extremely bright white light came on in the middle of the object, seemed to make a sweeping motion, and eventually \"highlighted\" us for a brief period of time.  This made both of us nervous, but not particularly scared.  I had to look down at the road and when I looked back up it was floating horizontally above us.  When I looked down at the road again and back up it had disappeared.  The object never seemed to move while I was looking at it, nor did it make any sounds.  I originally thought it was a helicopter but dimissed the notion when I realized it had to have been within 100ft. of us and not making any sound whatsoever.  Both my girlfriend and I were fascinated with the unusual sighting and had thought about calling the regional airport in Clarksburg to see if there were any aircraft in the area at the time.  We never did and never really talked about it the remainder of the time we dated.  I probably wouldn't have really thought about it much more until I watched a UFO special on TV sometime in 2001.  They were discussing a case and had an artist's rendering and animation of the exact same object that I had seen.  Since then I've told the story to some people, always siting what I saw on the television special. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Two Parallel Lights Moving At Very High Speed Along An Unusual Path It was a clear, cold evening in Salem, OR.  The temperature was about 36 degrees, perhaps two degrees above the dew point.  My wife and I were in our spa.  It is situated where two legs of our house (an \u201cL\u201d shape) join such that we have a clear view towards the north and east.  Some trees block a horizon view to the east, and the house blocks the view to the southwest.  There is considerable ambient light.  At 2112 (PST) I noticed two lights moving from the northeast to the southwest.  They were moving parallel to each other, being apart about the same distance as two of the stars in the Big Dipper handle, and half as bright as Mars.  [I think it was Mars I was seeing in the northeast sky.]  I said to my wife, \u201cLook at that!\u201d  They passed right over the top of us, just after which my wife located them.  When they disappeared two seconds later, she said, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d  They moved fast and in straight lines.  About seven seconds elapsed between the times I first saw them above the trees until they disappeared behind my roof.  All I could see were lights, and the lights never varied until they were almost gone.  No noise was heard, although the damned low-speed spa pump was on at the time.  It was too late to see satellites.  Had they been aircraft they would most certainly have been heard (a sonic boom, no doubt).  Since the light was either generated by the objects or reflected, in my mind the only \u201creasonable\u201d explanation is they were birds.  However\u2026  These two \u201cbirds\u201d had to be low (considering their speed) and expert fliers (to perfectly maintain their wide spacing).  They must have had bright underbodies to reflect the light.  City light varies, hence reflection varies, but their brightness didn\u2019t vary.  I sense they weren\u2019t that low, hence the perception of significant speed.",

It was much larger than surrounding stars and visible planets and was much larger than comets I have seen.  It was visible for only a second and then vanished without even leaving a trail.   I have witnessed airplanes and meteor showers, but this object was very large, it appeared to be about a tenth of the size of the moon, and did not continue in a straight path for as long as a falling star or airplane would.

Arriving at the H.S. parking lot around 19:15 I rolled down the windows and opened the sunroof.  Many stars in the sky, just like last night.   Two small planes flew by.  Around 19:45 I saw and heard two jets fly over the H.S., I was amused. The jets flew over the H.S. this evening around the same time the lights were seen last night.  The jets came from the north and flew towards the south.  I could see two red lights overhead.  I felt good, was ready to home, enough of this stuff.  As soon as the jet noise dissipated, I saw a light.  Didn\u2019t believe it would ever happen again.  They were further away, just above the treetops.  Two of the lights were southeast and one was southwest of the H.S.  The lights went on and immediately off.   Two to three seconds duration each time.    They had a yellowish tint, the same as last night.   This went on for several minutes.  Each light went on twice that I noticed.    No trailing lights of any kind.  The lights were bright, almost firework like in color temperature.    Each light illuminated in the same way, they seemed identical. It was weird!  Maybe military exercises were being performed.   I hope this is the case.  The jets \"play\" in the airspace around Salem quite often, but the lights were much lower than the jets. There is probably a simple explanation.

After a while I noticed the \"star\" started moving. I thought my eyes were playing tricks wth me, so I focused on another star. To prove my point the second star didn't move. I turned toward the first star. It was still there but in a different location. I kept looking at it think it might have been a plane, but I don't know of any plane that emits a white light and hovers. So then I thought it was a helicopter. But I know helicopters can't fly that high. Then it moved in a straight line, but it wasn't no usual line. As it was moving it would shuttered. It would dip down and then back up, while keeping it's forward momentum. Then it stopped. During this time I was rushing around to find my video camera, but when I found it I couldn't focus enough on it to get a good picture. I couldn't see anything through the camera, so I put it down. And in the corner of my eye I saw more movement. I turn towards the movement and I noticed two lights moving in a cirrcular motion. They stopped and then one took off going away from me and as it was leaving it would pulse a white light. It would light up and then slowly die out. It repeated this until I lost sight of it. Then I looked at the other one. It did the same thing maybe a minute later. Then I looked back at the first \"star\". It was in the same area but once again it moved in location. Then I saw another light leave from the star I was looking at and I followed that with my eyes. Then I would look at other lights noticing that most of them moved in the way the first one did. I kept watching them, not noticing the almost 2 hours have past. I hated to leave it but I had to go to sleep. But all day today I have been thinking about what I had seen last night.

      "story": "Black triangular shaped aircraft sweeping the ground with a spot light over I-57 near Salem, Illinois. I was on my way home from my fiance\u2019s house on the night of 09/06/06. As I merged into the southbound lane of Interstate 57 from the Salem, IL. on ramp, I noticed that the traffic flow was unusually heavy. This caused me to note the time, which was 20:04 central time. As I checked my speed to set the cruise control I scanned the traffic in the roadway ahead of me. I noticed that both passenger vehicles and tractor-trailers were all moving at the posted limit or in many cases well below it. This in itself is unusual for this stretch of I-57. My first thought was that a State Trooper must have been laying in wait up ahead but as I maneuvered into the left lane to overtake a line of tractor-trailers, I saw 2 green lights probably a couple of hundred feet above the northbound lane and I guess about one quarter mile away. The lights were very bright, they sat side by side and as I watched I noticed that they appeared to be moving in a southerly direction. As I watched I noted that the lights were indeed moving to the south at a slow speed and I was rapidly gaining on them. My next thought was, that it was a police agency employing an aircraft with speed detection equipment. I could by this time see that the lights were part of the same object with one being on each side. This object appeared to me to be moving too slowly to be regular fixed wing and appeared too large to be an ultralite type aircraft so I assumed it to be a helicopter. At that point I decided that I had better be watching the road or \u201cthat chopper\u201d would be life-flighting me to a hospital in St Louis. Just before I came along side the object I got a very intense feeling of dread. It was an almost sick feeling like when you unexpectedly get incredibly terrible news. As I approached, the object was still over the northbound lane, it was slowly moving south, as I could now definitely see it moving past the trees. The traffic in both lanes was still moving but at what appeared to be below the posted limit. I could now see the lig! hts clea rly and they appeared to be running lights on some type of aircraft but I could not determine just what type of aircraft it was.  The sky had been darkening for a while but there was still some natural lighting available as was illumination coming from a rest area that we were approaching. I could make out a dark shape but it was hazy. By this time my view was of course still from behind and the object was at about my 10 o\u2019clock position and I\u2019m guessing about 200 feet above ground. As it came into about my 9 o\u2019clock position, a bright red light appeared to form an equilateral triangle pointing south. At nearly that same instant two other things happened. The sick dreadful feeling in my gut worsened and the aircraft/object stopped in mid air. Immediately the 2 green \u201crunning lights\u201d as I call them, both turned bright red and the object rotated one half turn to the left. It spun itself about, completely 180 degrees in place. It reversed its direction of travel and began moving north very slowly. I slowed my vehicle to a near crawl in the passing lane and watched as the red light that formed the lead corner of the triangle turned a brilliant white. A beam of blindingly white light was projected toward the ground and swept about like a searchlight as the triangle moved northward at a crawl. The beam of light swept back and forth behind a thick copse of trees that line the interstate. I could not see the beam sweeping the ground as whatever it was apparently \u201csearching\u201d for was on the opposite side of the tree line.The entire time I watched the object I looked very closely between the lights to determine just what I was looking at. I could see a triangular outline with length, width and height but could not make out any structural details. It appeared as if it was not completely solid. It was a misty blackish, dark color, darker than the night sky. I could not see through it although again I say it did not look entirely solid. I put my driver\u2019s side window down and stuck my head out as I passed the aircraft,! thinkin g maybe the light factory applied tinting on my vehicle\u2019s glass was interfering with my seeing properly. I heard no sound nor could I see any means of propulsion like props or what might be intake or exhaust ports for a jet. When the object was about 100 feet away to my left and about 200 feet above me I quickly held up my hand to gauge size. The distance between the lights along all 3 sides was a little longer than the length of my left hand. I realized that I was still in the passing lane and I was either going to run over someone or get ran over myself. I felt that I should not stop, the thought of stopping made me nauseous so I changed to the right lane and I watched in my mirrors as the object continued northward, shining its spotlight into the woods with cars passing below it like nothing was wrong. I took my eyes off the mirror and glanced at the road ahead and when I looked back the object was gone. I did not see the object change direction left or right; I did not see it go up or down. I just looked back and it was gone. I turned around in my seat and looked rearward but still did not see anything. By the time I reached Dix, IL. my usual exit, I did not feel like driving the country roads home. I continued on to Mt Vernon at exit 95 and went home on more traveled roadways. I did not sleep well that night thinking about seeing whatever this was. I can\u2019t help but wonder who else saw this. Of all the vehicles on the interstate that night surely I am not the only one that was intrigued enough to look.",

      "story": "Lights moving from south to north, low to ground and slow without any sound. The event happened on January 1st, 2007.  It was an exceptionally dark night; usually there is some minimal light pollution out in all directions from my house, but it seemed much lesser that night in retrospect.  I was doing work as I generally do at that time of night with my window blinds up, as I like to see the sky.  It happened to be a very nice, clear night out without any clouds.  While working away, I noticed out of the corner of my right eye, to the south, something with lights in the sky.  I glanced at it and realized that it wasn't either an airplane or helicopter.  As it was so dark that night, I was unable to make out any shape of the object.  It was emitting absolutely no sound, which is the first thing that struck me as strange.  The object was very low to the ground, far too low for a fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft; by my best estimation, somewhere between 100-150 feet from the ground.  The object had four lights that I could see; two in the front and the other two swept out to the sides and back a bit.  All four of the lights seemed to be emitting a light that looked color-wise to a warm flourescent light, but emitted light as strong and as clear as an industrial bulb would.  I would also like to note that these lights did not seem to shine any light down onto the ground, even from the low altitude.  The object was moving at a quite slow, steady pace, estimated at about 20-30 MPH.  It moved from south to north without stopping, changing course or speed as far as I watched.  Had I been in my senses, I would have jumped up and ran to the front door; I was, however, stunned at what I had just witnessed, wondering if it could have been something ordinary.  I believe it was not, however, due to the facts that a) I saw no landing lights or blinking lights on the craft, and b) There is no landing strip and/or airport north of my house; the nearest one is about three miles south-east.",

As me and my son(13)was coming out of the Wal-Mart in Salem Virginia i looked up in the ski to the far south.  And I then told my son to look at that bright \"light\" in the sky.  We didn't see a shape but it look like one \"headlight\" in the sky traveling backwards.   At first this \"light\" wasn't moving fast.  It actually look like it was just sitting still. Then we looked up a little higher and we saw three jets at first they look like they was just going across but then they starting racing towards the \"light\".  At first I thought they were regular plane but they were too high and moving fast. Then the light\" starting moving south.   As the jets got closer to the \"light\" it stated to move faster.  So I told my son to get in the car because it's going in the direction we are going.  I could barely keep my eyes on the road because i was too busy looking up \"accident waiting to happen\".   As we travel south on 460 to the Elliston area the light started to slight disapear (it look like it was now some where past blacksburg area) then from the southeast we saw another jet or miltary plane moving fast in the same direction as the other 3 jets and the \"Light\".  After that i couldn't see any more because of the mountains.   Whatever it was the i know the military was going after.   If i saw that \"Light' i know others had to see it as well.   I am Christain and i believe in GOD and i don't believe in UFO or anything like that.  But after seeing what me and my son saw today make me think other wise.   I sometimes hear the miliatary planes fly over our area for training purposes but this time they were no-where to heard but only to be seen racing across the sky.",

The moon was spectacular Monday night. While waiting for the moon to rise I caught a glimpse of light out of my right eye.  Initially I thought another street light had come on and didn\u2019t give it a second thought.  However, a few seconds later a second light appeared relatively close to the first light.  The first light disappeared.  A third light appeared close to the second light. When the third light appeared the second light went off.  After the  third light went off they all came on at the same time.  Then itstarted over again.  The lights were on about 15-30 seconds each time. By this time my adrenaline was at it\u2019s all time high.  I became anxious and scared.  I left the parking lot to go get my husband,  by the time we got back, no more lights.  If there is ever a next time, I will stay. The lights came on and off very deliberately.  There was no movement that I could see.  I got outside my car to listen for noise.  There was none.  The lights were very low in the sky and seemed to be very close.  The lights appeared to be over the High School. The  lights  were on the same plane, close together,  but were  not the same distance apart.  The color of the first light is what initially caught my eye.  The lights were very bright, had a yellowish tint and were uniform in shape.  The lights came on quickly and they seemed slow to turn off.  The lights were not the same color as the stars. Fort Leonard Wood is very close to Salem.  There is fighter jet activity over Salem all the time.   I tried to rationalize the lights coming from some sort of aircraft  from Fort Leonard Wood.  This could be the case, but I don\u2019t think so. Never, have I seen anything like this before.  I wish my husband had seen the lights too.  He thinks I am nuts, but I am not.

We were walking back home and talking about going to the back yard to lay down on the trampoline to watch the stars since it was over 61 degrees F...and the sky was clear. As we were walking, I looked towards my house, which is south of my parents house...and I pointed at a bright orange light and said, \"what is that?\". I thought it was a really bright planet or something, but I didn't remember hearing anything about  that...as soon as I had thought that, it disappeared. My son witnessed that as well. As soon as that one had disappeared, another one appeared in the east. Very bright orange-white light. I turned around and told my other niece to run in and tell my parents to come outside and look. I saw it happen in 3 different places about 5 times before I ran inside to grab my camera and drive my car to my parents house. As I got onto their front deck, I saw another one...an! d my brother, Luke, was able to see it just before it faded. He saw another one with me that was a lot dimmer and moved up. My dad, James, came outside and together we saw over 8 occurances in different locations. There were 3-4 times that we saw two lights grouped together. I tried to get a video of the lights, but all it captured was our voices...I will try to find a video editor and see if I can brighten the video. It was very interesting.

We have video of the fourth one, but it is shaky due to the zoom.  The entire event took about 5 minutes. The event occurred during a back yard gathering.  The witnesses (about a dozen) were mostly college professors and school teachers.  The object appeared to be a sphere surrounded by diamond.  Oddly, the sphere is clearly brighter on the back edge of its directions, contrary to what one would expect from atmospheric entry.  This was also the north side of the sphere two hours after sunset and was clear even at the western horizon, ruling out solar reflection. I am not suggesting that this is extraterrestrial, we simply cannot determine what it is.",

      "story": "Cigar Craft, Body Marks and Missing Time   I am not exactly sure when this took place, but I was told it was clear and warm so I suspect it was Spring or Summer and it was in 1949.  This sighting included my parents, my older brother Bob and myself, I was only 2 \u00bd and I do not recall anything.   My dad and mom have different stories, so I will tell this like it was told to me. It was about 9 PM and we had just left my grandmother\u2019s about 5 miles from our home. It is about a 20 minute drive.  Dad had the habit of driving up to S Commercial Street about 2 miles from grandmothers and he and mom  go by and would watch the Color TV in the TV shop before coming home, which they did occasionally and stayed about 15 minutes and then drive home.  This was a very sparsely populated, undeveloped area of town. Dad said, \"The UFO  showed up out of no where and it was cigar shaped, it was silver colored and had red lighted round windows and he could see figures moving around inside but did not see any people.\"  Then, he said if he slowed down, it would slow down and if he sped up, it would also speed up.  It did not make a sound.  He said it paced him on his drive home. That\u2019s where dad\u2019s memory ends. Then mom said, \"No, it was on Market Street NE, this would be between 10-12 miles distance from dad\u2019s sighting, we were heading down Market near Swegle Grade School and Birchwood Drive about 6 blocks from home and all the sudden the UFO appeared and it was near the \"goose house.\"  This was a house where they raised geese and had a very distinctive odor.  I said, \"Did you get out of the car?\"  And she said, \"Yes,\" and dad said, \"No,\" in an almost terrorized voice,  mom said \u201c yes we did and we watched it go over and it almost hit the roof on the goose house. Then mom said she did not recall anything more till they were turning in the driveway at home.  Dad went in and called the local airport and was told that \u201c we are closed \u201c but he talked to the man anyway telling him what happened, and  the agent said they had also seen it and it went over so fast and without a sound and there was nothing around that could track it or follow it. Note: the airport closed at 11 PM, 2 hours after they left grandma's house. It was shortly after that time that I begin to react to low sound and vibration.  My family tells me that I would hear a train go by or vacuum running or even water going down a drain and I would cover my ears and scream. My aunt recalls that I would be playing and then all the sudden become stock still and then slowly turn my head as if I were tracking a sound that only I could hear.  I am not sure what happened that night, but I do know that when I was old enough to recall things, between 6-11 years of age, we would pass a building on the way to my grandmothers and I would sit on the floor of the car,put my back firmly against the locked car door and bite my arm to keep from screaming from pure terror. In later years I went back and looked at the building, still there and it was/is a car parts store with radiator hoses etc\u2026 looking in the windows at night it was dimly lit with curved archways over long dark hallways with lots of dangling tubes hanging down  could this have triggered a memory from that night?  As I said, I do not have any conscious memories of the event Mom has two deep red marks about the size of a small pea about \u00bd\u201d above and below her naval and she has deep dimples from scoop marks on front of both upper thighs and  she has 6 small brown smooth on the skin dots about the size of match heads on her back, forming two separate triangles which one over the other form one diamond and they have been there since that night.  She said the craft almost hit one of the houses as it was so low, it was cigar shaped and had portals and no visible form of engine, fire, etc, but the portals had light behind them. It paced their car, speeding up when he did and slowing down when he did.  We pieced together there was about a 2 hour missing time for this event.  Dad said it was in one area of Salem, and mom saw it in another, about 10+ miles different in location.  Mom said they stopped the car and got out and looked at it, dad said, noticeably scared, NO WE DID NOT and he would not talk about it any more, he died shortly after that. Mom always wondered about this one and still brings it up from time to time. She is now 83  None of her body marks were there before that night. My brother has no recall of that evening at all, he was about 5 years old. He still lives in Oregon as well. Since he has no memory of the incident it did not make much of an impact in his life, as far as we can tell. Dad was about 24 years old. Worked in a cannery as well as sold real estate. dad was always open minded, but I have to say he did not like talking about this event.  Mom was 25 and was home during the day, with my brother and myself to take care of she has always wondered what happened that night and even at her current age of 83 she still has questions and wonders about the marks ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

      "story": "Missing Time July 31, 1997  It happened on July 31, 1997  I had seen something a few days earlier when I was in the backyard and called mom and told her about it, sometime the next morning several others saw the same UFO I did but they made a official report and were talking about it on Art Bell and it made the papers.. I had seen the UFO heading south toward California and it was seen by the others over Medford near the California border, later that same morning. After this sighting when I heard others talking about it on the radio and read about it in the paper, I decided to call Peter Davenport,at the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Peter had been up most all night taking reports with all the sightings in Medford and was very tired and did not have time to take the report, or at least this is what I believe that he said.  I took it personally and thought I would never call Peter again (not Peters\u2019 fault, just my own judgment of the situation. I was helping out a friend in a small store here and told her about it and was still smarting at how Peter had treated me, or I thought he had treated me, and told her about that too. Anyway I was home watching TV, my husband was about to go to bed, he is needs lots of sleep.. he reminded me to lock the back door and put the stick in it.. that way if the cats get ancy we can open the patio door, put a stick in it and let them go in and out at will... anyway I said I would, and did, and he went to bed and I lay down on the couch and was out like a light, fully dressed/shoes too The next thing I remember was waking up and seeing it was time to feed the cats, it was about 7AM.. my husband was in his computer room and the back door was open, the stick had been removed, I got up, fed cats and my husband and was relaxing watching TV news with my second cup of coffee, when the phone rang and it was <former boss>, she was calling me to see if I was alright, and to ask me about the lights, I said you mean the ones I saw the other night? She said NO the ones you saw this morning.. I said I did not see any lights this morning and she said Yes you did, she again said are you OK?   I said YES I was fine, why wouldn't I be.. she said after your call this morning about the lights, I said what call, she said the one you made to me early this morning, she said you left me a message.. I wanted to hear it but she had erased it not thinking about it, but had listened to the message numerous times and had written it down verbatim' and signed the paper.. this is what she said the message said... (my remarks)  <name>, this is CK, I'm really sorry to call you at this time, it is 2:40 AM, in the morning, I am out by North Salem High School ( this is about 3 miles from my home) and I have been watching a bright light in the sky for about 45 minutes. If you know Peter Davenports number or one who does that sort of thing down here (In Salem) they need to be called. I am looking south and a little east and the large light is very bright, too big to be a star. There are 3 smaller lights in a line down one side and I can see two in a line down the other side, but there may be a third one, I can't see from here. It hasn't moved. If you know who investigates these please call them and tell them the information because there is no way this is stars.. End of recording/message.. I told <name> that she was kidding, right? she said \"No I swear its true\"  I asked her where I called from, she said she did not know, but that when I was done I did not say goodbye or anything, the line just went totally blank/dead, and it had a empty tinny sound. I called my husband into the living room and asked him when he took the stick out of the patio door? He said I thought you did, the door was open when I got up about 6:00 AM.. I ran to the front door, and it was closed but unlocked, it had been locked and a separate latch used, that was also open.. then I went into the driveway, scared of what I would find, and there was my car, parked on the opposite side of the driveway than I usually park.. I was terrified.. Where had I been, what had I done?  I asked my husband did you get up to go to the bathroom last night? He is usually up 2-3 times a night, NO he said for some reason he had not awakened till just before he got up.. I grabbed my purse and drove over to the high school, I got out of the car near the football field and walked over to the fence surrounding the field, trying to remember what I might have seen, did anything trigger a memory, and all that happened was that I got very dizzy, but walked around looking for some clue as to what had happened.. I remember looking for a tan shingled roof I had been standing near and wanted to check that out on the letter from <name>and was very surprised to see she/I had not mentioned any such roof or color of shingles in the message so it must have been a memory of the event..the only one I have had of that night. I am fortunate to know a lot of UFO researchers and I immediately called my old friend Dr Leo Sprinkle who works with abductees, some researchers or psychologists make the event scary, but if Dr Sprinkle does the same interview the abduction becomes a positive experience not a negative one, a learning experience. I was terrified about what could have happened... what if I would have had a car accident? a flat tire? How would I explain being out driving alone at 2:40 AM?   Dr Sprinkle pointed out that I was likely totally alert and in control till I got home and that is when they took remove any  memory of what happened.. This still haunts me and I still check the doors several times during the evening hours to be sure they are locked. For over a year I had slept fully dressed in a sweat suit complete with shoes etc. Note: Peter is always open and willing to listen to urgent reports. I just took his being tired personally and that was my problem, not Peters\u2019 short coming.  CK 7/31/97",

      "story": "EXPLOSION OF CRAFT 1998 It was May 30th, 1998,  9 PM Sunday night.  Had just finished watching  \u201cTouched By An Angel \u201c It was warm and a soft breeze had been blowing.  It was twilight, not light, but not dark, the stores had just closed and people were still out, most likely heading home. One of my cats, \"Patches,\" now deceased,  was acting strangely and wanted out, so I went to the door and followed her out and glanced at the sky in front of the house. Then I saw it.. a large craft kind of oval in shape, about the size of a car, could not make out the shape, it was diffused light, off in the distance, moving very slowly and seemingly very low altitude towards me.  My husband came out to see what I was looking at and I pulled him down the sidewalk, away from the artificial lights of the house, we were standing by the edge of the house, near the garage. We both noticed that the light in the craft was golden in color, and was flickering like a candle.  All the sudden, the entire craft, ship, blew up, I screamed. Pieces of it blew up, down, and sideways, we could watch the metal burning, and dripping, as I watched the pieces fall, still burning to below the tree line and out of sight. There was no sound.. I ran for the phone and called 911 and reported a \u201c plane \u201c might have blown up.  Then I heard sirens and said \u2018 Oh someone already had reported this to you? The 911 operator said  \u201c No, it was an accident on the bridge, \u201c I said, they probably saw what we did and ran into the wall of the bridge.  So I did report the explosion. Then I called our local airport tower, and no planes were reported in trouble.  I called the military in Portland Oregon because they have a helicopter wing NG in Salem , again no planes or choppers missing or in trouble.  I called PDX and reported it to the tower in Portland , and  then I called SeaTac in Seattle area and again reported the incident. Nothing, but they did take my name in case something or someone ended up not arriving at their destination. I even called Evergreen Helicopters which is located about 28 miles from Salem and again, nothing was reported out of the ordinary. Early the 2nd day / morning sometime after midnight, I was so frustrated that I decided to take a chance and called for the number of Cheyenne Mountain in CO.NORAD might be able to tell me something I called and was very fortunate to have a Air Force man take the call, and explained my reason for the call and he promised to look into it and call me back, I thought I would not hear from him again.  I said, \"it could be a asteroid or something\", but I really needed to know what it was I saw.  So as promised, he called back several hours later. He said \u201c according to their reports/records, nothing man made entered the Earth's  atmosphere at that time.\u201d I said \u201c You mean it was a asteroid or something ? \u201c He said \u201c You are not listening to me,  NOTHING MAN MADE and he accented the words MAN MADE,  ENTERED THE EARTHS ATMOSPHERE AT THE TIME OF YOUR SIGHTING.\u201d Then it dawned on me he was telling me what I needed to know.  He asked if there was anything further he could do, I said no and thanked him and we hung up.  What was this sighting.. Was it a small craft? Did it blow up or was it shot down?  We watched the molten metal falling, where was it from?   Why didn\u2019t we hear anything?  It seemed a few mere miles away.. how far away was it?  Why didn\u2019t someone else report this?  5/30/1998",

I would lay down on the picnic table on the patio with a tube pillow under my head,(to keep from getting a kink in my neck) and binoculars on my chest.. I was watching the local ABC 11 o'clock news, my husband was already asleep, having gone to bed several hours before, (his illness forces him to get a-lot of sleep) anyway I know I looked at the clock at 11:15 PM when I opened the patio glass sliding doors and went outside... I laid on the table for what seemed like about 10 minutes, checking out the stars and planets etc, and then I got up and walked around the patio to get a different perspective of the sky.. all the sudden I looked down the back side of the house (NE SIDE) back of house was facing North, and said out-loud but to myself, \"I need to go make sure my bedroom window is closed it might rain\", keep in mind this was August our hottest month of the year, and there was not a chance in Hell of getting any rain.. I came into the house and walked down the hall to my bedroom, to go in and check the windows, the door to the room was almost closed so I reached for the door handle to push it open and the door SLAMMED in my face with a loud noise, I thought \" it was a draft from the open window\" I put my hand on the door to open it and could not turn the knob, I pushed against it, and pulled on it, yelled at it and kicked it, the door was locked, then I remembered that we do not have any room locks on the bedroom doors.... I remember yelling for my husband who is a light sleeper to come and help me, nothing... then I called him again, again nothing so finally I walked away from the door across the hall and went in and bodily shook him awake and he seemed that he was drugged I explained to him what was happening and finally got up and he too tried to open the bedroom door, pulling and pushing.. finally it opened..and one of the cats slipped into the room and came running out growling with a full bottlebrush tail, I went into the room and I felt a bit of vertigo but that\u2019s all... I looked at my bedroom clock and it was 2:15 AM, it had been over 3 hours since I went outside, but it seemed like only about 20-30 minutes. I checked the window and it was closed (no surprise) and then I noticed there was a box on the floor, it had been sitting under the window on the window-seat and it was about 1-2 feet away from the window-seat upside down on the floor, but the contents were not on the floor, nothing was spilled, I am not sure how that was done.. (all that was in the box was ET reports and information)  Finally I got the cats calmed down, husband went back to bed and I shut and locked the patio doors and laid down on the couch, I was barely dozing when my husband yelled from the bedroom... I ran in to see what was the problem and he said \"Something is touching me\", I asked him what it was, cats were not in the room, he said \"I don't know but I could hear a buzzing sound and when I closed my eyes I could see blue and red lights moving around the room through the crack in my eyes. He said they were not totally closed. He also said \"I could not move\" I said \"Why didn't you open your eyes?\" and I think he thought I had lost my mind, he said he did not want to see them,he lay back down and about 10 minutes later he was in the living room standing by the couch.. I said \" what do you want?\" he said \" I do not want to sleep in there tonight, they keep coming back and touching me\"  The next morning except for the episode with the door he didn't seem to remember any of the happenings.. he had multiple small scoop ( bb size) marks on his arms. On several occasions my husband as I said who is a light sleeper did not respond to my calls for help or assistance, and he did not get up in the night and find me missing when I was not there..  I personally believe that is the intention of the Et's to keep him sleeping when they are busy with me.

      "story": "Vague chevron object with strange colored lights and erratic movement seen, with smaller lights/objects emitted from it as it traveled. I was looking up at the stars, which I could see clearly (this tends to be unusual with our normally cloudy skies), and I suddenly saw a bright starlike light (white with reddish around edges)which faded quickly as it moved slow about 2 inches toward the north. I thought this was a shooting star or something. Then another bright starlike light shone to just the east of it, but this one started shooting around wildly like a binball machine, erratic and quickly with no discernable pattern and at extreme angles, but completely unlike a plane possibly could, within about a 5 in radius (from my perspective). Then this light headed southward at a more steady pace, and as it went I could see several lights blinking quickly in different colors - red, white, blue, green - but these lights blinked randomly and all around a two inch-long object that I could just vaguely see (It seemed very high up). At one point they almost seemed to light up rapidly in a 'band' across the width of the object. It looked slightly grey against the deep blue sky, and it appeared to have an elongated point at it's head and possibly two shorter points at its end with a concave bottom - possibly chevron shaped (it may have had more points to it, but it was very unclear). All the blinking lights were no bigger than most of the stars around the sky. As it headed south overhead it traveled about the speed of a plane way high up, but it kept blinking these colored lights in a random effect all over the face of it. Then smaller white lights began shooting away from it one & two at a time in all directions, going away up to about 5-6 inches. It still had a main white light, brighter than the rest, which continued to blink at erratic but consistent intervals. We watched it do this until it was very far south, to the distant tree line. Small lights continually came off from it, although they were very hard to see once it had reached that far away. About 10 minutes later, the lights of what looked to be a regular airplane, with one white light & one red flashing at regular & consistent intervals, crossed the sky in the same path and disappeared at the same point beyond the trees.",

I was inside sitting on the sofa talking to a family member.  My attention was drawn to the window and the \"star.\"  I asked my cousin to look at the \"star\" because it seemed to be changing colors.  We both agreed that it was changing color from white to red and then to blue.  We then grabbed two other family members and a couple pairs of binoculars and went out onto the front porch.  Through the binoculars we could see the light changing colors in an almost fibre optic style.  The light hovered slightly above the tree line for about 35 minutes. At times it seemed to fade and then become stronger.  After about 35 minutes it began to dip down into the tree line.  After that, it just disappeared. Very unusual.

This sighting is one of the most unnerving experiences my wife and I have ever had.  I was a private pilot fo 14 years and never saw any image such as we saw that evening when I did night flying.  The dual objects appeared to be at 35 degrees off horizon.  At first I thought it was one object, probably a plane but if that were the case it why did it have orange balls on its wing tips instead of the traditional green and red wing lighting?   The object was approaching us heading southbound and we were facing true north. Intially it appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, 4-5 miles from us.  I cannot estimate the altitude but I'm guessing 3000-5000 feet.After 30 seconds of from first spotting, what I thought was one object turned out to be two.  One orange ball on our right started to lose altitude and converge toward the other orange glowing ball.  It  the turned sharply to our right away from the other ball and disappeared. Just prior to doing this it appeared to us that both orange objects appeared to stop in mid air.  About 10-15 seconds after the first disappearance, the remaining orange ball vanished.  I would say our entire viewing was 1-1/2 minutes. Upon returning to our home in about 5 minutes I called our local Salem Ohio police department and recounted this experience to them. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and sincere.  PD))",

I was only able to see it for a few seconds before it went behind a tree line.  The sun reflecting off of it burnt the retina of my eyes from being so reflective.  Someone else I know has seen it on two separate occasions, where when they saw it during the night time it flew past some trees and the next day when they went back to the same location the trees were burnt around where it was at.  Attempts that she made to take pictures of it resulted in all the film in her camera being totally ruined as if it'd been burnt.  She reported that during the night time it has red and blue lights which I think at another time years before the time I witnessed it in this account, I saw it as well but at night judging by the way she described it.

Two times it looked to be on fire and thrusting towards salem.   When I saw them for the third time, it was like a big object in the sky on fire.   At one point the fire ball seemed to be half the size of the moon.  It was huge.   I lost sight of the object when we turned right on Hwy 72 towards Rolla, and the Fireball was presumed to go the other direction.

I was standing next to my house, looking up at the sky, observing the chemtrails which I do often. It wasn't a heavy chemtrail day, just a couple of Xes and lines that were spreading out. Suddenly I noticed something moving quickly past the trails. My eyes focused on what I first thought was a flock of birds in the far distance. It looked like bunch of dots in a formation. I'm wasn't sure how many, maybe ten or twelve, because this formation of dots was moving very fast. When I noticed them, they were directly in front of me, but within 2 to 3 seconds they had traveled across the sky to my left until they vanished in the distance. I stood there a few minutes thinking about what I just saw, wondering what it could have been. If it wasn't for the speed, it could have been a flock of birds so far away that they looked like dots. Then I thought it could have been a group of insects that were quite close to me streaking by and staying in a perfect formation. Maybe a squadron of jet fighters? But there was no noise made by this UFO. I thought it couldn't have been any of these things because it was just moving to fast. I didn't think much more about my sighting until last night when I saw the photo of the London sighting. It appears to be the same kind of formation only closer to the viewer. Could it be that there's a UFO squadron speeding around globe? I think it's a possibility.  I have a degree in Nursing and have worked in the manufacturing field.

All the sudden I saw what looked like a bright light about 1000-2000 feet above me. I had not seen where it came from.  After a minute it was joined by 2 more bright objects. I tried to look at them to see if they were gulls, or something else.  They did not move in the pattern a gull would.  I also thought about balloons, but again they do not move the way these did, no floating etc, these moved in deliberate movement. First 1 light, then being joined by another and just sitting still, no movement. After a couple of minutes of watching the 3 bright lights, all the sudden there were at least 13-15 or more of the objects. Then they began to form triangles some were standard all the same length triangles an then some were much longer and the end lights were closer together forming an elongated triangle.  I watched them come together, move apart, form patterns of triangles and then just move back and sit there. There was one light, and then it was being joined by another and just sitting still, no movement. Then they began moving to form triangles and groups of 3-7 objects in a circle pattern. I was getting ready to go back to work and one of the managers of the place I work came by, I asked him if he could see anything, he said \u201c no \u201c and I said come over to where I am standing, and he did and then he said \u201c Yes I can see something \u201c I said \u201c What is it?\u201d and he said \u201c its not planes, and it\u2019s not birds and I don\u2019t know what they are, but if I had a gun, I would shoot at them\u201d  Just what I needed a trigger happy witness.  So that was when they disappeared. I have a Canon 12x SX 200 IS camera and I did take a couple of pictures but the sun was so bright and it was hard to see anything through the lens.  I have been trying to see if I can find some photo enhancing software to look at the pictures. There is obviously something there in the pictures. So when the objects disappeared, I made a note of the time and went back to work. I did not hear of anyone else seeing them and I did not see them later when I went outside.

All other games at the park were over and all the lights were off but his game in progress.  I was sitting in my car in the parking lot when I happened to look up and to the left.  There was a huge bright glowing light just about 1,000 feet about the trees.  I was shocked, there was no sound at all and the light was so bright you could not look straight had it. After watching it for about thirty minutes I could see red lights around it.  It would float across the sky. It stayed there the whole 3 hours I was in the parking lot.    When the game was over, I thought great somebody will see the object but as soon as the game ended,the object floated off west of me.  I watched the object for 2 and half to 3 hours.

      "story": "Triangular-shaped object hovers 30 to40 feet above car for five minutes. To the investigators of UFO\u2019s On November 10, 1991 my cousin and I were subject to an object that not only crossed our paths that night, but would affect both of our way of thinking for some years to come. It was 10:15 P.M.  Central Standard Time as we were traveling east on highway H and was coming back into the town of Salem, Missouri. We had just crossed the one- lane bridge that resides approximately 5 miles out of town on H highway, and made our way up and over the hill just \u00bc of a mile past DD intersection. Upon topping over the hill, my cousin notices what he believes is an airplane to our far left in the cattle ranchers\u2019 field and this object is traveling south. Upon further notice, we both realized that not only was this airplane descending, but it made absolutely NO SOUND as it made its way across the field and toward H highway in which we were traveling on. Believing that it was an airplane, we accelerated to approximately 90 miles per hour so as to pass under the plane as it crossed the highw! ay.  The object reached H highway before our car had the chance to pass under it or even get close to it, and much to our dismay the object came to a complete stop above H highway. As our car came to a screeching halt, it slid up under the object and stalled out. Sitting in the middle of the highway, my cousin and I stared up at the object, still believing that it was some sort of a helicopter, when we both noticed that the object was making no sound, it was not moving, and the unknown object hovered silently not 30 to 40 feet above us. In fear, my cousin rolled up his window and we sat silently staring up at the craft. Jerry turned to me and asked \u201cwhat do you think it is?\u201d To which by this time I realized that neither of us knew the answer to his question. The object had three lights on its underside that were extremely bright. These lights formed a triangular shape and the light source did not waver in energy, in fact, the lights were so bright that the whole highway was ! illuminated as though it was daytime. After sitting motionless! above t he highway for what I believe was approximately two minutes, the craft began to slowly move diagonal from its original route and hovered to a clearing in the open field that lay to the right of my car. The object hovered just above the tree tops, almost brushing them as it passed over them, until it had reached an opening in the field. The object stops again and then, much to our dismay, starts to turn onto its side and then slowly lower itself to the ground. So close to the ground in fact, that I could see the silhouette of the field grass as the light from the two back lights shined through them. After sitting at ground level for no longer than one minute, the object slowly left our side and made its way down the forest that rested to its immediate right. The object then leveled back out flat to the ground as it traveled and after flying about 300 yards, it ascended at a 30 degree angle. It flew up into the night sky, never to be seen again by my cousin or myself. After mu! ch deliberation, my cousin and I agreed that we had not experienced any lost time nor have we ever found any explanation for what we witnessed.",

      "story": "We walked out side during supper, woke up standing in the back yard, then I saw 5 of them  watching me. My UFO encounter happened in South Jersey (&quot;1956&quot;) when I was in second grade. It was dark outside, I was about 8 years old, we just started a late supper when dad said; &quot;What's that funny noise?&quot; Mom was standing next to the kitchen table dishing out food, we cut a look at each other in disbelief (cause dad's hearing was never good) how did he hear something we didn't?   Dad enthusiastically said; &quot;Come on, let's go outside. Let's see what it is. Not me, I was hungry & kept eating.  Dad rushed back in the to get me, saying; &quot;come on, come on, come on, you don't want to miss this!&quot;  Reluctantly, I got up (& for some unknown reason) turned directly around to note the exact time ... 8:32 PM on a school house clock. (Dad continued to coax me outside.)   When I got outside dad was pointing to this dark spot in the night sky, it was terribly overcast with just a few stars here & there. Dad had put the yard light on (making it difficult to see) I couldn't make out a shape, just a darker spot in the sky.  He pointed saying; &quot;Look at the funny lights! See-em? See-em, right there.&quot; I was looking but I didn't see any funny lights, just a very dark spot. I decided to walk further away from the yard light. Mom & dad walked a few steps away too. I was about 25' to 30' further down the yard than them when I decided I was going to concentrate (with all my might) to make out a shape. Boom, that was it, the next thing I knew, I was waking up. Mom & dad were asleep standing the yard with their mouths open, & that's when I realized my legs were aching like I ran a marathon. I looked in the direction they were looking but it wasn't were, it seemed to be further away, slightly higher, and left. (All three of us were in slightly different positions than we were.)   I cleared my throat out loud and sheepishly said; &quot;Ah, dad ... dad?&quot; he woke up as my mom did a second later, they both put their heads down & walked directly in the house. I said; &quot;There it is right there! Look!&quot; they paid no attention. The next thing I knew, that thing was much lower, easier to see, I walked under a tree, & closer to get a better view. More than anything, I was extremely angry, I could now see the UFO with 5 of them staring at me. (About 150' away, it was no more that 25' off the ground at this point.) (They had rounder bald heads than the grays, the best I can tell, there was like a hazy fog around their ship.)  I remember thinking ... you lousy bastards, you mess with us, then sit there watching what we do? Thinking about that P.O.ed me even more!  I found a rock and threw it at them, I looked for another but only found a dirt clod so I threw that feeling I showed them how I felt about them. (Although they didn't physically react, I did get a minor feeling they were somewhat surprised I did that.) I turned then stomped in the house. I heard dad walking up the stairs, while mom keep repeating; &quot;Would you look at the time? What happened to the time? Where'd the time go?&quot; (About 3 times over.) Don't know if I would have noticed if she hadn't pointed it out. Shocked, it was now 9:40 (an hour & eight minutes later in time). Mom suddenly declared; &quot;I'm going to bed right now!&quot; With me still staring at the clock, & with a burst of determination she quickly went around behind me and shot upstairs. (???)  My mom, as long as I knew her Never Ever went to bed before 12. I was dumbfounded knowing that ... I had lots of questions, I tried processing the events but could not figure out how this happened, it made no sense. (With no answers, I remember thinking, I'll have to figure it out later, and went to bed.)  The next morning food & dishes were still on the kitchen table, mom was having a fit, shoving a dish right in my face saying; &quot;Nobody finished supper, we left the food on the table all night, I cooked supper for nothing ... &quot; & etc. I went to school that day, waiting until supper (to kind of re-create the moment) when I questioned them both. They completely ignored me at first, I mean I had one heck of a time getting their attention. I asked dad again & again; &quot;Dad, remember you said you heard those funny sounds last night?&quot; after 3 times he finally turned with the most blurry, blood shot, dead eyes, and said; &quot;Uh-huh.&quot; I said; &quot;Dad, dad remember you saw those funny lights?&quot; I repeated it over & over until he turned to me again & said; &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;  That's it?  I turned to my mom saying; Remember when you said; &quot;Look at the time? What happened to the time? Where'd the time go?&quot; I repeated it several times until she finally turned to me with bleary, welled up, blood shot eyes, and said; &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;  Nothing! Ahhhhh!!!  Mom & dad started talking about something else, and me, I put my head down realizing they didn't remember anything, they were no help at all. I thought, here's my father one of the most brilliant & talented people I know he was a pilot, an inventor, RCA copied the long range TV antenna after his model, he was smarter than any of my teachers. He had an amazing memory, quoted Shakespeare, could add a full shopping cart of groceries before the checker could finish punching in the prices, he had ESP & could read minds, telling me (word for word) what someone was going to say before they said a thing, he told me my future (things that were 40 years out) & yet, he didn't have chance against them, he can't remember anything, they're more powerful than he is. I felt very alone & with no one to protect me from those rotten bastards.  I felt hopeless thinking ... what chance do I have?  In third grade, I was home (by myself) when I saw a UFO account on broadcast TV (it involved story after story about crashed military aircraft, including a passenger airliner that had supposedly been downed by UFO craft in the &quot;1950's&quot;. (I was amazed) it showed UFO's darting a crossed a clear blue sky, & told how the military had made a decision to not attempt to shoot at them because of too many lost lives & equipment losses. After watching that film I was excited & asked just about everybody. I told my parents, believing I'd soon have answers & find the real truth ... sorry to say, that was it, no one I knew saw it, & nothing ever became of it. (I've looked on line to find that same broadcast ... but nothing except for a tiny segment you can see on a Disney broadcast.) &quot;Disney UFO Documentary: 'Alien Encounters'&quot;  In sixth grade my class had the most wonderful teacher, Mrs. Mixner (we all loved her) one day she asked if anyone had seen a UFO. Feeling brave I raised my hand & told her & the class the whole story, it was the first time I opened up about what happened. Classmate, Mary Anne Catalano volunteered that she & her parents had seen a strange light in the sky (I was hoping for more) Mrs. Mixner asked her several questions, but she didn't remember anything else, that was it? (Ahhh ... !!!)  As teen, and as an adult, I would sometimes bring the subject up to dad ... he would just freeze up. I do remember a few times when he'd say; &quot;You know there are UFO's and E.T.s out there, anybody who believes we're the only species in this universe is stupid!&quot; I would always say, yes dad, I KNOW we're not the only ones. Through the years I read whatever I could find on the subject, told my friends, coworkers, two wives, & my kids, but I never had anyone tell me of any experiences. It always ends the same way, no one ever makes a comment after I tell my story. One of the last times I talked to my dad (he called from Florida) he was especially up beat & cheerful telling me all the stuff he was doing, fishing, the green house he made, & so I decided to slip in our UFO incident. Oh man ... I've felt horrible for doing that ever since. I waited. He didn't say Uh-huh that day ... it was just this very long pause (dad was always worried about the phone bill & with him not saying anything it was highly unusual) finally I asked if he was still there, he said; &quot;Yes.&quot; I only talked to him one more time after that, I killed his spirit of joy, and that call ended abruptly. Dad died in &quot;1991&quot;  I decided to move to Florida staying with my mom for a little while.  I told her the whole UFO story, carefully detailing every part, what everybody said, & what my thoughts were, just hoping she'd remember or say something helpful. Mom didn't say a word during the story, she just listened. (I seriously doubted she would even respond after all those years of nothing.) Big surprise (as soon as I finished) mom immediately shocked me by going into a story about the time she was pregnant when I was little. She said; &quot;You probably don't remember this ... &quot;  I said; &quot;Oh yes do (I recounted) I remember the day dad asked if I wanted a little brother or a sister. I was standing by the grape arbor eating grapes when he came out and asked me, he had this bounce in his step, filled with joy, and as happy as I'd ever see him.&quot; Then Mom said; &quot;You know, your dad could never figure it out what happened ... it just went away.&quot;  Ohhhhh ... noooo, alarm bells went off with my knowing about that hybrid program the E.T. were doing, ahhhhh!  Could I have a 1/2 alien brother or sister out there ... ??? ... oh no!  Okay, occasionally a fetus can be absorbed back into the mother's body, but under the circumstances, considering the time line being so close to that same time (I have NO proof) but I do have some serious concerns as to what could have happened. Mom died in 2005 and I must say I'm grateful for having had the opportunity to relate that story to her, and more than a little spooked to learn what she had to say in return. I'm still searching for answers \u2026",

      "story": "5 orange glowing objects cruise by swimming pool in densely populated neighborhood of NE Salem. At 10:30 PM Sunday evening the 12th of August my wife ((name deleted)) (48 yrs old) and myself (49)were in the 16 foot illuminated (underwater light) pool surrounded by darkness and stars in the back yard for a half hour or so when I noticed a glowing round orange object flying north to south just west of our property, less than quarter mile away at about 500 feet up (fairly low altitude in the densely populated neighborhood we live in North East Salem).   5 minutes later, from the north, 5 orange balls of silent traveling light could be seen traversing over the neighborhood between my street (Siesta) and the street to the west of ours (Bonanza) at about 20 to 30 miles per hour, traveling against a 5 to 10 mile per hour wind and rapidly approaching the airspace directly across from our pool.  During the approach my wife suddenly came to the realization this was not conventional aircraft, got spooked and insisted I get my glasses as she quickly got out of the pool.  I d! ashed to the kitchen door and retrieved by glasses and ran back to the edge of the pool, propping my arms up on the wood pile that lined the property line.  My wife was now standing behind me watching as the objects now slowly cruised by together, reminiscent Japanese lanterns but at a close enough vantage point to eliminate that possibility.  They also were clearly traveling together and independent of the wind so I quickly dismissed the possibility of such a man-made object.  The glowing balls of orange light, less than a quarter mile away and at about 500 feet briefly continued away from the pool to the left and each orange ball, one by one, imploded on itself disappearing one by one till all has disappeared from the sky. A couple of observations. I have been a student of the UFO phenomenon for over 25 years, spending the late 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s as a field investigator and assistant state director for MUFON and eventually helping establish Oregon UFO Research in 2000.  At the time of this event, the wife and I HAD JUST been discussing the subject of unidentified flying objects, and in particular I was in the middle of telling her about an incident in 1988 when I saw a low flying orange ball of light in my back yard in West Salem.  Almost immediately on the heels of telling her that story these balls of light appeared coming in over the homes along our street and heading our way and looking exactly like the object I had seen 23 years before.   I caught myself saying, \"You gotta be kidding me,\"  to my wife in light of just recalling to her the incident 23 years before. My gut feeling as I watched the orange glowing orbs or balls was that the flight was intentional, that they slowed as they passed us next to the pool and that we were being watched as we watched them, strong feeling.

But as we moved further south the thing quickly appear to both of us as a small hang glider or experimental aircraft.  My wife thought she saw the operator underneath but that was when the UFO made a deliberate left bank and from about 30-50 feet up in the sky, crossed over the top of the North bound freeway lanes to the Southbound lanes and came right towards us (and everyone behind us in heavy traffic).  It was then we both got an incredible close-up view of this thing as follows: only about 4 feet in length, and about two feet across, dark dull gray in color with kind of like a tear drop shape, the rear being much smaller than the front.  There was something hanging just under the body, like a camera mount but no markings on the craft.  I was stunned at the proximity to us and failed to turn on my camera phone function.  It was traveling about 50 mph\u2026I say this because the speed limit was 70 in that area and it was coming from the North bound side of freeway but wasn\u2019t quite a! s fast as the traffic.  Since my wife was driving, I turned in my seat and watched it fly right over a semi-tractor and make controlled right and then left banking, then into a completely straight path.  At that point my wife said, \u201c what the hell was that? \u201c I told her I think it\u2019s some kind of new surveillance machine the state patrol was using, because I\u2019d read that there are new technologies emerging for military and police applications, that this might be one of them.  I called my son in Nevada and asked him to look these things up on the computer.  He said there were some discussions abut a year ago that the Oregon department of agriculture was thinking about using drones.  Later that night, I got on the Internet myself and looked it up, only to find a ridiculous looking octopus shaped device with eight little helicopter blades which would be Oregon's drone.  What a laugh!  What we saw was actually sleek, quick and beautiful in a weird sort of way.  There was no visible means! of propulsion at all and as I said, no markings.  Please, I would love to have someone reading this correct me and tell me that what we saw can be easily explained.",

Then as I reached in my pocket for the car keys something caught my attention, at first I thought it might be a shooting star, but then I quickly realized from the shapes and movements that they had to be something else.  I watched two dome shaped yellowish-white lights move across the sky in a north east direction, each moving back and forth but continuing forward.  The lights did not blink like an airplane's or were small and bright like the rescue helicopters that fly to the hospital nearby, the lights were constant yet large and dim, pointing straight down.  I wasn't able to see if their was any other shapes that they might have been ommitting from, my only assumption is that they were two separate units flying together.  I was initial shocked to look up and see such a thing happenin! g right here in my home town.  What solidifies my conclusion that they definitely UFO's, is that for the low altitute, roughly 150ft above the ground, their was absolutely no sound at all.

It was a clear, cloudless, starry night perfect for observing the night sky.   We went out front to the driveway which is facing south, and began looking at the stars when my husband noticed a small bluish-white star-like light moving slowly and noiselessly SE.  He alerted me to it and my mind automatically thought \u201cit\u2019s a plane,\u201d but also that it was strange that it was flying so low, close to the dark outline of treetops behind the neighbor\u2019s field.   It moved behind a tall tree and we couldn\u2019t see it anymore, so we moved a small distance west up the street to try and see it but still was not able, so we walked east back down the street.  It slowly came out to a clearing to the west of the tall tree making short, jumpy movements, like stop, go, stop, go, heading towards another outline of clustered trees.   It, still moving west, went behind those trees where we could not see, so again, we moved west trying to follow and a few seconds later, it flashed a bluish-white light through the trees at us and started moving back eastward past the trees and over the clearing (by this time we were running back east to follow it) toward the tall tree again, still making short, jumpy movements.   It went behind the tall tree again (we are now facing the tall tree) and that\u2019s when I saw it flash its bluish-white light even brighter (almost flashlight-like) right through the tree at us!  It moved east of the tree slowly, staying really low to the treetops of the line of trees next to it.  It stopped suddenly and hovered for a few seconds right over the treetops.  Then, all of a sudden I see it drop straight downward below the treetops where I could not see.  It disappeared for what seemed like a few minuets but every once in a while, I could see the bluish-white light peeking up around and through the treetops almost as if it was trying to play \u201cpeek-a-boo\u201d with my husband and I, moving left a! nd right , up to the treetops and back down again, in a slow fashion.  As it was doing this, I also noticed a small red light on the object\u2019s left/east side that would sporadically blink, not in any fashion similar to our commercial aircraft.  It then rose straight up over the treetops and began to change shape and colors changing from its original bluish-white light to blue to red and back to bluish-white light, its little left/east side red light flashing, it moved up, down, east, west in such unpredictable movements, going back westward toward the tall tree.  It went behind the tall tree still changing color and shape and came out to the west of it into the clearing, and right next to the west of the tree made a diamond-like shape pattern going east, down, west, up, and back to its eastern starting point slowly turning into a big yellow-golden glowing triangular shaped star-like light object that slowly moved into the middle of the clearing growing bigger and brighter, hovering there right in front of us.  While hovering, we got to better observe the object.  Overall, it had a yellow-gold light.  The shape of the object was triangular (point up) with a glowing golden light in the center.  There were three golden triangular shaped lights shining from the two sides and bottom of the object.  On the left/east side of the object, right underneath the glowing light, was the erratically flashing red light I saw from earlier. But its shape and size changed also.  This time I saw that it had a big red light and right underneath that light was a smaller red light.  Hovering there in the clearing, it glowed big and bright and constantly flashed its red lights at us.  We were directly in front of it.   After hovering in the clearing for what seemed like minutes upon minuets, the object slightly turned facing its red lights right at us, and started moving westward again at a leisurely pace toward a large tree that it disappeared behind.   My husband and I ran westward back up! the street to see if we could see it again, but it was gone.  It was 1 0:05pm (22:05) when the object left, making the duration of our experience around 15 minuets total. The whole time my husband and I were exclaiming things like \u201cWhoa!?!\u201d, \u201cWhat?!?\u201d, \u201cWow!?!\u201d, \u201cOh my gosh!?!\u201d when it was star-like and making unpredictable movements and changing colors and speeds.   After it changed its shape and color to a triangular golden light object we still were exclaiming as described above, but then I heard my husband say (almost in a trance-like but still fully aware state) \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d to which I responded in a similar fashion \u201cIt\u2019s angelic\u201d.  But when I heard my husband say that and after I responded to him, a feeling of emptiness and despair came over me.  I felt like the object was something malicious trying to trick our minds.  My husband seemed to experience a bodily reaction at the time of the sighting.  He started shaking and breathing heavily and exclaiming.  I was in such bewilderment and shock at what I was seeing (trying to keep myself together), but it was most definitely like NOTHING I have EVER seen in the sky before and it was UNMISTAKABLY, UNDOUBTEDLY, something that is not of this world.

      "story": "Brilliant star-like object hovers above trees and shines bright lights before changing into golden triangle. On the night of October 4, 2013 around 9:50pm, my wife and I decided to go look at the stars. We were in front of my parents house in Salem, Oregon facing south.  The sky was very clear that night and, after a minute or two I spotted something that at first I thought might have been a far off plane.  It came out from behind a group of trees that was SW of us flying at a very low altitude (the object was parallel with the tops of the trees), and heading East at a very slow pace.  I was confused because it was low flying, slow and noiseless, so I alerted my wife to it and she immediately noticed it also.  We were observing what appeared to be a small bluish-white light with the occasional blink of red light that seemed to be too off tempo to be a planes.  After a minute or so, it finally went behind a larger tree that is taller than the others around it.  Interestingly, I noticed that before it reached the tree it changed direction  going slightly up.  Then, as it wa! s behind the tree, it changed course completely and was now going West with jumpy, erratic movements.  Almost like it was caught on a fishing line and was getting reeled in, at first fast then slow, then almost motionless all the while with an occasional blink of red. This startled me and I exclaimed out loud to my wife and myself.  Ending up behind the same group of trees that I originally first saw it fly out of, it then changed course again coming back out of the trees going east.  At that moment, it was Very bright and shone through the trees whitish light.  Coming into the clearing, it was clearly visible with a star-like shining white-blue light that was glinting off of a dark shape.  The light was brightest on the right side and on the left is where the red blinking light was located.  Finally, with the same unpredictable skip-like movements, it flew behind the tall tree and at that time shone a very bright white light right through the tree at us that illuminated the area.  This made us booth exclaim aloud and as we watched it, it smoothly came out of the other side of the tree, hovering east parallel to the smaller treetops.   It slowly moved east then seemed to stop and descend behind the trees where we lost sight of it for a minute. We knew it was there and shortly later we caught sight of it moving just below the tree tops, kind of going up and down. It was like it was playing hide and seek with us and it made awkward movements right above the trees, going side to side and up and down. Ascending slowly into the sky, it made all sorts of movements, going in all directions. At this time it was clearly visible and I tried desperately to make out what it looked like. It was like a blue-white arrowhead shaped light that was very radiant and star-like. The light it produce seemed to be bouncing off of its own shape on all sides, especially on the right which was clearly arch-like, and the bottom. Now it started slowly moving west, growing in brightness and gaining a clearly defined central triangular light. Going b! ehind the tall tree, it moved in an unexplainable pattern and then slowed dramatically. At this point, I was very shaken up and when I saw it moving around I was like a frightened animal shaking in fear. It was just beyond the tall tree and what amazed me is that it changed from the white light I was seeing to an incredible golden radiance. It stood almost motionless and seemed to be growing much more radiant than before. The shape looked exactly like an angel. Continually moving west, it seemed to turn slightly and stop. That is when we saw something extraordinary. It now had a translucent golden arrow-head shape encompassing the central light and two constant red lights on its left side, one atop the other. The central light was brilliant golden with the same arrowhead shape and light coming from all sides. Then moving west at a quicker pace, I noticed that the central light could have been three lights grouping together in a triad formation right before it disappeared be! hind a large group of trees and we lost sight of it for good. \tI watched this object the entire time it was in view, never taking my eyes from it. In the beginning of the encounter, I had thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me but as I continued to watch, I knew my eyes were fine and I was witnessing something incredible. I was amazed and astounded at what I had seen and exclaimed a lot during the event. Its magnificent star-like radiance left me awestruck. By the time it was leaving, it was large, bright and obvious in the sky, and the golden triangle that surrounded it was very clearly defined. The way this object moved is absolutely unexplainable and confirmed to me that it was definitely not one of our typical aircraft. The event lasted about 15 minutes.",

I looked for it through my rear view upon moving further down the interstate, but the lights had vanished by then.

As I lookup up I saw a fairly bright yellow-orange light with a reddish halo around it moving silently from the NE to the SW.   My wife also saw it.  We could not determine how high up it was as the sky was clear and there was no frame of reference.  It did not seem to be a plane or helicopter as the light did not blink and there was no sound.  It moved moderately fast covering perhaps a 45 degree arc of sky in about a minute.  As we watched, a second light came into view over our roofline from the same direction and on the same route as the first.  It was about 45 seconds behind the first.  Watching the first light, it dimmed as it got further from us, then was not seen.  Changing to watch the second, a third light appeared, same time interval, same path.  This occurred six time; six lights.  Several of them seemed to change their course slightly to the south as they moved away.  Because of our roofline, I was not able to observe where any of them originated. I thought perhaps the lights were some kind of flares suspended from balloons - but they moved too identically for that in my opinion.  Another thought was some type of crafts watching the firework displays for New Years.  However, there were very few fireworks seen; our deck has a good view over the city.  The only other thing I could think of was some kind of night maneuver with our local national guard unit - but I don't think our small unit has six helicopters.  I have read some other observations of similar light sightings over the past months.",

I take my right turn and grab my phone while keeping an eye on what these objects could be.  Front St runs parallel with the Willamette river and along waterfront Park and Marion Street bridge spanning across the river to West Salem.  I started up my video recorder on my phone and was approaching the overhang of the bridge so I discounted the idea that these objects weren't attached to the bridge.  After coming from under the bridge that was when I was able to get a clear and unobstructed view.  These objects were solid red in color and never changed to any other color, just a constant red, I counted at least 10 of these objects all within a loose cluster, they weren't too far from one another and they appeared to be in what I can remember was a zig zag formation, like the letter \"Z\".  At that time I ! was approaching a stop light and was basically right under the formation of these objects.  I was stopped in my vehicle and studying these objects and as I was looking directly at them the upper part of these objects broke formation and slowly started towards the south with the bottom half heading in all different directions, so five broke south and the other five went in random directions.  What shocked me the most was when I witnessed these things break formation none of them made any sounds whatsoever.  I went back to the video I had recorded after I got back to my place of employment and watched it frame by frame and  was able to capture a few screenshots of my siting.",

At first I thought it was an aircraft, but the light emanating from the object didn\u2019t flash in any recognizable pattern as one would expect from an airplane; my next thought was that it was a satellite because the flashes it was emitting were full spectrum, it seemed to be emanating all the colors one might expect to see in a rainbow, but this is where it started getting weird, the object started moving in a back and forth pattern very rapidly for a few moments; something I've never seen conventional aircraft or satellite do.  It would remain in place for a few minutes, moving in a whiplash back-and-forth movement, then it started to wander lazily in random directions, moving in a westerly direction over the span of about one-and-a-half hours before it disappeared from view.  I reported the lights to a ne! ighbor who also confirmed the lights and the same movement patterns I described.  We could not discern any shape, we could only see the flashing/flickering lights; we both described the light as brilliant, agreeing it was far too bright to be a star or a satellite.

I am an avid night sky watcher (meteor showers, planet conjunctions, satellites spotting, comets, I.S.S. passings, etc.), so I am quite familiar with \"normal\" night sky sightings. On the night of January 20th 2014, I saw something I've never seen before.  As I was walking out the back door of my workplace to smoke a cigarette at 11:25pm EST, I first noticed the moon about 25 degrees off the horizon straight in front of me. It was the first clear night we've had in at least a week.  As I was looking at the moon a bright light traveling northeast caught my eye.  This light was traveling pretty much in the same location from my vantage point as the moon so it was easy to see.  My first initial thought was that this bright light was the I.S.S., so I ran to my truck 10 feet away and grabbed my binoculars to look at it.  I put my elbows up on my truck so I was steady and found this bright light through my binoculars.  What I saw as one solid bright white light with naked eye turned out to be a triangle shaped UFO, with 3 lights. I could not believe what I was seeing.  I watched it for 30-40 seconds as it traveled away from me. The details of this object: the front light of the triangle was a huge solid white light. It did not change color or blink.  The back 2 light were the same size but were flashing at random it seems from, white/red/blue.  The elevation was probably a little higher than normal helicopter traffic.  Although, since it was dark it was hard to tell. I saw this thing clear as can be through those lenses. I'm not particularly happy I saw, everyone I've told has laughed at me, thought I was joking around, or just don't believe me.  But, I stand by my story, I know what I saw.",

On November 10, 1991, my cousin and I were subject to an object that not only crossed our paths that night, but would affect both of our way of thinking for some years to come.  It was 10:15 P.M.  Central Standard Time as we were traveling east on highway H and was coming back into the town of Salem, Missouri.  We had just crossed the one- lane bridge that resides approximately 5 miles out of town on H highway, and made our way up and over the hill just \u00bc of a mile past DD intersection.   Upon topping over the hill, my cousin notices what he believes is an airplane to our far left in the cattle ranchers\u2019 field and this object is traveling south.  Upon further notice, we both realized that not only was this airplane descending, but it made absolutely NO SOUND as it made its way across the field and toward H highway in which we were traveling on.  Believing that it was an airplane, we accelerated to approximately 90 miles per hour so as to pass under the plane as it crossed the highway.  The object reached H highway before our car had the chance to pass under it or even get close to it, and much to our dismay the object came to a complete stop above H highway.  As our car came to a screeching halt, it slid up under the object and stalled out. Sitting in the middle of the highway, my cousin and I stared up at the object, still believing that it was some sort of a helicopter, when we both noticed that the object was making no sound, it was not moving, and the unknown object hovered silently not 30 to 40 feet above us.  In fear, my cousin rolled up his window and we sat silently staring up at the craft.  He turned to me and asked \u201cwhat do you think it is?\u201d  To which by this time I realized that neither of us knew the answer to his question.  The object had three circular lights on its underside that were extremely bright.  These lights formed a triangular shape and the light source did not waver in energy, in fact, the lights were so bright that the whole highway was illuminated as though it was daytime.   After sitting motionless above the highway for what I believe was approximately two or three minutes, the craft began to slowly move diagonal from its original route and hovered to a clearing in the open field that lay ! to the right of my car.  The object hovered just above the tree tops, almost brushing them as it passed over them, until it had reached an opening in the field. The object stops again and then, much to our dismay, starts to turn onto its side and then slowly lower itself to the ground.  So close to the ground in fact, that I could see the silhouette of the field grass as the light from the lower of the two back lights shined through them.  After sitting at ground level for no longer than one minute, the object slowly left our side and made its way down the forest that rested to its immediate right.  The object then leveled back out flat to the ground as it traveled and after flying about 300 yards, it ascended at a 30 degree angle.  It flew up into the night sky, never to be seen again by my cousin or myself.   After much deliberation, my cousin and I agreed that we had not experienced any lost time nor have we ever found any explanation for what we witnessed.  However, after attending a recent UFO conference an investigator told me that he has studied triangular-shaped UFOs for some time and with my experience, I had come closer to one th! an anyone that he had ever heard of.  During that same conference I spoke to a psychologist who has studied the phenomena, and he listened to my story and was surprised to find that I had not experienced any lost time.  He began to ask me a lot of questions concerning my childhood and after that evening I began to question many events in my childhood that have followed me even into my adult life.  I have had many strange events in my life, and my children seem to also be affected by some of these phenomena.   After many years of not speaking about the event, I contacted my cousin and asked him to tell me his version of the events, only to find that everything lined-up with my story except the ending where he told me that the object followed outside the car as we drove off.

Where were you and what were you doing at the time? - We were taking a walk in a suburban neighborhood near our apartment, up Cottage St. to \"Clark Creek Park\" with our 4 year old & 7 month old daughters around 6:00 PM. It was twilight but still very light out. 2.  What made you first notice the object? - I don't know, I just looked up into the sky and saw the 1st one of the \"balloon-like\" clusters. 3.  What did you think the object was when you first noticed it? - The objects looked like balloon clusters at first, descending down from the many wisps of clouds high overhead. Then it became apparent that instead they were some \"balloon-like\" cluster UFOs that we'd studied about before. 4.  Describe the object and its actions and motions in detail. - These were the infamous \"balloon-like\" clusters, as well as some single spheres that seemed to slowly move in paths. The 1st group had 3 separate sphere clusters, the 2nd group had 2 separate sphere clusters. Some groups had a red sphere within a cluster of apparently white spheres. We've seen many photos, videos and have read about these \"balloon-like\" clusters before this event today. They would move along on slowly and then seem to stay in the same area for awhile at times.  5. Describe your feelings, reactions and actions, during and after sighting the object. - We had no strange feelings, just excitement. We've had different types of encounters numerous times, but have never witnessed these \"balloon-like\" clusters in person. We've also never gotten any photos or video of any other incidents before this.  6. How did you lose sight of the object? - We never really lost sight of the objects except when they eventually would rise above and beyond certain wisps of high clouds after awhile. We continued on to the public park.  I am emailing photos and a short video clip of the objects",

It was incredibly close.   Then it took a right angle turn going south just about in front of me and began to get dimmer and dimmer with the glow turning more into embers or slight flares and then I could see its outline continuing southward and upward but without light of any kind, just fading into the night sky, but could see the outline for many seconds, without the orange, and the outline did not appear to be round, like the orb was.  Then this exact thing happened again, and again, and again, up to 10 times.  The 3rd one seemed to try to catch up to the 2 in front and sped up a bit, it also seemed larger, and it slightly veered further straight before it took its right angle turn.

My two young daughters and I were at Clark Creek park in Salem, Oregon, 07/14/15 at around 5:10 pm.  The sky was clear and blue with a few clouds and it was a warm nice day.   I looked up near the southeastern part of the sky and noticed a stationary white object that was round, and had a sort of white or metallic look to it.  It might have very slowly moved while we observed it, but I can't be sure.   I had my Canon camera with me at the park, so I started to film it, and it was hard to keep it steady because my kid started crying, as most toddlers do when the stroller stops moving.   My 5 year old was talking about it as we have talked about ufos in the past and she was very interested in it.   It disappeared right before our eyes after only being there for a few short minutes, and we continued walking in the park picking berries.  I looked up again to see and it showed up again in around the same area of the sky.  It sort of had a translucent halo around it that was very! hard to see but I noticed it nonetheless.   It disappeared again and we were pretty excited.   A regular big white airplane showed up and flew past the area we had sighted the ufo, maybe the same height in the sky as well, and according to the size of the plane I'll guess that ufo was maybe half the size of the plane and a much brighter shiny white color.  I have witnessed and filmed some other objects before, and my husband and I are very interested ufo researchers.  He has college background I have graduated high school and we're intelligent and read a lot.  This type of sighting only has me feeling they will be back again.  I have submitted a report to MUFON and uploaded the video I shot today as well.",

Within 10 seconds another bright flash which would make one to believe it was heading in a northeast direction, again, a great distance from the previous flash.  After that we didn't see it anymore. These are large flashes of light and I have been seeing them for a number of years now and I have never seen anyone reporting in them.  The bright flash does not always stay \"on course\", I've seen many nights that it wifi start in the north, appear next to the east, then back to the northwest. Also, based on the timing of the flashes, this light is moving much faster than an airplane or satellite, or the space station.  In fact, I've seen the light on nights when the space station is not flying over our state. I marked 1-3 crafts due to the fact of distance moved between each flash.  Maybe I'm not seeing one flash flashing 3 times but maybe 3 flashes slashing 1time.  (Does that make sense?\"",

As It moved across the sky it appeared as if it were a Chinese lantern but it was too big for that and higher in the sky, yet lower than a jet that was also flying in the area. Because I was walking the dog, and wanted a witness, I started to jog home to alert my wife and son.  Before I reached the house it had slowly disappeared.

They seemed close enough that we should have been able to hear engine noise, but they were completely silent. Each object slowly disappeared into the night sky.

It was a bright luminous mass and while I would describe it as round in shape it did not appear perfectly round or disc-like.  It was moving quickly, was completely silent and moved in a straight line. We tracked the object as it moved in and out of sight behind trees.  It was not high in the sky. Just about the time we lost sight of the object, another one appeared.  It looked like the other one and moved along the same path. Again, we tracked it until it moved out of view.  It was not shaped like a plane and none of us had ever seen anything similar moving in the way these objects did.  One might describe this as having the characteristics of a comet. It gave the impression of a gaseous ball of light, in that it did not appear solid exactly.  And while you could not see through the object, it had a translucent character.  It had soft edges and a glow or aura.  Shortly after this event we did see several planes in the sky, which only reinforced how very unique the previous objects were.",

It was still in the process of being covered since it was only about 10 pm.  I am a loner so I went to watch it alone on one of the benches meanwhile everyone else was sitting around 150 feet from me. There were 2 girls sitting on the other bench near mine to my left.  Everyone was preoccupied in their chatter and I was cold and bored with nothing much to do so I kept looking around.  The moon was to the right and so were the big crowd of students.  However when I looked to the left a very large aircraft went by.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing since I have lived near the airport for 18 years and am very aware how aircrafts look and could easily identify them at night.  This was different though since it was triangular in shape and upon closer inspection it was made of a black metallic object.  I thought I may be overexagerating which is why I I spoke up and asked the girl next to me if she thought the plane looked odd. I pointed the plane out to her and she agreed that it was in fact unlike anything she has seen before. I had my IPad in hand since I was taking pictures of the moon and quickly took pictures of the object. At the same time I was focusing on the sound it was sort of whizzing but it made no sense because there was no way you could hear an airplane in Salem.  It was a hard sound to make out because of the loud chatter and laughing of the students.  It was going too fast my camera couldn't focus so I tried to do the best I could go get one picture that could at least make out the light formation that I was seeing.  Although I could see the plane in decent detail my camera only picked up five lights in a triangular formation.  The sort of formation that birds use when migrating.  I could only get two pictures in poor quality because of how quickly it had happened.  I presume no one else saw it since there was no one freaking out like me or the girl next to me.

Two balls of light appeared  suddenly from the South and traveling North.  They were a distance apart, but simultaniously on the same path and appearing to be going the same speed.   Suddenly, one ball appeared to speed up and merge with the second ball and it became brighter and then they quickly separated never leaving the path.  Immediately after the separation, one vanished and the other faded out.   These lights were very bright like a star, but too low to be a star and WAY too fast to be an aircraft.   Dogs were barking in the neighborhood I can only assume it was from the strange sight, but I couldn't say for sure.

It was shaped more like a personal drone but upon closer inspection it would have had to be HUGE to be so far away.  It was traveling too fast to be a plane or jet, at an angle that would be impossible.   I watched it for a few seconds trying to figure out what it was, then I blinked and it was gone.  It was too high up in the sky to go behind a building or a tree and if it had fallen, I would have seen it.  This is my first sighting.",

The circle would stop, then a minute or two later resume for several minutes.   I cannot be positive of the exact beginning and ending time, but I am very sure that nothing man-made could produce a similar viewing.  The object moved very quickly and erratically, unlike a light of sort, and too severely to have been a drone. If there was a solid object, it was completely surrounded by the round white ball of light.

      "story": "Bright ball of light over Salem, NH; 2 witnesses. I was walking up my driveway whilst taking up the trash barrels with my friend and we witnessed an extremely bright ball of light suddenly flying southwest over my home in Salem.  We both stopped dead in our tracks and I scrambled for my cellphone to take video.   Typically if I see a plane or a satellite, I don't bother even looking for more than a moment as they are very common in my area.  However once what i thought to be a satellite at first slowed down then stopped I had to take a closer look.  Just as i began recording the video the object starting moving as if it never stopped.   There were several small aircraft in the night sky and they're were on their normal flight paths.  It was clear and there were many stars.  Just as the main object started to fade in the distance the object which was just a brilliant white ball of light disappeared over methuen ma just a few miles in the distance but not before a smaller and less luminous object appeared directly above me and my friend.   This object flew quickly over head and was heading south of Salem.  I've seen simular objects before mostly satellites, however these objects were not characteristic of a satellite or high altitude aircraft.  I've been an observer for 18 years and wouldn't report anything that i felt was typical.   After the second object appeared it faded off into the distance.  I checked this site to see if anyone else had any sightings in New Hampshire and they did.  Not exactly  the same as what i saw but ufos have a funny way of changing their appearance.  So their sighting may or may not be related to mine.  Here is a link to the video taken that evening.  I hope it helps: https://youtu.be/g_eCM9OErdo ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the video, and it shows a white speck of light, moving around the Moon, in the night sky.

On this date and time, this investigator spoke with the witness (who is also a relative of mine)  This was in regards to a sighting of strange lights seen from his father's back yard in the area of East Salem, cross streets 45th and State Street on Wednesday 6 Dec. 2017. (witness says it may have been the day before, Tuesday 5 Dec. 2017). How this sighting came to the attention of this investigator, I had posted a photo only with no details of a sighting that took place in Independence, Oregon on my Facebook.  My cousin contacted me through a post that he had seen the same object as he was looking west of Salem the same week of the Independence incident. Witness was out with his dog in the back yard, looked up at about 60-70 degrees off the horizon to the west, saw an object with multiple lights (yellowish at some point) stationary- then seemed to be rotating.  Square lights could be seen, 7 of them in a row, a perfect line. Witness said if he held out this thumb, object was larger than the end of his thumb.  Distant estimated 1/2 to 1 mile west of his location. Witness stated the object was hovering, lights rotating then it blinked out.  It is this investigator's belief that this witness may have seen the same object and lights that were seen by 2 or more witnesses in the Independence/Buena Vista area of Polk County.  Witness sent a drawing of what he saw.  From the drawing showing the 'square' lights/windows it is consistant with the previous report and sighting in Independence, Or.  (See drawing) ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Ron Wright, a skilled and experienced UFO investigator in Sprague River, Oregon, for preparing this report, and submitting it to our Center.

Took out cellphone and began recording object for over 40min.  Took still photos as well.  Object then proceeded to move off away from my vicinity but stopped to hover again.  I walked up the road to get a clearer view away from the tree lin and the object proceeded to loiter around the area for a long time.  It would move left to right then come closer to me never getting as close as I would have liked.   All lights on this object were red and moved in irregular patterns sometimes the horizontal lights would go then the vertical would flash.  I do not believe this object was a standard aircraft as it made no sound.  And I do not believe it was a drone because of ! lengh of time of observation and battery kimitations on drone vehicles.  I went to retrieve a neighbor to witness as well but on returning the object had left.

This was a bit before 8:00pm.  After finishing washing the Jeep, my partner & I drove out behind NAL (business in town) to drive down the road & dry off the majority of the water.  I stopped the Jeep before the end of the road, under a streetlight, to get out & finishing drying it off with a towel. When I was almost done I noticed a VERY bright object up in the sky (circular but bright), towards the east.  At first, I figured it was an airplane or helicopter but the object was moving in too many directions for an aircraft(bobbing up & down, but moving left to right far too quickly for a plane).  I yelled for my partner to look & when he got out of the Jeep he said it was probably a drone, but I\u2019ve never seen a drone with a hazy orb around it.  We couldn\u2019t tell if the bright object  was very far away or somewhat close.  As I told my partner to go get his phone, to take a video  it became I creasingly brighter, & the color changed from a bright white to what almost resembled fire.  The object seemed to shoot off in a matter of seconds to the North & left a small faint trail of yellow light behind where it originally shot off.  We heard the noise of cars on Main Street & the Jeeps engine running.  There was no loud boom, like a jet breaking the sound barrier. I have never believed in aliens visiting Earth (UFOs), and to be honest, I still don\u2019t know what we saw.  After witnessing whatever this was we were both were confused & just laughed about it.  My partners bestfriend is married to a police officer, so we called to see if he was on duty, he was, & to see if anyone else had reported this weird light in the sky.  He thought we were joking & after we explained what happened he told us that it was probably an airplane headed back to the airport or something from Scott Airforce Base.   Again I don\u2019t know what we saw, but I know it wasn\u2019t a drone or airplane.  Maybe it\u2019s something else & you\u2019re sites employees can answer what it was?  We are both scientifically minded, educated adults with good careers & don\u2019t want people thinking we are crazy, but we have gone from confused to almost scared by what we witnessed.  We just want an answer. Ps.  We didn\u2019t know there was a hotline until coming home & researching what happened & finding your site.",

I am writing this witness account the same evening the event took place.  It is fresh in my mind.  The evening was cold  at  49 degrees and it was a waxing crescent moon large in the sky with no clouds to block the views, I could see the stars very well\u2026and Mars also I believe.  I look to my right while driving on Kuebler Ave., heading south, and I saw a silver (dark silver) disk hovering to my right over some large trees in the distance, about a quarter of a mile from me. The saucer type craft  was spinning while hovering mid air.  There were I believe 8 lights around the outside of the disk; red, green and white.  Lights also on the bottom which were white.  I was approaching Battle Creek  Rd. and it started to go straight up then head off towards Fairview Ave. where a lot of businesses and manufacturing plants are located.  I decided to follow it, so I turned right on Battle Creek Rd. I lost sight of it for about 30 seconds then it reappeared.  I pulled to the side of the road and took a few pictures and a video.  The craft made no sound at all.  It would dip down low like it was landing, then I would look far away only to see it back up and further than I would think it could make it in just a few seconds. I felt as if I was playing a game of cat and mouse with it for 10 or so more minutes before  thinking about heading home, my two daughters are in the car with me and I needed to get them home.  It was strange there seemed to be no other cars around just us and this UFO.  I then noticed a second disk shaped hovering craft, identical to the one I saw at first, and it was hovering over a large business.  It was truly an awesome sight.   I was able to get several pictures and a couple short videos before leaving which I will email to you.",

Upon settling in at the bar and waiting for our first order of drinks of the night.  I noticed 5 lights off in the distance.  They were rounding a telecommunications tower off in the distance.  At first I thought it might have been aircraft lining up going towards Logan international airport, but after observing them for sometime the lights were just hanging there not moving, and after several mins they began to move.  I asked several people there that night if that was a normal occurrence.  The two bar tenders and waiting staff replied no, it was the first time they had ever seen something like that.  The lights began to move off in another direction and towards the ground were they were not visible anymore.  If this was a flight pattern for landing air craft there should have been more coming in intervals, but have after these lights were g! one there were no more lights that came.  From my vantage point I believe the lights were near Swampscott, Ma, and the Salem, Ma. Roughly seven mins after being there I took a picture of these lights, and then they began to move, but they were going very slow, not like an ordinary planes flight path that should have looked quicker even at the distance that I was at.  This stuck with me and I wanted to check and see if there were any other reports of these lights and I came across your website. I have seen many things, I am month away from my contract ending with the military and I am Staff Sergeant I\u2019m the Army.  I am aware of the way aircraft work and act during observation Wether fixed wing or rotary.  I also should mention there were no visible indication lights, the normal red-green blinking lights, nor were there any landing lights. What I am describing can be viewed on any aircraft.  These lights did not fit that description.  They looked like white balls of lights.",
