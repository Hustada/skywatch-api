      "story": "Green Fireball Sighted Near Albuquerque Moving Directly Up From the Ground Around July of 1998 my wife and I were driving from Bernalillo, a little suburb of Albuquerque on the way home from work. We had one car at the time, so she was picking me up, although I was driving. On the way we were enjoying the cool air with the windows down. The interstate we were on was essentially empty, only a few cars going by at that time of night ( this was about 1:30 in the morning). As we were driving she was looking out the window, and said \u201cWhat the (expletive) is that?\u201d When she said that, I looked out the passenger side window also. Because the road was so empty, I slowed the car down considerably so I could see what she was looking at. Coming directly up from the ground was a ball of green light. It looked somewhat like a roman candle, but this was far too big to be anything like that. It flew straight from a spot we could not see near the ground, straight up in the air before vanishing. It was very large and moving extremely fast. We were maybe 1000 to 1500 yards from it. The only thing in the vicinity is pueblo tribal land with some small livestock. Our first thought was, \u201cshooting star\u201d, except that it was an intensely bright green, and obviously meteors don\u2019t move upwards from the ground. \tWe both saw it very clearly, and it never changed colors or faded. It simply went up and disappeared, without ever making a sound. Since then, we recently saw another object just like this. This one was a little over a week ago now (4/23/06), and was moving downwards this time. However this time it went through a color change from dull yellow to bright green, then disappeared before it touched the ground. Between us we have seen a number of objects over the years, but this one was very odd. I have never seen anything this intensely green or bright before. I wanted to submit this report because these \u201cgreen light\u201d objects don\u2019t seem too common, and it was a bit unnerving.

      "story": "Seven red orbs followed by two F15s. It was November 2000 and I was stationed at Kirtland AFB, 512th SOS.  My family (wife and newborn) had just come back from the movie theatre.  I parked my POV in the duplex and prior to getting out of the POV I have always scanned the area (situational awareness).  I walked to the back door and something told me to look up, I saw 7 red orbs following each other.  Yes, this is Abq and hot air balloons are rampant but these were not balloons as it was around 2100 hrs.  The mountains are to my east and these red orbs were in southern direction.  The 7th and 6th orb simply faded out.  Orb #5 shot up into the sky to a much higher elevation.  Number 4 thru 1 were still in a southern direction but began to veer southeast.  All of the orbs seemed to be slow moving when from the west came two F-15s.  I could tell they were as their dual afterburners were blowing trying to play catch up.  These two 15s WERE NOT FROM KIRTLAND (as KAFB only had F-16s (single engine afterburners)). ! Number 4 disappeared, #3 turned south and shot faster.  These two F-15s were now following the last two remaining orbs and never caught up.  The remaining two orbs (#2 and #1) just a continuous exact same distance from the 15s.  I immediately went in and switched on the TV to see anything was being reported.  Nothing ever came up in the news.  Our birds (helicopters and fixed wing acft) never flew in a southeastern direction to include commercial acft.  Those two jets were scrambled from another base to catch these orbs as my sister unit (F-16 \"Tacos\") are a reserve unit and no one would have been there to ready the acft.

      "story": "My friend and I were relaxing in a park during the summer of 1986 not far from a friends house where we had left about a half hour earlier. We weren't quite ready to go home yet or call it day. I was reclined under a nearby tree in the park while my friend sat leaning against the same tree. The park was about 2 miles north/northwest of Kirtland Air Force Base not far from a local trailer park. I looked up through the sparse tree limbs and leaves at the stars in the sky above and it was a fairly clear night with a few sparse and thin clouds above but probably 90-95% clear skies.  Suddenly, I began to hear a faint hum off in the distance and the sound seemed to be coming from in front of us but it was hard to determine exactly where it was coming from. The sound became a bit louder probably no more than 40 or 50 decibels. Finally as the sound seemed to be right over us it rose in level to about 60 to 70 decibels. At that time I noticed that the stars directly above me seemed to disappear one by one. My friend and I became aware that a large dark object was now passing overhead.  The object was jet black, and appeared smooth and was shaped rather like chevron but more rounded at the edges rather than square. In appearance it was almost like balsa wood sanded smooth with a coat of jet black paint applied to it. It was approximately 100 meters (possibly more) in length from wingtip to wingtip. The width was difficult to determine but I would say about 100 ft at its widest point. The height I could not determine. It had a row of lights along the leading edge, dim and white and a similar row of lights along the back edge. On each wing tip it had one large bright white light which seemed to be almost yellow at times. Near its front, it emitted a floodlight like light which shone down in front of it onto the ground covering an area probably as large as two football fields or perhaps more. Except for the constant hum it made no other sound as it glided overhead about 1200 ft. off the ground.  It seemed to climb higher and higher as it travelled on a northwesterly course finally changing its direction to northeast and rising higher and higher as it went. The front floodlight seemed to turn off but the other lights were still visible and it finally disappeared over the Manzano mountain range after about 5 minutes. I would estimate the speed as very slow probably 80-100 mph maybe less as it passed overhead. It seemed to move almost like a blimp but more silently and it was certainly nothing like an airplane or a hot air balloon.

Just as I was going back inside two helicopters from Kirtland AFB took off in the direction it had been going. I also noticed some very high jets flying in that direction. I have no clue what it was, but I watch planes fly over all day and it wasn't a plane, it was also too damn big to be a bird.

It was a stainless steel disk and I really thought it was going to zap us before we got out of there but it didn't, any other blinking lights that I saw in the darkness that's why I think there was two of them, about the size of a good-sized living room, since there was two of them they look like smaller ships from the mothership , and I knew our technology hadn't advance to that point, to stop in midair no no waste we just don't have anything like that and I'm sure I should have reported this a long time ago, but I just saw this report on TV talking about the UFO and I got a name so here I am telling my story, when you see something like that it's really hard for you to believe what you have just witnessed!!!

She was driving and I was looking out the window like I almost always do.  I noticed three very bright lights in the sky.  If I remember correctly they were red, green and purple looking.  It was a very unnatural light.  Very Neon like.  They did not flash or anything like that.  At first they were huddled together.  After about a minute of looking at these lights I told my wife to look.  We were on a major road in the middle of town.  She saw the lights.  I kept watching the lights and noticed that they were slowly moving away from each other.  One stayed in the original spot where I saw the lights and the other two were drifting oppositely away from the original location.  The two lights that were moving separated a lot.  I told my wife to keep looking at the lights and she did when she could because she was driving.  I kept watching these slow moving lights for about 2 or 3 minutes and then they just disappeared pretty much all at once.

I go out back every night at my brother\u2019s house where I live, here in Albuquerque, NM, and have a cigar before retiring for the evening.  I did so on February 10, 2007, at about 8:45 p.m.  As I am smoking, I look up at the constellation Orion and at other stars and constellations.  On this evening, I was looking south and slightly west at Orion in the dark, clear, cloudless night sky, when I saw movement to my left out of the corner of my eye.  I turned my eyes to the southeast, and saw what looked like a \"vee\" formation coming from the southeast, on a northwest heading.  The vee consisted of 7 objects, each roughly the shape of a B-1 bomber, only, by my estimation, a little longer from nose to \"tail.\"  They were all the same color, sort of a pale yellow/tannish/gold color, and glowing softly, (it crossed my mind) almost as if lit by lights from the city, but way too bright for that (even if we had enough \"city lights\" in our residential area to provide that kind of illumination) on a dark night.  Each object appeared to have a distinct thin black outline around the glowing colored area.  I say each object, because I distinctly saw dark sky between each of them.  In the approximate minute to minute and a half that I viewed them moving toward me and then close to directly overhead, the vee shifted twice to sort of a \"lambda\" shape (Greek letter).  (Take one leg of the vee, and move the head of it down to the mid point of the other leg.)  The leg of the vee that moved was the leg nearest me, on the west side of the formation.  I yelled for my brother several times, finally got his attention by sticking my head in the door for a second and yelling, then moved back to watch the formation again, as he came rushing out.  He could just make out the formation by that time, fading into the northwest night sky, which was lighter, looking in that direction.  By this time, the glowing color of the objects contrasted against the lighter blue sky was darker, sort of an orange/yellow.  No movement or change in shape was made by each individual object (i.e. no wings flapping)--objects simply shifted in formation, and moved in one direction, and, they were completely silent.  I really cannot gauge the altitude at which they were, but, looking back, had I held up my pinky finger, at arms length, the nail would have, I am pretty certain, completely covered one of the objects.  Related information:  my mother told me the next evening, that she had heard that day, a short blurb on local news regarding sightings of what I had seen the previous night.  The official story, apparently, was that there had been an Air Force exercise of some sort, planes supposedly from Kirtland Air Force Base, which is here in Albuquerque.  (We have either B-1 or B-2 bombers, here, not sure which.)  If this was an actual exercise:  1)\tWhy/how were our Air Force\u2019s planes/jets GLOWING??  (What possible purpose could the capability to glow serve for a war plane, one that is bent on avoiding detection to begin with?) 2)\tThe direction from which they came is not the direction they would have come from, if they had originated from Kirtland AFB, which is southwest from my sighting position, unless they had taken off, made a wide circle, and then come from over or around the Sandia Mountains, which are to the east.",

On the above mentioned time and date, myself and two others were on the \"west mesa\" area, hunting on the public land. At 20:00 hrs. we noticed a single spherical light, just on top of a hill just west of us by about 150 yds. At first we dismissed as being something or somebody wandering around. Then we noticed the object , about the size of a car, hovering above the hilltop about 6 feet off the ground. Immediately following this observation, we noticed two more of same lights duplicating the same pattern of movement, about 10 yards from each other. We then decided to not stick around, and headed the other way, when we noticed the first light we saw coming over the hill and proceeded to follow us. this light hovered above the ground and to my left not even above or on the dirt road. This object began to gain on us, until i was going 50 mph. then it just disappeared. At which time we saw another object hovering about 200 feet off the ground and about 200 yards away. Then it immediately disappeared. No aircraft noise , gradual or sudden increase in speed, and definately not any type of aircraft we were familiar with. At this point being pretty shook up, we headed home in rather hurried fashion, when we noticed the same type of lights hovering over the crest of the sandia mountains, and disappearing as well.",

The aircraft moved out of site to the west and turned around and began flying east toward the Sandia Mountains, but this time I noticed a faint orange light was leading the pack of aircraft.  It was very small, very faint and I could make out no shape, which was odd because the moon was almost directly above.  The shape of the aircraft was quite clear and they also had 3 white blinking lights underneath them.  I continued observe the jets and the orange light fly towards the mountains for app. 30 to 45 seconds, at that time I was observing them from behind the line they were in.  When all I could see was was the white lights on the jets an extremely bright light shot out in front of them, It was orange but extremely bright, so bright that it appeared bigger in size. It moved up at a 55, 60 degree angle and curved straight up.  Afterwards the jets continued to fly towards the mountains and out of site.

      "story": "Bright stationary circular object in high atmosphere in broad daylight gives way to five smaller moving crescents June 8, 2008. Approximately 7:30 PM -- While playing in the backyard with my children, my daughter called my attention to what she called the first star tonight -- she was excited because at this time of year it is still very light, with the sun well above the horizon -- essentially still daytime. I initially took it to be a star, located about 2 degrees NE of a crescent-shaped moon. The size seemed about right for a star, but I quickly realized that it was WAY too bright to be a star, as it was still daylight and no other stars were even faintly visible. I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look. It appeared to be a circular object in the high atmosphere, with a dark spot in the center -- exactly what one might expect from a weather balloon with something suspended below it, such as a basket with equipment. And the brightness of the object seemed consistent with a balloon reflecting the sun. What was strange was that the object maintained it's position relative to the moon for about five minutes, which is not the behavior one would expect of a high-altitude weather balloon that is subject to strong air currents. After a few minutes of observation, the object simply disappeared in a blink. For a good minute I thought it was gone, but with more scoping with binoculars I saw five smaller points of light in the same vicinity. These were too small to be seen with the naked eye, and they were barely visible with binoculars. The mind tries to make sense of things. I speculated that a weather balloon could have exploded into smaller pieces. This time, unlike the initial round \"star\" object, these smaller points were crescent-shaped, and they drifted SW until they moved past the moon, growing more faint as they traveled. It occurred to me that a spherical object in the sky would reflect sunlight in the same way the moon did and assume a crescent shape. This suggests the smaller objects were spherical. This does not explain, however, why the initial \"star\" appeared perfectly round. Forgive me for a flight of fancy, but a flat, round shaped object -- such as a pie tin -- situated at just the right angle would reflect light across it's entire surface and appear round to an observer. I can't come up with an obvious explanation for what I observed. What I saw was certainly not an airplane. Very unlikely it was an exploding weather balloon (how could the intact balloon remain stationary while it's exploded parts drifted in the wind?). Puzzling indeed. One final observation. Seems like an odd coincidence. While observing the crescents in binoculars, a Southwest airline flying at what appeared to be a MUCH lower altitude passed right in between two of the crescent shapes. What are the odds that a commercial airline passes through the tiny window of observation -- relative to the rest of the sky -- visible through one's binoculars at just the right moment under any circumstances? Quite a coincidence. The entire sequence took roughly 10 minutes. Crescents faded from view within 10 seconds of the airline passing through my field of vision. Again, Helluva coincidence. Nevertheless, I really don't think the airline was related to the objects. Airline was low altitude (either landing or taking off from local airport), and the objects were really high.

On March 23, 2008 at approx 12:55 to 12:58 PM , while looking at various high altitude jets and the contrails I notice a small bright white object about estimate 15000 to 25,000ft? It was at 55 degrees to the horizon facing and moving SW to a NE direction heading over and towards the north slope of the Sandia Mountains north of the city limits of Albuquerque. What I observed was what I though was a seagull or white bird catching thermals at a high altitude\u2026the more I looked at it I notice a unusual side to side flight as if it was fluttering like a butterfly might fly. It was moving slow in a NE direction and notice it was blinking every one to three second intervals but at a location different from the other and no sound was heard, giving a fluttering appearance. At arms length the flash was the size of a button. The sighting seem to last two to three minutes before it was beyond the horizon from my view.  It was defiantly below the clouds and my guess is about the same altitude of private single or twin engine planes? I attempted to try and take photos with my cell phone but was unable to.  My second sighting was in August or September? of 1992? (unsure of date and year) on Albuquerque\u2019s Westside at the apartment complex I was living at. It was sunrise on a weekend and I witness a oval, white illumined almost like the moon glow at a 75 degree angle from the horizon going north to south behind one cloud to another going three to four times faster than a commercial jet. At arms length it was the size of a quarter with no sound. A couple also witnesses what I seen and I made the comment to them if it was a shooting star? And one of them said that they don\u2019t think so!

I came to a complete /quick stop on my bike. Then i heard noise to my left ,There were two males doing clean up work (raking weeds ,trash,etc.)About 50 feet across large rain channel/ditch, behind  alot of industrial fenced areas.They looked at what was in front of me and they got extremely frightened .They must of been mexican nationals seasonal workers .They were saying prayers out loud tone making signs of the cross and throwing their tools /rakes /shovels into their truck ,to get out of there in a hury.As for me ,i stayed still kinda frightened but ,curious at the same time.I took my riding glasses off and the object came a few feet closer and stayed perfectly still.It was a pitch black color and no sound came from it .A shape of oval or as  a shape of a large eye ,kinda glossy -it became as it moved up and to the right part of the bike trail.The other 4 or 5 figures seemed to stayed away or as to wait for the one close to me  to rejoin them.After a few minutes ,it slowly went back into a formation with the others and then extremely disapeared fast.       This was amazing for me to see those objects ,on that day ,confusing  although.Because i couldnt figure out what they were . They didnt look like transport ships or saucers ,But maybe a port hole to examine ?Unknown is! what i still call it. But very intelligent is a word to describe that occurance.     After they disapeared i kept riding on the trail back home ,kinda trembling and nervous at what i just saw.When i got home my girlfriend asked me \"What Happened\"? I couldnt talk for a minute still shooken up.I drank water then told her .After i told her she and i noyiced a scent on my clothes.She asked me was i working with fuel or around a generator motor.I told her no I wasnt working around any thing like that . A very strange scent ,almost like the scent around a railroad track where metal wheels travel at a high rate of speed like a burning metal smell.    Strange .   And to this day i never seen those 2 workers over there by the trail. But i might consider to advertise in a local paper to get in contact with them ,if there still here in albuquerque.But if i dont find them or they wouldnt want to talk,its ok .At least i know i wasnt halucinating ,they saw it too.And i want to see the objects again ,maybe to communicate .

I live on the very western edge of the city and further off to the west is where I observed the object(s).  If I had to give a point of reference, I\u2019d say it/they were over the Rio Puerco (so 7-10 miles west of my location?) area and heading west, but very slowly. About 9:45 I was in my side yard which faces west.  I looked up to see an object with several flashing colors of light (red, blue, yellow, green).  It wasn\u2019t moving.  I ran into the house to get a pair of binoculaurs.  Through them I could see the colors better and a faint outline of the object (disk/circular).  It wasn\u2019t a helicopter, no noise, either.  The sunlight was very very faint on the western horizon, and the full moon light on the opposite side of the sky almost \u2018helped\u2019 it stay undetected, if it were not for the flashing colors.  I stayed there watching it for about twenty minutes as it just stayed in place.   Then my partnere came home and I walked inside to tell him what I had seen.  He came outside with me and looked into the sky.  Now there were two of those objects, a bit farther away now, but in close proximity to each other.  It looked like one was going towards the other.  Now, I looked NW and close to the horizon and saw a white light in the sky, not moving.  It could have been a weather balloon, but they usually are seen because the sunlight is reflected off them.  About 5 minutes later, there appeared another of these multi-colored lights N/NW of the white light (the other two are due S of these, still hovering, though they appeared to have moved further west).  This was looked like it was farther/smaller but moving towards the white light.  At one point it looked like it was going to meet up with the white light, but then we saw what could have been an aircraft with identifiable red blinking light trying to 'catch up' to it (jet fighter?) but then this multi-colored object began to retrace it\u2019s path (no wide turning as would an airplan! e), stra ight line towards the white light object, straight line back. The (jet?) aircraft moved away from both. By this time I realized that there were no commercial airplanes coming in from the west, like we usually see.  The white light object went over the horizon and disappeared.  The 3rd multi colored object kept going N/NE until we couldn't see it anymore.  The original two objects moved slowly west, but I couldn\u2019t determine if they were moving up in altitude or just further away.  After about 40 minutes, we saw several planes begin to emerge from the north (not their usual flight path, especially, not directly over our part of the city).  Through the binoculaurs we could see that they were commercial aircraft.",

I was looking nearly straight up when I saw an object entering my field of view from the north.   My first impression was that it looked like a parafoil, but a second later, it was clear that it was something else entirely and very strange. It was shaped like a deeply-bowed crescent with pointed tips, dimly illuminated by city lights, not obviously metallic, not glowing or showing lights.  I called it to my wife's attention and she saw it as it passed almost directly overhead going south.  There was no sound. The heading remained constant and in just a few seconds, it was lost in the darkness.  It crossed approximately 45 degrees in about five to ten seconds.  There was no way of determining its size or distance, but we both had the impression that it was relatively low, small, and fast. It did not seem to be a flock of birds or a single bird.  The shape was constant...no fluttering or wavering. It seemed like an artificial object.  It did not resemble any aircraft I'm familiar with.",

Living in Albuquerque we are used to seeing aircraft, including the stealth fighter every now and then and the occasional air show. To us, lights in the sky are quite common.  However, on this night (tonight) we were driving home from the gym and as we turned down and adjacent street from the main road on our way home I saw two objects racing *fast* on a SE to NW direction.  No biggie, right, except these things were traveling really quickly across the sky in tandem.  I stopped the vehicle and pointed the objects out to my uncle.  We continued to drive around the corner (and had to to keep it in our sights). Here is the kicker... The object forward most was a cobalt bright blue glow. We thought is was an afterburner of a jet. But wait...following behind was another craft which had identifying FAA blinking lights. The light was red so we figured it was the starboard light that was flashing. The craft were equidistant from each other and by that I mean that the craft following or *chasing* the blue sphere didn't gain any ground nor lose any ground. As the craft flew out of sight, the blue cobalt sphere faded. We think this is because is was moving out of range of vision. The other continued to fade, too, meaning that the flashing red FAA light got dimmer and dimmer as it moved away from us. We had second thoughts on the afterburner glow as the craft following was keeping pace and did not show afterburner glow as one might expect. Also, the sphere did not have any identifying FAA flashing lights. It was a constant color and did not flicker. It is our belief that the former object was one of our (USA) jets. Neither took off from the airport as their trajectory was not that of a departing plane. We heard no sound of any kind and felt both objects were low enough to have been heard as they passed. They were about a 30 to 35 degree angle from our juxtaposition to the horizon. It was a crystal clear night and, NO, these weren't stars as stars do not fly across the sky at these speeds. There were no tree's obstructing our view and in fact we had to drive forward several times in order to avoid any objects such as houses and trees.  Basically, we were able to keep it within our sights with little trouble. There were not tails like that of a \"shooting star or comet.\"",

I went outside to see what was going on as their behavior made me think something was definitely not right.  Once I got out in the driveway of my house I saw one of the jets at about 9,000 ft altitude just shredding across the sky.  He made a couple really crazy maneuvers and then headed north of where I was located.  I was looking south.  As soon as the jet made it approximately 4 or 5 miles north of my home, my attention was caught by two other jets following the previous jet.  (I believe they were either F-16\u2019s or F-18\u2019s).  As soon as they all were north of my location, as I was still looking up I saw a tremendously bright purple rectangular shaped light moving straight southbound at a speed that no human made aircraft (that we know about)  could travel at.  The object was gone as soon as it had appeared.   About 20 or so seconds later the jets flew over again in a v shaped three man formation and were still going full after burner.  After this they (the jets) all headed straight south seemingly after the object and disappeared.",

On 1/16/09 @ approximately 6:30 pm I was taking some trash outside and putting into the trash container. I then sensed movement.

Different from any other aircraft that I have seen in the night. The third light/sphere was situated above the other two spheres sort of in a \"club\" like formation. The sphere was approximatly 1/3rd smaller than the other two directly below it. The light color was a faint yellowish maybe kind of orange light. Movement was silent and moderate, but detectible by my senses. The altitude I estimated at approximately 200 to 250 ft. With my past military experience I would say this craft traveling at this low altitude is undetectible by radar. this instantly raced through my mind. I dont know why. The total approximate view time was approximately 10 to 12 seconds. It seemed much longer. I did a post mock-up this morning. Positioning myself and timing approximate viewing time. Not more than twelve seconds. The craft was moving in a northeasterly direction. Speed was approximately 300 ft per second. While viewing. At approximatly the 7th second. [Estimated on my post mock-up also]. The two lower light spheres suddenly turned off. Leaving the third smaller faintish yellowish light sphere. Still travelling at the same rate but, getting fainter losing light and shape, then totaly vanishing. I was'nt scared or startled. Just marveled,concerned, and sort of disturbed. As I feel presently. Finally. I have experienced seeing moving lights on different occasions. I always figured they have to do with the nearby airport and airbase. My experience last night was real and vivad. Recordable.

I woke up a 02:19 and made myself a cup of coffee and sat outside on the front patio enjoying the peace and quiet.  From the patio which faces east I have a 180 degrees view. At approximately 03:15 I was looking to the north and noticed a dull yellow/orange light moving from west to east across the Rio Puerco valley.  I estimated that the aircraft/light was 6 to 8 miles away and moving much faster than the normal aircraft on  approach to Albuquerque International Airport which is nearly due east 19.5 miles to the control tower.  I am guessing that the altitude was 5000 AGL.  This is only a guess. I followed the object with the naked eye until it entered a low thin cloud.  I was curious about the fast moving light so I got up out of my chair and search for the object.  After a minute or so the object appeared out of the top of the cloud.  At this point the light began to flash a very bright red and white strobe.  The object headed west again and seemed to trace it's path back.  I went into the house and got my 8x35 filed glasses and video camera. I returned outside and followed the light with the field glasses. Then the light began to jump around.  Up and down and left to right.  At first I thought I might be moving the field glasses.  There was a large star in the northeast that was in the field of view and it was not moving, so it was the object that was jumping around. I went to the north patio to follow the light's westerly track. The light moved across the Rio Puerco valley at a rapid pace, but not beyond current F16 military aircraft capabilities which operate out of Kirkland Airbase (ABQ International). At this point I tried to video the light, but the battery was dead.  The valley is approximately 5 miles wide where the light made its westerly track and it took approximately 5 minutes to cross the valley.  As the object crossed over the Rio Puerco River it began to jump around again.  The erratic movements covered the entire field of view of my field glasses.  Again I tried to make sure I wasn't moving the field glasses, but there were no stars visible in the west, northwest because of a slight cloud cover and the brightness of the moon high in the south, southwest, but I did use the edge of the western horizon as a reference point when possible.  Same results the light was jumping around. During the period of erratic movements the object was flashing a red and white strobe light similar to conventional aircraft.  I followed the light/object for several more minutes as it seemed to pass over the north lava fields of Mt Taylor.  At this point it was not moving oddly, but the red and white strobes continued and I returned into the house. The temperature was approximately 70 degrees and there were clusters of thin clouds.  Visibility was very good.  Humidity was high for the Rio Puerco valley.  A near full moon was high in the Southwest.  Winds were from the north at 1 to 2 knots.

A large, lit cigar-shaped object was noticed by me moving at a slow velocity in a westward-slight northwest ward direction. The object, when first noticed at 21:31 PM was in a general position of 45 degrees above the southernmost horizon of Albuquerque and moved to a stationary position approximately 15 degrees above the western most horizon above Albuquerque\u2019s Nine Mile Hill by 21:34 PM. At 21:33 PM, I placed a call to Albuquerque 9-1-1 to inquire if anybody else had reported this event also. At the intersection of Central and Carlisle NE, the object\u2019s light dimmed slowly for approximately two seconds, then intensified greatly. While eyeing the object, we drove 1/4 mile southwest to a higher vantage point in the city at Lead and Amherst NE. My girlfriend and I parked and exited the vehicle to concentrate on the unfolding events. What appeared originally as a singular, intensifying object was \u201cgrowing\u201d into a crescent-shaped object with now two other, distinctive intensifying lights; equaling now three, bright lights. At 21:36 PM, I placed a call to my boss who lives in far NE Heights section of Albuquerque with a view towards the west for his opinion on the events. He witnessed the object immediately with his naked eye and later with great detail via a telescope. The object appeared to be a structure hundreds of stories tall. As it was positioned stationary, the bottom light (which was what appeared to be the original cigar object)was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in the sky. The top of the structure(what was the third light) was at the 25 degree mark above the horizon. The second light was at the 20 degree position between the two lights. Again, all three light were arced in a crescent shape, with the 25 degree light being the northernmost. The lit object/s was/were visible from my vantage point until 21:51 PM. From 21:36 PM to 21:51 PM. From 21:35 PM to 21:38 PM , smaller, ancillary objects/lights appeared to rotate and fly around the stationary three, main objects/lights. From 21:39 to 21:41 PM, a large, unlit structure (close in appearance to an Eiffel Tower like-shaped structure) appeared from the extreme top of third light located at the 25 degree mark above horizon. At 21:49 PM, I placed  a call to my parents home in Seattle, Washington to describe to them what was happening. At 21:50 PM, 25 degrees above the horizon light dimmed, but was still visible. At 21:50:30 PM, 20 degrees above the horizon light dimmed, but was still visible. At 21:51 PM, 15 degrees above the horizon light (and the original lit object)dimmed completely; object and lights completely ceased from view on the horizon.",

      "story": "Bright teardrop flys over the freeway in ALbuquerque I was driving home from a local television station after dropping off a friend at the university (UNM) campus on Central Avenue. On the freeway to go home,  I had just gotten on I-25 from the frontage road and was somewhere around the exit for Montgomery road. As I was driving I happened to look up through the windshield at what I though was a reflection in the glass from behind. However, when I looked up the light was coming from an intensely bright object in the sky, maybe (I'm estimating here) about 45 degrees up from the horizon of my car hood. The object was shaped like a tear-drop on it's side. I almost thought it was a comet at first, but then I realized it was completely solid looking. It looked like it had a tail except the \"tail\" was as solid as the rest of the object and very distinct. There was none of the hazy quality you usually see with a comet's tail, plus it was clearly all one piece, with no detached parts. Also, it was really low in the sky so I could see it very clearly. I'm thinking a comet that close to the city would be pretty much impossible. The object was about the same altitude as planes are when they are coming in to land at the airport nearby. There was a red \"aura\" for lack of a better word springing to mind, out in front of it...but only around the curve where the \"front\" of the object was based on the direction it was travelling (west to east across the sky). The object was moving really fast. It crossed an area of the sky about as wide as my windshield in probably less than a second. I got a good look at it but only briefly before it flashed a kind of bright blue and was completely gone. It did not go over a horizon or behind any buildings or cars and the Sandia mountains were still a good distance away from where it disappeared. It just flashed bright blue and was gone. There was no sound, and no trace of anything left in the sky. The night was largely clear (at least I didn't notice any clouds), with very good visibility. You could see all the constellations really well and there were not an inordinate amount of vehicles on the road, about average for a Tuesday night. I can say with certainty that this was not a reflection, a balloon or lamp, a shooting star, or anything else. It was way too solid, distinct and fast (and pretty big at that) for any of those things. It moved in a fairly straight line before disappearing. I looked around to see if anyone else noticed it, but honestly couldn't tell if anyone had. I hope someone else did because I'd like to compare notes and see what they saw. It was very intense,solid, bright and quick, but it was one of those moments where there is no doubt about the details of what I saw. I don't drink or party or anything and I got a really clear look at it. It was definitely odd looking and not something I could explain. I wish I could say I had snapped a pic, but it was gone too quick.",

      "story": "Short cigar shaped object with rays of light eminating from one end; stayed in the sky for 2 hrs+. Initially this was a white light that emitted periodic white starburst-like rays that stayed fairly close to the center point of light. It would periodically move in a jerky manner and then stay completely stationery for a while. When the object came closer it appeared to be a stubby cigar-shaped tube and continued to emit light rays periodically from a central light point. At one time, for about 20, minutes a central point of light would appear (like a stamen on a flower) and the object would rotate around as though it were a satellite dish scanning the area below it. I went and got a neighbor to see it so I could be sure I wasn\u2019t losing my mind or something. He didn\u2019t know what to make of it but didn\u2019t really seem to care and went back inside. I sat in my truck bed, realizing it was not a man-made object, and opened my arms wide and tried to mentally will it to come to me (if this makes any sense). To my amazement, it moved almost directly overhead and mov! ed closer, at which point I could no longer see the object but only the radiating light. It came closer to me and became like a cat or fox\u2019s face with the light rays being like whiskers or something. It would come closer, actually very close, and immediately recede if I moved arms or blinked, as though it were tentative or shy. It seemed to prefer it when I crossed my arms over my chest rather than spread them wide. After ~15 or 20 minutes of this the cat\u2019s face transformed slowly into almost the classical \u201calien\u2019s face\u201d. Then it seemed as though I was looking down the wrong end of a telescope; everything became dark around the outside and a narrowing circle of light was at the end with a being at the center who became increasingly wrinkled as the circle closed. I felt almost paralyzed but really started to freak out so I waved my arms and the whole thing retreated immediately. It then came closer and retreated but with the \u201calien face,\u201d not the cat\u2019s face. I watched this f! or probably 30 minutes and then figured that while this was a ! unique a nd weird thing going on there was no point in watching it any more and went inside to go to bed. I did look out the door a few times and the thing stayed around for maybe 10 minutes and then was gone. I know this makes me sound like a whack job or something, but I\u2019m generally a very skeptical person and have multiple science degrees. So there it is.

Height was under 1000 ft.  Plane possibly looked like a C-130 (it was getting dark so it is hard to tell exact aircraft).  The plane was flying north along the east side of the Sandia Mountains.  The reason I looked up is because I could hear the engines as it was pretty loud and low flying (planes do not typically fly this close to the ground as the airport / Kirtland AFB is about 15 miles to the south. After looking at the plane, noticed a weird object in front of the plane.  The plane appeared to be following or chasing the strange object.  What the object appeared as was a figure 8 pattern with flashing blue/green lights moving on the outside of the figure 8.  The figure 8 object actually looked like an 8 on its side.  I could not tell if the space between the outline of the figure 8 was solid as it was getting dark.  I could just notice the blue/green lights circling around the figure 8 pattern. I spent 12 years in the USAF and have been around aircraft for years.  I also work on Kirtland AFB and am familiar with flight characteristics and aircraft types.  The only thing that I would even guess this could be is an Osprey aircraft (which they have at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque) due to the large propellers.  Unfortunately, I have never seen the propellers radiate a blue/green light in the strange pattern.  I would also not understand why it appeared to be followed by a C-130 size aircraft.",

It traversed the sky at about 60 degrees above the horizon and 10 degrees too the right of the fireworks display from my perspective.  The trajectory was on a straight line from South, South West to North, North East.  It was light grey in color with some darker grey covering 1/3rd of the bottom.  It was visible for about three to four seconds and seemed to disappear into the sky.  It did not appear to be rotating.  There were no lights on it.

I had just climbed a steep hill, and decided to rest on my back on top of a large flat rock. It was around 3 p.m. in the afternoon, and the moon was about one-third of the way between straight up and the western horizon. I was watching military jets as they raced across the sky leaving vapor trails behind them. I then spotted a bright light, similar to the planet Venus, moving eastward at a speed similar to the jet aircraft.  I assumed that it was another jet much higher up, and the sunlight was glinting off it.  It was not leaving any vapor trail.  As it passed almost straight above me, it started making a sharp arc of 90 degrees (about the same radius as the moon), and simultaneously coming to a complete stop.  I kept watching it, but after about 20 minutes, it was noticeably starting to slowly fade, but still not moving again. After 10 more minutes, it had completely faded away, and I could no longer see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Silent sphere with multicolored lights floats slowly over Albuquerque then shoots north then west out of sight. I don't remember the exact year or month but it was in the summer of '87 or '88.  I parked my car in front of my parent's house in NE Albuquerque and got out when I spotted a spherical object with different colored lights flashing randomly.  It appeared to be about 50' in diameter and moving from east to west approximately 300' above the ground.  I'm a pilot and am pretty good at identifying aircraft, altitudes and distances.  The object was moving slowly, maybe 40mph, and was silent.  My first thought was this was a weather balloon and someone had rigged it with Christmas tree lights and a battery as a hoax.  I couldn't tell if the orb was tumbling randomly or if the lights just made it appear so. When the object had gone about 2 miles west of me it shot north (maybe 15 miles?) and immediately west and upward until it disappeared in the distance.  It did this in less than a second or two and made the 90 turn from north to west without slowing or arcing.  This was NOT a weather balloon nor am I aware of any aircraft that can move that quickly or perform an immediate change in direction like I witnessed. I was stunned in amazement at what I'd just seen.  I saw a man and a woman who were at a park about 4 houses up the street and asked them if they saw it.  They said they did and asked me what it was.  I asked them if they saw it shoot north and west and they had.  I wish now that I had talked with them more to compare our observations regarding size, shape, distance and speed.",

I tried taking video, but nothing was showing on my camera, so I tried taking photos...again nothing.   By this time I was frustrated.  My mother had seen all of this too, so I know I,am not crazy.

      "story": "Bright light heading for Earth near Albuquerque, NM Pictures of this were taken just as the sun was going down. I have emailed three photos of this UFO event to you. I was heading South on Hwy 550 from Bloomfield, NM and was about 50 to 60 miles North of Albuquerque.  The pictures were taken with a Canon Digital Camcorder  Model NTSC ZR200. When I first saw two bright lights in the sky to my left, about 10:00 or 11:00 in the sky, I pulled my car over and got my camera. Two other vehicles pulled over behind me and appeared to be watching this, also. The light balls were not moving much at this point.  I was so excited, I forgot to put my camera on movie mode so all I have are the still photos. Two light beams came down from the sky at an angle from the two light balls to my left. The light beams changed their angle a few times as the light balls moved a little.  Then, suddenly the two light balls formed into one larger light ball.  The two light beams coming to earth formed into three beams, then instantly, there was only one light beam. The light ball came to Earth VERY FAST at an angle following the one remaining light beam.  Then the light ball got much brighter, like it was on fire and it was leaving a \"fire trail\" behind it, not a long one. As it got closer to Earth, it looked like an explosion took place.  I snapped a picture of this \"explosion\" then it took off for the sky again.  It was traveling very fast.  It went up and over the hill to the right in the photo then went straight up in the sky at a rapid rate of speed.  It disappeared in a matter of a few seconds very high in the sky.  There was no noise whatsoever. I dropped my camera after taking the picture of the \"explosion\" and took off in my car.  I looked for signs of fire on the ground to the right of the highway where it might have been close to the ground and saw nothing. It appeared to me that the \"explosion\" may have happened about 1/2 mile ahead of me. My Father was a Navy jet pilot (career Navy) so I was raised around all kinds of aircraft.  This was not a \"normal\" aircraft.  I am a bookkeeper and office manager for an accounting firm.",

I was camping on a high elevation, on the top a rocky and treeless overlook, in a family tent with 4 other family members. They were all asleep. I was lying on my camp cot inside the tent.  My point of view was initially flat on my back, looking out of a very clear, new and clean net window.  Since I was on my back, what I saw at first was upside down. I saw lights at first, which ordinarily wouldn't have interested me, except that these were arranged in a small tight circle, and were spinning very fast, rising into the sky sharply with out sound, stopping and dropping suddenly.  I rolled over, sat up, and looked out of the window. There was no cloud coverage, no known or readily identifiable lights present other than the ones I a describing as unusual.   The best way I can give a familiar visual of what I saw is to compare each lighted object as shaped exactly like the cereal called \"Honeycomb Cereal\" but with lights where the holes are.  Each object would enter my line of sight from the lower left corner, from an area hidden by a ridge in the foreground.  Each one would \"shoot\" rapidly into the sky from the lower left area, diagonally across to the upper right, stop, spin rapidly for seconds, and fall faster than it ascended, and all in silence.   Each one was followed by another, in rapid succession, by other objects of the s! ame shape and lights, however some were smaller in diameter.  Each object was circular, but like the cereal, I could tell at the moment  that they would pause before dropping, that there were lights on the sides which spun around the object.   These lights were oval, not round.  The lights underneath, about three per object, were round.   All the lights were white, they did not blink.  The round lights were starionary and moved with the object-attached.  The oval lights were also attached, but did not seem to be stationary.   There were 14 seperate objects.  I remember very well, because I took care to count each one as it appeared from behind the ridge. I cannot explain why I could not wake my family.  I couldnt stop staring at the sky.   I also couldnt speak because I tried. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

We took turns looking through the binoculars, always keeping this glowing object in sight.

Our viewing was from the West side of the city, looking West). This object continued to glow and remained in this position for about 5-6 minutes...then all of a sudden it projected left horizontally about another 1/2\" and remained in this position for a few minutes. We continued watching, mesmerized and wondering just, \"what is it???\"  for about 30-35 minutes.

I was looking at the beautiful New Mexcio clear blue sky.  Looking directly north up at the sky at about 50 degrees, a white object appeared out of nowhwere.  It started off slowly and began moving in a straight line directly east towards the Sandia Mountains.  I couldn't gaug e how big the object was nor how high it was.  It appeared to be pretty high, object was small and appeared white.  As it moved east, it slowly picked up speed and then &quot;whoosh!&quot;, .... it went so fast it was gone in a heartbeat. Now I consider myself a pretty level headed person.  I'm not big on conspiracy theories, contrail chemicals, government cover-ups, or .... UFOs.  But ..... I know what I saw. I live in Paradise Hills was was looking north when I saw this. Question:  Did anyone else in the Albuquerque area see this?  No .. I wasn't drinking nor taking drugs.  And yes .. I was plenty hydrated. My primary need is I would like to know if anyone else witnessed this??? Thanks.",

I have been in this home for 18 years and am very familiar with my piece of the night sky, both summer and winter.  I have never seen anything like this.   The same object appears in the Western sky each night at about 22:00.  I first noticed it Thursday (8/30) and have seen it every night since, except Monday, however, there were clouds in and out of the sky that night in my area.  The object hangs for about an hour is no longer visible to me at 23:00.  It approaches f! rom the South and appears the about 50-60 degrees above the horizon, over the hour, it heads North about 40 degrees and then heads West until it becomes too small to see easily, and then disappears.  The same pattern repeats every night.  It makes no noise at all. NONE. It has a bank of lights that flash red and green that are on the top and North/right side only, the South side of the object is bright white. The shape is oval(ish) but it curves inward on the bottom.                                                     I can easily identify the planes that approach and leave the area, all are obvious and I can hear them.  This object is completely quiet.  An Osprey or a Harrier or any kind of heliocopter would make some sort of sound. Jets can't hang in the air like this does.                                                                   Also, on Saturday last, 9/1, it was accompanied by streks of light that approached in one set of 3 lights, from South to North, two sets of 2 light came in, one set approached from the South to North, the other set of 2 approached from the North to South and there were several single streaks. Only one that I saw approached from top to bottom, which would have been East to West.  One streak, the last one I! saw, appeared from North to South and appeard to vere off halfway through.  All approched at the same angle, maybe a 15 or 20 degree angle, and all had the same length &quot;jet trail.&quot;  The light trails lasted a couple of seconds.  All were headed to the same location - which was about where the object was hanging in the sky.  The streaks started at about 23:30 on Saturday and continued through Saturday night and again on Sunday night. The last streak I saw was at 04:15 Sunday AM.  I saw none during the daylight hours. I saw eleven streaks total and have seen none since...I have never seen these types of lights in the sky.  Let me know if you find anything.  This has me stumped!",

      "story": "White rectangle seen falling and then speeding off apparently under power of two \"cones\" of orange lights that suddenly came out I am a technical writer with a degree in geology.  On 4/25/07, I was at a meeting being held near the local airport and Kirtland AFB. I went outside during a lunch break and was just standing on the sidewalk, relaxing with a cigarette (sorry!), looking around. Several people were walking to their cars, etc. However, I was apparently the only person who looked up and saw what appeared to be a very stiff piece of white paper or cardboard in the air, seemingly close by and floating down toward the ground in a back and forth motion. (I feel like wincing since it seems so trite, but it was making that classic \"falling leaf\" motion that so many people report.)   It did not bend as a I expect a piece of paper would, but remained stiff the entire way down.  It had about the same relative dimensions of 8.5 X 11 paper, which is what I first assumed it was, and was coming down with the longest side on the vertical axis. The shorter, top side was tilted toward me at about 20 degrees, which became progressively more acute until the \"flat\" side was almost horizontal to the ground.  However, I could continue to see almost the entire rectanglular shape. I thought this was odd as I shouldn't have been able to see that much of the rectangle if the object were as small and as close to me as I thought it was (I wasn't directly under the object so, if it was a piece of paper at that angle and assumed distance, I should have seen no more than a sliver of the rectangle from the new angle).  I did not have any sense of there being any substantial \"depth\" to the object. Also, believing this was an 8.5 X 11 piece of stiff paper, I thought to myself that it would surely hit me in the face very shortly.  However, as time went on, this \"piece of paper\" did not appear to get any closer to me as it was falling, which also convinced me that it was much larger and much higher than I originally estimated.  This made me more curious so I continued to watch it. After at least 2 minutes of slowly falling back and forth, and slowly tilting from vertical to horizontal, the object seemed to catch an updraft and went spiraling back up very quickly.  It started with wide circles that got progressively tighter and tighter until it suddenly stopped moving after about 10 seconds. At its greatest height, it once again started falling toward the ground in the \"falling leaf\" motion, only was now oriented horizontally to the ground.  This time it fell for only about 15 seconds before it again spiraled upward for about 5 seconds. I was then astounded to see two garish, neon-like orange \"cones\" of light/flame suddenly spew out of the northernmost face of the rectangle and the entire object quickly and silently left the area very steadily and heading southeast in a straight line. It no longer looked like a piece of paper, but looked like a rectangular vehicle that was being confidently driven. It's trajectory should have taken the object directly over the airport, if not also the air force base. It was out of sight in less than 5 seconds and never deviated from it's beeline course. When I returned to the meeting, I did tell my coworkers what I had seen. I had never seen a UFO and had never heard of a rectangular one. I thought at first it may have been a giant piece of cardboard that had presented some \"flip\" side to me that had orange cone shapes painted onto it, creating an optical illusion. However, the white rectangle did not change its height/width ratio as one would expect if one side were completely white and the flip side was only 2/3 white. (The orange flame-like cones were about 1/2 the size of the rectangle. If they were painted on there, the rectangle on the painted side should have looked more like a square). At any rate, I do not know what it was. About two weeks later, one of my coworkers excitedly told me she had heard there had been sightings of a similar object in Alaska around the same time, but I was never able to find any such reports. I called MUFON to see if they had reports like mine, but they said they hadn't heard of any. NOTE TO EDITOR: I have two more odd occurrences to report which I will be doing under separate cover.  They are each unique and would be just a mishmash of sightings over the years if I were to combine them here.  I was diagnosed as terminally ill recently and wanted to document my UFO-ish experiences before I am no longer able.  This is most certainly not exaggerated, embellished, or fabricated (it's not that great or dramatic of a sighting anyway); but I freely admit it may have been nothing more than an optical illusion.  Nevertheless, this experience has always puzzled me, especially since finding out that there are, indeed, rectangular UFOs. Were it not for the cones of orange light/flame popping out just before the object took off on its steady southeast course (after acting like nothing more than debris in the air for several minutes), I probably would have forgotten about it, but now I just don't know what I saw that day.",

When:   Tuesday evening, March 6, 2012 Time:  Approx. 8:40 pm (Albuquerque time) Viewed from:  Airplane en route from Chicago; beginning of approach into ABQ over populated area - could begin to see major roads and lights from buildings, homes, etc. Observation:  From the rear, port side of the plane:  a series of several (maybe 6 or 7) extremely bright bursts of light.  Given the altitude, it seemed too bright and too wide to be the beam of (for instance) the light on a police helicopter.  Furthermore, a couple of the lights turned very quickly at right angles and did not \"sweep\" in the way a searchlight would have moved. The best way that I can describe the 'shape' of the light is to ask you to picture a comet.  There's the head of the comet and then the tail that gradually fades out. These bursts of light were like that, only they were in reverse of the direction that a comet would go.  In other words, if traveling west, the tail would come first and then the brightness would race ahead and then just black out. I can't guess the distance that they moved over, but from the plane window, I would say it covered a good 6 inches, so on the ground, that would have been pretty far, maybe a mile??  The lights were bright white.  Again, a couple of the lights turned in different directions, but the majority of them just went straight. There weren't a lot of people on the plane and I didn't hear folks talking about it as they got off in ABQ.  I did go up and talk to the pilot before the new passengers boarded for the rest of the flight to Tucson, but he didn\u2019t see anything because he was focused on the approach to the airport.  He suggested it might have been some military exercises, but since it was over a populated area,  I discount that theory. Whatever it was, was very interesting and certainly unforgettable!",

It sped in from the sky (down and from the east)--looked white/yellowish and moved like a shooting star, then began moving horizontally at a much slower speed and turned green.   Object moved at a regular, even velocity in a westward direction until it disappeared about 7 seconds later.  It was truly the strangest thing I have ever seen.  My boyfriend was driving the car and I was passenger.  I was in the middle of a sentence and just stopped speaking and pointed. My boyfriend noticed right around the time I did (and he was driving--that's how noticeable this object was).   As soon as the object disappeared, we both turned to each other and said, \"Did you just see that?\" During the observation, we were both so stunned by what we were seeing that neither of us could speak.  It looked so out of place and unlike anything else either of us had ever seen. I wish I had seen more.  Please let me know if you know anyone I can speak with who is familiar with these objects, and with ufos in general.  I have many questions and am very concerned that what I have seen is not of this planet.  I want to know why it seems like the government is hiding information from the public on this issue.  Thanks very much for any assistance you can provide to me. I hope I have given you some information you can use. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any more questions or information to share.  Take care, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

I was walking by the window at work and i casually noticed a black crow flying by and it caught my eye, so i looked at the bird and after it had passed the window i noticed a black diamond shaped object off in the distance.  The object also caught my eye because it wasn't moving, instead it just sat there.  It was then that I took the time to go outside in the parking lot for a better look. Immediately I noticed that it was not moving up or down or left to right.  It was however, rotating in place slowly. I was trying to make sense that maybe this was a kite, but there was no wind and it was clearly rotating.  Plus, the area at which it was hovering over was all industry and a very busy intersection, so no kid would be flying their kite in that area.  Then, i decided to get a few employees to come look at it to see if they would have an answer.  They were just as stunned as me. I even got a customer to co! me look at it and they too were stunned.  As I focused more and more on its detail, I noticed it had a haze around it and the surface reflected light because when an area of the object rotated into the light, it reflected it, looking smooth and metallic. There may have been a light on one tip of the \"diamond' but I couldn't be for sure.  Eventually it started to drift to my left and up slowly, and it got to about 600 ft or more, and by this time I knew it couldnt have been a kite because it crossed over the busy street it was hovering over and drifted like 1 block left. no kite string could be that long. This area is a very busy place and other people had to have seen this that morning.",

I was sitting there just staring at the mountain.  I heard some type of chanting in the canyon.  I listened for about 5 to 10 min then called Ron to come verify what I was hearing. He Heard it too.  We listened to it for 5 more min maybe. We began telling everyone to listen to what we were hearing.  Then next thing we see is what appeared to be a light.  Very small in size.  Looked like a flash light start at bottom of the mountain and began to make its way to the top.  It maybe took about 10 seconds to make it to the top. At that point everyone was focused on the small light.  Then what happened next scared us all.  Once the light made its way to the top about 5 seconds a purple sphere came from the top of the mountain and hovered there.  It was bright!! Looked like a flare at first.  That's what it reminded me of.  It was no flare thou.  It hovered for maybe 10 seconds .. It then got brighter then at a 45 degree angle shot off into space.  I guess..  It left a tail behind it.  Then was gone. Me and my dads hunting friends put the camp fire out.  And were in shock.  We all went inside our campers.  What we seen was some other type of technology.

The sky conditions were clear with no cloud cover in any direction northeast to southeast.  There was a flock of common house finches in the tree with a flurry of chirping at this time.

It was also in the form of a cylinder about so, I first though it was Comet ISON.  Of course that was ruled out as it is scheduled to pass in Nov, and then I ruled out aircraft types, and balloons.  The object remained in the same spot on the sky for the ent! ire duration of 15 min.  The object was as bright as a sewing pin head held at arm\u2019s length for the duration.  It seemed to be above the traffic departure pattern at the airport, estimated at 15000\u2019.  Aircraft traffic taking off towards the east did not seem to be near it vertically or horizontally; however, I can bet radar would have picked the object up. The object also seemed to be friendly and there were times during the duration I saw other smaller white objects around it for less than a second. When I asked if they could change colour they did at the time period of 12-15 min. The object became more circular and changed from bright white to red orange to red then faded out to look like a very dim white star. I did not observe the object after 15 min. I normally do not make reports unless the object is a bit more significant in scale/size/colour/duration; although I see objects usually once a week or more. I also have an extensive military aircraft background and have seen! objects of significance while on missions. Lastly, I want to ! give my sincere thanks to you for providing this service and thankful you are also featured on coast to coast often!",

      "story": "numerous blue white shimmering spheres moving rapidly from northwest to southeast over Albuquerque At approximately 17:40, while driving home along Unser Blvd NW, I observed a bright, but strangely short meteor enter to the northwest.  Impressed by how vivid this fireball was, I shortly put it out of my mind. At around 20:00 I had stepped outside of my westside Albuquerque home to have a cigarette and load items into the car for a weekend trip to Canjilon, NM.  Catching motion out of the corner of my eye, I glanced at the western sky and observed numerous shimmering balls of light crossing rapidly from northwest to southeast.  I promptly ran inside and called for my fiancee to step out as well in order that she could verify what I was observing.  I also retrieved my 60 power spotting scope.  She stepped out with me and we watched in amazement as these objects continued to stream across the sky.  Using my spotting scope, I was able to track one of these objects and was surprised to discover that the scope did not magnify it nearly as much as I would have expected.  I take this to mean that the objects were further away than my initial estimate.  The object I observed with the scope was circular, and while it appeared a bluish white to the naked eye, it seemed to be like a disco ba! ll-shimmering in many different colors.  I put the scope down and continued to observe with the naked eye until all of them had passed.  There was little if any noise from these objects aside from a faint \"muttering\" rumble.  Their movement was erratic and uncoordinated, with some of them traveling faster, and taking wavering paths, but all generally to the southeast.    They traveled very quickly-seemingly three times as fast as I would expect an aircraft to move at the same distance.  They  passed in three groups, with the majority of the objects comprising the lead group-almost reminiscent of the way race cars move about on a track.  I considered taking photographs or video, but considering the apparent size of the objects, their velocity, and the state of darkness at that time of night, video would have been inconclusive and photographs would have been nearly impossible.",

September 22, 2013 UFO Over Albuquerque, NM   This morning at around 0600 my husband and I were walking in a park near our house.  On the way there we noticed a bright, white light in the eastern sky which appeared to be stationary over the mountains.  We thought the light would be gone quickly but it remained in the sky for about 2 hours or more. We called a local radio station to report it and the man who answered said he saw it too this morning but it looked red (most likely due to the sunrise).  He thought it was a planet but it was too large to be Venus or any other planet or star.  It was about one tenth the size of the moon seen in the Western sky. As we watched the object appeared to move higher in the sky but without much lateral motion. When we started our walk we talked to some balloonists who were getting ready to launch and they had been watching it for some time as well and said they didn\u2019t know what it was but suspected it was a weather balloon. There were four balloons that launched in the park and they quickly moved north and out of sight, but the object over the mountains remained where it was without much movement up down or to either side. When we got home we looked at the object with binoculars of 30-50x and it appeared to be spherical, extremely brightly lit (since the sun was behind the mountains and hence behind the object).  It looked like the inside of a led flashlight with little brightly lit circles inside. Many at least three other people at the park saw the light but we did not get their names.  We took a photo with our camera phone which will be e-mailed to you but it was indistinct and showed no detail.",

In Oct, 1984 around 7:30pm while going to parent teacher meeting at Alvarado grade school in north valley of Albuquerque, NM, something very odd was experienced by myself.  Due to not enough parking in front of school I parked in the back side near the play ground.  As I was walking toward the classrooms suddenly there was something hanging in the air.  No sound at all, not sitting on any legs for feet, just hanging there and about 16 ft in diameter.  It was metallic with lights around the bottom in blue, yellow, red, green and purple.  I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing so I walked back toward the car and it disappeared.  Walking toward the classrooms again and there it was once more.  It was as if it was cloaked in some way that unless you were within so many (6) feet of it, it wasn\u2019t there at all.  While standing underneath it I tried to reach up and touch it but it was just high enough that it was out of my reach so about 6 feet high.  The upper part of it had w! hat appeared to be blackened windows. Suddenly a man came out of my daughters classroom walking very fast toward me.  I figured he had just got finished with his teacher meeting and also wondered why he had on sun glasses in the dark. He also had on a black suit, white shirt with thin black tie. I got his attention right away by requesting him to look at this, what is this?  Right away I could tell he was very nervous and asked me, look at what?  I said look at this medal thing just hanging here. He said it\u2019s nothing and I said yes it is something what is it?  He said it\u2019s for advertising.  It flies around advertising. I said to him that no it wasn\u2019t for that at all, there was no sound and no air so it wasn\u2019t a helicopter or airplane and it didn\u2019t have any feet or legs; it was just floating there and we had nothing that would do that.  Again I tried to reach up to touch it and he looked at the window and nodded. What was that about? I had no idea.  Then something happened to me and to this day I don\u2019t know if I went into my meeting with my daughters teacher or not.  Actually I don\u2019t remember at all how I got home, it seems that months and months are still missing from my mind. To this day I feel that this man knew exactly what this was and that he had in fact came in that thing to his meeting. Either this man was an alien himself or someone working with them.  Of course that\u2019s just a very strong feeling I have and also I believe that UFO\u2019s are always there, right in front of us but we can\u2019t see them unless we get within so many feet of them or if by chance light hits them in a certain way.  I know as fact that it was a UFO! I have no doubt about it at all.",

The sighting looks a lot like a star, but when I look through binoculars I can see flashing lights of different colors.  Red, white, blue, yellow.  The twinkling mimics a star but stars shine with much subtler twinkling.  This is the second night that I have seen this.   This UFO is 20 degrees north of west.  I estimate that it is west of Albuquerque and very high in the sky.  It seems to just sit in one spot in the night sky.  The object is about 10 to 15 degrees above the western horizon.  I could be wrong.   Is there a bright star in this location in the morning sky at this time?

Background:  I am an elementary school teacher and I live in Albuquerque.  I have seen unusual objects in the sky before, but primarily in my hometown of Santa Fe.  I am a frequent sky-watcher.  Living near an airport, I am very familiar with objects that are identifiable, like planes and helicopters and how they move and what lights they emit as well as sounds they make traveling overhead. I went out to my backyard to check on my dog.  I looked up as I always do to check out the stars.  I was looking at the east sky when I noticed what looked like a star, a white light, moving slowly straight up in the sky. I then saw a blinking green light positioned vertically under it, also moving up. The lights changed position. They moved from being vertical to being horizontal to the sky line.  When this happened the white light changed color: turned orange-red.  The blinking green light began blinking red then green. The began to move faster, as they picked up speed I could hear what sounded similar to plane noises, but different, almost a rumble.  The sound was loud compared to their distance away from my house.  I am used to hearing plane engine noise as I live near Double Eagle Airport, which is about 10 miles from my house.  Normally when the sound is as loud as I heard it, the planes appear closer to my location. The objects were traveling due west,not Northwest, which is where the airport is located from my house.. As the two objects began to travel west, dogs all over started barking as it flew overhead.  My own dogs were appearing agitated and looking up at the sky. They traveled together; leading was the orange-red light that was not blinking at all, followed by the blinking red and green light. I fixed my eyes on the space between the lights and something seemed fuzzy about the space in between, almost as if there was something being masked in the middle. They begin to travel pretty quick.  I ran inside and then to the front yard which faces west.  I was able to watch them travel west until I could no longer make out the lights.",

We were looking upwards at an airplane in the sky and commenting on the fact that it seemed to be flying low and outside of the normal flight patterns we have seen.   As we were watching the plane, we both witness an object appear to fall from the sky.  The object was much further south than the plane, so we knew it was not at all associated with the plane.   The object was round and reddish-orange and appeared to either be glowing or on fire.  It was about the size of the moon, although it certainly wasn't the moon, which was overhead.   It fell from the clouds towards the ground.  A house across the street obstructed the view so we did not see it land.   The entire process took 3-4 seconds total.

I am guessing the lights were past the airport and had a bright orange/ reddish to them.  Not blinking or strobing but a strong glow to them.  As all were lit the formation was a \"L\"-ish figure up high, with a count of thirteen glowing lights individually synced.  I called my Friend to hurry come look when they finally saw what I did the upper part was not lit and the lower five that were horizontal were.   It lasted for about 15-30 sec. I checked to see if the news or anything was reported the following day and nothing was there I just switched off my phone so I was not able to take a picture but looked up strange lights in the sky on google.

Around 11:00pm on December 3, 2014, I was hanging out with a close friend and his girlfriend at a park on the east side of Albuquerque.  We were walking around the park and heard something that sounded like a mixture between a jet engine and a helicopter.  We all looked up and saw a fairly large, slow moving craft flying pretty low.  We can only describe the craft as a black object with the shape of a sine curve, or something like a pringle chip with upward arches as the wings.   Although the craft blended in with the sky, we could clearly see its shape due to a smooth, bright green, neon light tracing the edges in that exact shape.  The final detail was a large, orange, slow blinking light on the back of it. We were near my house and I was headed home a few minutes after the sighting and I told my mom about it because it had been heading in the direction of our neighbourhood.  She said that a few minutes before I had arrived she heard the exact same sound and that the noise had shaken the whole house.  She described the sound as a plane about to land right above our roof.  I have been doing research since last night on any aircraft with that sort of shape but have found nothing. ((ADDENDA/RESPONSES FROM WITNESS)) #1 Thanks for the quick response!  The only lights were the large orange one and the solid green light tracing the shape of the craft.  I am an art student fortunately, but don't have much experience drawing vehicles.  I will definitely do my best to include an image by this weekend if not tomorrow.  #2 Hello, This is basically what it looked like from our perspective with a neighborhood across the road and the faint outline of the mountains in the background.  It seemed to be less than 1 or 2 miles away and fairly low to the ground considering it shook our house.  Again I believe the craft was black because it blended in to the background but the green and orange lights were what we could see perfectly.  Not sure if it is some sort of military aircraft or anything but I couldn't find any sort of craft with that shape.   Thanks!   #3 Great! That's fine with me.  I don't have really any knowledge of planes or military aircraft but the three of us got a little freaked out and couldn't think of anything it could have been.

Due to cloud cover the when the lights went behind the cloud we lost visibility but the lights didn't reappear out of the clouds instead they reappeared a distance away from the cloud and suddenly. Tomorrow we will be watching again and hopefully I can capture video.",

They were spotted at 7:45 pm and were present for about 20 minutes.  They came from the south and headed northwesterly. They merged together at certain points, and seemed to just blend away into the night sky opposed to speeding up and flying away. We were able to get video footage, and noticed the distinct sounds of moving water and insects upon viewing, however, we were in Albuquerque proper where neither of those things were present.  I believe the sounds were emanating from the ships. I've been witness to quite a few sighting over the years, but never one so blatant. How no one else took notice, i don't know, but they were definitely noticeable, and not of this world.  That I know. I'd also like to mention that out of all the sightings I've been witness too, this is the first one where I had no sense of euphoria during or afterwards, was not compelled in anyway, and my phone didn't die or shut off, which is why I was able to obtain footage.",

      "story": "Skip/hop/dipping flying craft.  Reflective and bright white to completely clear (invisible). Saturday, May 30th, 2015,  \tJust to start off\u2026  It was a warm day with a clear blue sky.  I was sitting facing somewhat South?  The object was moving South-West. \tI went out to the backyard to have a smoke on the porch.  After lighting my cigarette, I was just looking out over the street and saw what I first thought was a strip of cloth floating down across the street.  After a few seconds of examination, as it was falling slowly (swaying), its appearance was as such; really large, thin, kinda flimsy, kinda heavy, almost belt shaped, yellowish clear with burn marks on it, mica mineral-esque, kind of metallic?  But with cloth like properties.   Anyhow, I watched as it drifted downwards across the street and over the house next door.  My first thought was, \u201cthat was weird,\u201d and then I began thinking, \u201cWhere the hell could that have come from anyway?  Where could that have fallen from?\u201d  I considered the angle, and it appeared to be falling in a way that it was much too heavy to have been picked up by the wind at all (there was only a slight breeze), as it was just drifting downwards.  My next thought was, \u201cwell whatever, that is just weird.\u201d \t  I then started looking at the clouds, a few seconds after seeing the weird metallic/mica/cloth/burnt thing.  Immediately catching my eye was an incredible bright object a ways off in the sky overhead.  My first thought was, \u201cwow that\u2019s a shiny plane.\u201d  hah But it wasn\u2019t shaped like a plane, and it immediately stopping reflecting light.  I thought I lost sight of it, but then it suddenly got extremely bright again.  To compare it to something, I\u2019d have to say it was like just the bright spot on a mirror where it\u2019s reflecting concentrated rays of light.  I didn\u2019t think it was weird, as I thought it may just be a plane catching light at a certain angle while spinning or something.   Then as it continued forward (still suddenly really brightly reflecting then not being visible), I realized it wasn\u2019t flying like a plane should fly either; it was kind of dipping down and then back up, and then down, and back up, in the same pattern (you know how they animate planes in cartoons that suddenly run out of gas and putter down and back up; kind of like that), but it was more skipping like a stone across the water.   So, now my brain is processing seeing a strange flying object that suddenly gets really bright and then invisible while skip-flying. It wasn\u2019t like a plane diving down and back up. It was more like a wave riding, hopping motion.  Anyway, I immediately decided, \u201cthat can\u2019t possibly be a plane, because it doesn\u2019t look like a plane (doesn\u2019t have much shape at all); it\u2019s not spinning or twisting at all or doing anything in any way to reflect light so intensely in that very consistent pattern\u2026\u201d It couldn\u2019t have been a balloon either, as there was no wind and it was moving quickly and everything else I have and will describe.  A balloon could not ascend and descend that quickly either, especially in that consistent pattern.   Its hopping/skipping/dipping pattern made me think of that of an extremely large bird with an extremely large wingspan; the way that the b! ody of the bird would dip as it thrusts its wings up and then ! down, but a slightly extended duration at great speed.  For a split second, I thought it might even be a really large bird, because of that, but it obviously was not a bird.  Birds do not shimmer, or turn invisible, or flap without wings, and they aren\u2019t larger than planes, and aren\u2019t shaped like weird squashed oval triangles.  It did not have wings or any specific shape.  The object also made no noise at all, and it didn\u2019t leave any contrails, despite its speed.  I forgot to mention that the craft had no lights on it, other than the reflected bright white, and it wasn\u2019t any other color but clear and bright white light.  It didn\u2019t have any appendages or anything either. The object wasn\u2019t aflame or anything.  It was just really extremely bright white reflected light. After blinking my eyes a couple times for a second something odd happened.  The object was apparently so bright that when closing my eyes it created the spot that you get after looking directly at a bright light (even though it had only been a few seconds).  This gave me a good idea of the shape of the \u201ccraft\u201d I suppose.  It was like a stretched oval, kind of like a squashed very rounded obtuse triangle.  The shape was hard to discern as it became so bright. The surface appeared pure white, which is I\u2019m guessing because of the crafts reflective properties. I have no idea.  I watched this skipping bright then invisible object for a couple minutes until it got to a good distance away. It was moving much faster than a plane at the height that it appeared to be. Another thought I had while I thought it might be a plane, before I noticed everything about it, was that it wasn\u2019t heading down! . The first couple of skip/dips I thought might be plausible for a plane in turbulence that was suddenly damaged (though the sky was clear and no wind), but the pattern was exactly the same every time and the vanishing + reflecting really bright without spinning obviously made it clear that it wasn\u2019t a plane. There was also no smoke or anything. It didn\u2019t have a plane shape, and it was a consistently skipping/dipping really bright then invisible non-descending object. I\u2019m super guessing that it was maybe about 2-5 miles up in the air. This was so astoundingly different and unexplainable that I actually wanted to report it on the national UFO sighting website. It happened. I saw it. Something presumably fell off of it and landed a few houses away (which there is no way I\u2019m going to knock on my neighbors door down the way and ask if they have the weird metallic mica mineral like material that fell near their house). Afterwards, as I snuffed my cigarette out in the dirt, I jus! t thought, \u201cWhatever, like the other random weird things peopl! e see in the sky; I\u2019ll just ignore it and go about my day. Unexplained stuff happens sometimes and I\u2019m not going to jump to conclusions or get all tin foil hat about it.\u201d Anyway, I thought it was over, I was just going to ignore it and whatever. I went back inside and got on my desktop computer. After about 15 minutes\u2026.. Something happened. A loud BOOF shockwave like sonic boom sound and the house rattled. The power immediately went off. The pressure and the sound came from the direction that the unidentified skip/hop-flying bright then invisible thing was going. The power went out everywhere. 5 minutes after that there was another smaller pressure wave sound sonic boom-like thing from the same direction. It didn\u2019t sound like an explosion. Both sounded like\u2026. I don\u2019t know.... BUFF or BOOF? Haha Like a massive highly pressurized air pocket the size of a few football fields burst a few miles away? It\u2019s hard to explain. Some of these details may sound like a hot air balloon, but in no way could a hot air balloon do exactly what I saw, or be made of the material that came from it, or create the massive BOOF (that\u2019s what I\u2019m calling it now) and sh! ockwave that turns off electrical devices.  Everyone was outside asking one another if their power went out and whether they saw anything.  Everyone was looking around for smoke and checking all the transformers. None of them had blown. After about another 8-15 minutes, the power came back on of its own volition. The outage was reported to the local electric company and I checked their outage map. A couple thousand reported people in this area of the city were affected and a few stretching outwards from the direction of the BOOF. There were more concentrated outages closer to the direction of the wave. There aren\u2019t any large transformers that power everyone around here in that direction that I know of. This was written within a few hours of them happening. The events transpired at some time between 3:20 pm and 5:50 pm. It is now 9:31 pm. The electricity company reports that the cause of the outage is unknown and still under investigation. All these unexplained concurrent events could just be highly unlikely coincidences. Murphy\u2019s law, so whatever I guess? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

I\u2019m so very angry in addition to my mortification.  I had asked him early on if he was using an app but he didn\u2019t respond.  He was at work so I thought he was busy.  Sometime in the middle of the day he sent me another photo.  Later in the afternoon, I had the chance to look at it and I think it is after your call telling me you said it was most likely an overlay, and found it was strange both pictures had the \u201cUFO\u201d at the same angle and the same amount of the vehicle was showing.  Later even I looked at the third photo and it was the same as the others.  When I picked up my son, he admitted his \u201cjoke\u201d.     My son has no idea how this affected me.  He doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019ve seen and wouldn\u2019t believe me if he did.  Actually, I wouldn\u2019t either if I hadn\u2019t been with a person who was not connected to me in any way.  I\u2019m not afraid, sir, I\u2019m respectful of the information and implications.  These are real events that deserve careful research and consideration.  Now I hope you understand a little better the gravity of my apology.   My son and I will have a conversation when I\u2019m ready.  But I still owe you, Mr. Davenport.   Regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))",

As it was directly overhead the shape of the object seemed to change rapidly...  As if it was amorphous and constantly fluctuating somehow - the closest thing I can compare it to is a hot air balloon inflating on the ground, but I've never seen a balloon do this motion in the air.  Eventually it drifted over Kirtland AFB and disintegrated into many small orbs which feel to the ground, and the light of the fire disappeared. The body of the craft was morphing rapidly,as if the structure was a plasma contained in a dark bag. also, hot air balloons are usually very loud when they blast their heaters...this craft made zero noise.  Dogs nearby barked when it was overhead as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "2 adjacent yellow orange lights with large space between move across sky before vanishing CLEARLY VISIBLE! Albuquerque NM I-25 Southbound 7:00pm (Sharp) Mountain Time 1/13/16.\t   Heading south on the freeway I saw two adjacent lights flying west directly ahead in my line of sight while driving.  The lights did not blink and seemed to be part of the same craft though no actual body of the craft was visible only two round lights travelling together at the same speed no sound.  Within a matter of seconds the lights dimmed out of sight and for the remainder of my 15-minute drive along the freeway where I have a open view of the sky, the lights did not reappear. Approximately two years ago I had an encounter with a UFO while driving with two friends maybe around 8:00pm.  Two adjacent lights dim yellow-orange, hovering somewhat close to the ground in an area with absolutely no tall buildings.  They were solid in color and did not blink such as a plane does. As we turned the car back to get a better look they had vanished. Further Description:   \tLights seemed to be about the height of a helicopter \u2022\tTraveled short distance before disappearing \u2022\tTraveled in straight line \u2022\tFaster than a helicopter \u2022\tYellow orange, resembled the brightness of a plane in the distance \u2022\tDID NOT BLINK AT ALL!! Which I assume violates FAA regulations \u2022\tSeveral blinking aircraft in the vicinity \u2022\tSpace between lights must have been massive, larger than a blimp  As the lights dimmed out of sight I would compare it to a falling star as it dies smoothly fading out of sight. The lights must have been attached to the same craft that was not visible or hidden by the night. The space between the lights could\u2019ve held a blimp between them but traveled too fast. Distance from UFO was not clear since no actual body was visible. Either way the space between the lights is unexplainable, much too large for any aircraft of my knowledge. The lights were so clear from the freeway, many others must have seen. Background: 20-year-old college student, male, and understands very clearly what planes, helicopters, blimps, satellites, meteors, and weather balloons look like.",

What is that?!\"    So i ran twards the back where she was and saw a giant triangular shaped object that was dark gray and was moving pretty quick and maneuvering in ways that  an airplane couldn't and with absolutely no sound.  We live in a neighborhood that is in line with the airport runway, so lights being on on a aircraft is highly required and this object was stealth.  No lights at all!!

The craft was dark grey, triangle shape with no visible lights, markings of any kind, or landing gear, and made absolutely no noise as it passed over. I live in a glide path for commercial airlines, south to north, and see planes every day.  They make noise.  They have smooth body fuselage and wings.  This craft was not a plane.  It was more triangular in shape, and it was not smooth underneath like planes are.  It was very nodular.  I\u2019ve been looking at photos online to see if there is anything like what I saw posted, but can\u2019t find anything in real life.  Closest thing was the Millennium Falcon from Starwars. I am retired, 67 year old male, with good vision and sound mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It was the shape of an elongated cigar positioned vertically.  It did not move or fade off as a vapor trail would.  A bright object was positioned a good deal north of the UFO, possibly Saturn.  Not long past sunset, the backdrop was a light pearly grey.  The object was roughly parallel on the horizon with the planet.  When I put my glasses on for greater detail, I could tell this was a specific, contained shape. On my drive home headed southbound, I could no longer see the pink UFO.  It had disappeared.  I know it was gone because the bright \"planet\" used as a reference point remained, but the UFO did not.  Even with the silhouette of trees, I should have seen this bright pink object.  It was not that low in the sky.  Once home, I went online to see if anyone had reported weather balloons over Albuquerque that night; there were no such reports.",

I was gazing up at the night sky during a relatively clear night, with only a few broken clouds north of the city.   I noticed a jet airplane flying west, directly over Albuquerque, with blinking lights clearly visible.  As I followed the path of the jet, my eye was drawn to another object in the night sky moving from WSW to ENE.  It was a steady bright red, about the size of the planet Mars. I knew it was not a jet, or a helicopter, because it had no blinking lights.   At first, I thought perhaps it might be a satellite, but then I realized it was moving faster than a satellite and was too bright.  The intensity of the light seemed to brighten and then dim.   I mentioned the light to my friend, and as he found it in the sky, the light made a sudden 90 degree turn to the north, and then faded completely out in just a matter of 2 or 3 seconds.",

It was lower in the atmosphere as a plane would be that was close to a landing strip.  This was definitely not an airplane or other known aircraft.

It looked like there was a huge object that was hovering around Venus, sometimes blocking it from view.  I could see the outline of a huge oval gem or a marquis diamond which almost appeared opaque or camouflaged, like it blended in with the sky behind it...it's hard to explain.  It was also shimmering blue, purple, green, and red around the edges.  The flight pattern was like nothing I've ever seen...it was not human.  It slowly hovered and swayed in the same spot for about 20 minutes when the object split into a smaller flashing red light that shot off into the sky. So fast.  I've never seen anything like it.  I probably asked my mom 10 times if she was seeing what I was (she's an even bigger skeptic than I, but she confirmed that she saw it and it was \"weird.\").  The objects hovered around each other for a few moments then the little one just...shot off.  Straight out and into space.  The larger object hovered for another ten minutes or so before it faded and disappeared.  I haven't seen it since, but every night when I go out to smoke, I'm always looking above the mountains in the hope of seeing it again.  Blew my mind.

It was shaped like a street lamp or as if the moon were elongated. Kept eye on it wondering what it was, but not thinking it was anything out of the ordinary.  After about 5 seconds, it suddenly disappeared.  Shocked, I started running to friend's building to tell her what I had seen.  She came running up to me asking me if I had seen it.

I was standing outside getting ready to ring a bell as is my New Year's tradition when I spotted three glowing red-orange dots. They were low to the NE, rising slowly and steadily up southwards. The top two made a sharp curve west and faded out. By the time the third, flickering slightly, slowly faded from view, 5 or 6 more in a loose constellation followed it in the same direction, disappearing one by one. A very bright one appeared afterwards, taking the same curved route as the first two. It took nearly 10 minutes for the whole spectacle to play out.  I'm not sure of the exact number because once I realized they were not helicopters, I was busy trying to get a picture. Afterwards, I thought they might have been fire balloons -- until I saw the one photo that came out.  Those wild orange swirls are the motions of the orange dots within the second it took to snap the photo. They are NOT the result of camera motion because 1) they are not at all the same, and 2) that bright green squiggle in the lower left is a string of Christmas tree lights across the street, and it's absolutely unblurred and crisp.  I've enhanced color and contrast to make the trails more visible but that's all.  The interesting thing is that my first UFO sighting was also of three glowing orbs and happened exactly two years to the minute on New Years 2016 -- which is why I had the camera ready, though I never expected to see them again.",

It is the same light I sighted and reported to both NUFORC and MUFON on 10/24/17.  It was again changing colors (red, blue, green, & white) while hovering stationary SSE of my location, not making any sound, and at an altitude about the same as that of a commercial airliner. I go out to my car almost every night around 12:00 AM to 1:00 AM to remove my radar detector from my car so it doesn't get stolen, and I have looked every time I go out there since my previous report on 10/24/17 to see if this light was there.  Up until this sighting, I have not seen it since 10/24, and there have been no clouds to obscure it if it had been there between 10/24 and 11/12. After my report to MUFON about the 10/24 sighting, I received an email from their investigator informing me there were no visible stars, planets, or other celestial bodies in the sky SE of Albuquerque where the object I saw was located; the person informed me there is a visible star NE of my location, but not SE.  This light looks to be too low to be a celestial body yet too high to be a helicopter or some other such aircraft, and since it is hovering in the same place for an extended period of time, it cannot be a fixed wing aircraft. I observed this light for 20 to 30 minutes before going back inside.  I first saw the object at 1:00 AM and went back inside sometime after 1:20 AM.  I took several minutes of video of the light.  https://youtu.be/kWj03TRNYTc ((NUFORC Note:  In a follow-up telephone conversation with the witness, he confirmed that the object he witnessed was Sirius.

It was mostly white but was red at one end.  It hovered for several seconds.   Then, in about a 1/4 second, it flew east across the mountains and disappeared out of sight.

I was driving north on I-25 a few miles south of the Sunport exit.  All of a sudden, this object fell out of the sky in front of me to my left.  It came diagonally across the highway at fairly close range.  I was driving past a collection of large white oil storage (?) facilities that were on the left.  The object seemed to fall between the highway and those tanks. It was hard to judge size but perhaps two fists in size might be a good guess.  It appeared to be shiny metallic but was not on fire or glowing in any way.  Made me wonder if a piece had fallen off a jet flying in that area.

At 7:08 AM on April 4, 2018, while heading directly Westbound on Spain Road at the intersection of Spain Road and Eubank Blvd NE in Albuquerque, NM, I noticed a large, rust-colored saucer in the sky.   The saucer looked to be moving extremely slowly towards the North or Northwest approximately 2,000 Ft above the Albuquerque valley and approximately 4 miles West from my location.  At first, I put it off as an odd colored military aircraft taking off the same direction I was going, but the sky around the saucer became a lighter blue color in a perfect geometrical shape of a parallelogram.  I thought my eyes were playing a trick on me, and I looked forward to continue driving through the intersection.  I looked back up to verify what I saw, and the saucer was gone.   From the vantage point of where I was, I could see the entire sky, and no object was visible anywhere anymore.   I am a veteran of who has worked on airfields with every type of US military plane, and every aspect of this object was not consistent with any military aircraft I have seen, so here I am reporting this because I cannot verify what this UFO was even with my knowledge.

It was blinking, still hovering, and appeared to be changing shape.  It was not a helicopter, airplane, or balloon.  That was obvious since a helicopter was circling around  near I-40 in the south west distance.  I don\u2019t know Albuquerque very well, so I was turning left and right all over trying to get closer.  I ended up on Indian School and parked in a church parking lot.  My crappy phone camera still couldn\u2019t see what I was plainly seeing at that point.  It was a very odd shape.  If you have Microsoft Word (version 2007), go to insert a shape and under stars and banners the fist couple shapes is what I saw.  I don't know how else to describe this.  It was red and blinking\u2026or maybe shimmering.  It seemed to be changing colors a bit. It was so strange.  Just hovering, not moving.  Others pulled over in the church parking lot.  I know they saw what I saw because we were parked all horizontal in the lot just staring at the sky.  I tried again to take a photo\u2026so frustrating\u2026nothing.  Looked like a speck of dust on my phone even though what I was looking at was large.  I decided to drive further and try to get even closer.  In doing so, I must have ended up under it because I lost it.  I watched this object for a total of 20 minutes while I drove.  It was broad daylight, sun shining, so I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing.  I seriously hope someone got a photo of it.

Let me start off by saying I am a firm believer that there is some weird ((deleted--stuff)) going on call it aliens or whatever but I'm a 19 year old native of Albuquerque, New Mexico, so I have heard the UFO stories of Roswell and other UFO stories that birth from New Mexico, but this one I was able to experience first-hand and up close. this was the scariest thing i have experienced but it has left me wondering if anyone else witnessed this. At about 11:00 p.m through 12:00 a.m February 19, 2019, (Just Last night) in Albuquerque I noticed a formation of three dots starting on the Northwest side of our Mountains (Sandia Mountains).  As I stared closer these dots were actually moving simultaneously south going along the base of the mountains.  These lights were the brightest lights in the city so I thought maybe a search party along the mountains or something with a logical explanation but the longer I stared the more intrigued I became at how they were just able to float and connect to each other in synchronicity, so I got in my truck and drove up Paseo Del Norte eastbound towards the Sandias where the lights were floating and slowly moving.  As I got closer to the lights they became almost mesmerizing and bear with me but seemed like an acid trip or some sort of hallucinogenic matrix within those light formations but the even weirder part is once I was at the street, Louisiana, still going up Paseo, it started to smell so foul almost like rotten eggs or rotting bodies, this was a clear indicator that whatever was up on those mountains was creating some sort of disgusting gas or odor which made me almost delusional and confused.  I immediately turned around and went home to get my brother so I could have a witness.  (My iPhone 6s could not pick up ((deleted--stuff)) on the camera).   After picking up my brother from the west-side of town, we drove to a small hill that overlooks the city and fair enough the lights were there and moving pretty close to were the Sandia Casino is and at that point I had enough and went home. There is a YouTube video:  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEHxfKn6dVo&list=LLp59OiX9hU9cvilK9Ckf3bw&t=0s&index=3)  The video shows 2 lights that are exactly like one of the many bright lights I saw last night. I'm glad I found this video since I was not able to get a video or a picture of the actual event.  Another statement to add was that these lights started on the north side of the bas! e of the mountain and 'floated' to the south side of the base of that mountain in such a strange manner, almost like the way programs can stack on top of each other on a computer.  Like if there is a virus spamming a bunch of programs on a computer.  It may be smart to add that there is a military base on the south side area where the UFO's were floating to (Kirtland Air-force Base, Manzano Base)",

It flew towards the Air Force base but didn\u2019t appear to land there.  It just flew off towards the mountains.  It was amazing,! actually.  We were not terrified, my witness and I were actually very excited.  I told my witness, if you watch the skies you can always pick an anomoly at least once or twice a year.  It was very disconcerting that it was so close above the airport, and nobody was able see it.  Maybe they did I don\u2019t know.  None the less amazing.  We were standing near the grassy area north of the Sunport.  It\u2019s the road all the taxis wait for flight arrivals by airport near the hotel and vacant lot at the end of the cul de sac. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

October 9, 2019  This morning I was driving to an appointment I had at the VA Hospital in Albuquerque, NM.  My wife and I moved to Albuquerque late last year.  I saw a stationary, very, very bright white light above the Sandia Mountain range at approximately 6:45AM.  It was difficult to look directly at the light.  When I saw the light I was traveling east on the Paseo del Norte (an east west four lane highway).  The light lasted just a few seconds before it \"winked\" out.  I didn't see a tail that one would see if it were a meteor.  I can't say if the light was above the mountain range or east of the range.  At whatever distance it was at it appeared to be the size of a pin head.  I don't know if it was a UFO.   Currently, Albuquerque is celebrating the annual Balloon Fiesta.  The fiesta started last weekend and ends this weekend.  There were balloons in the sky but they were all above the Balloon Park or spread out to the north.  It was no more than 5-15 minutes after the light went out that I saw a helicopter flying south towards the general location of the light.  The helicopter may have turned east, but the distance was too far for me to be sure if it went east or turned west.  By then I was merging onto Interstate 25 going south to the VA hospital.  One thought that occurred to me at the time was that the light I observed was a star becoming a super nova.  A second thought was that it may have been an airplane coming in to land at the Albuquerque airport.  I scratched that idea by the way the light disappeared and its high intensity.  By the way, there were no stars to be seen in this part of the sky as the sun was up on the other side of the mountain range.  I'm sure other people driving east would have seen the same light.  There were hundreds of cars on the road heading to work or the balloon park.",

I saw that it was not flat bottom, round or triangular but a very unusual shape with obvious edges and seemingly solid and unusual because I realized that it was emanating its own light and not being lit from light reflected from the ground.  Might have been from the heat of its speed through the atmosphere.  It emitted no sound nor had any lights.
