      "story": "Fiery circular craft spotted hovering in Jersey City and then vanishes After watching the latest Spiderman movie with my family at Newport Center Mall in Jersey City we headed home.  After leaving the mall garage, we cut through the BJ\u2019s shopping center area and my wife (seated in the passenger seat) says, \u201cWhat is that in the sky?\u201d.  A few seconds after, my cousin seated behind my wife saw it too.  Since it was visible on the right side and I was driving I couldn\u2019t see it initially.  Then I opened the moonroof of my truck and I was finally able to see it.  Shortly after my son saw it as well. It looked like a large circular fireball hovering over a distant city somewhere west of us in NJ.  It was about as high as a plane would be flying.  The appearance of the ball seemed like a glowing orange fiery light and it seemed like it had some type of aura.  My wife\u2019s first thought was that it was a plane on fire.  But after watching the object for about 30 seconds that claim was quickly refuted.  I asked if someone could take out their phone to! record it.  My son immediately began to reach for his phone and as he started reaching for it to the second this bright orange object began to move North in a linear fashion.  As it started to move this bright orange light that lit up the night sky began to diminish in a matter of seconds until it was completely dim and vanished out of sight.  It\u2019s almost as though it knew we were about to record it.",

      "story": "Worm shaped object seen by at least 6 adults from Jersey City back yards I was with two other people (all adults) in the back yard in the evening, right around dusk. There were 3 adults and 2 children in the adjacent yard. We all saw a silent, dark gray object in the sky, it looked like it was a few miles away, just above the tree line. It was worm shaped, it looked kind of like a para-sail. It seemed to have three sections that were fairly straight, but combined together to make a shallow downward facing C shape - the open part of the C facing the ground. At first I thought it was a balloon or a kite, but it didn't behave like either. I ran into the house to find a camera, when I returned, it had moved to a new position, and had become much fainter. I watched it gradually, over a period of 2 - 3 minutes, grow fainter and fainter, until it vanished. It was also growing darker at the same time. It may have simply vanished into some clouds, but it was starting to grow dark outside, so it was hard to tell if there were clouds that it could have disappeared into.  I took a picture with my cell phone camera-you can see something there, but it just looks like a blurry smudge. I took some pics with a digital camera, but unfortunately, i couldn't figure out how to turn the flash off. I also took some video with the digital camera, but by that time, the object had grown very faint, and it was growing dark outside.  We did see and hear an aircraft approach the same area at great speed. I was unable to tell what kind of aircraft it might be, but it sounded like a military jet.",

Posted 03/21/08 Not long ago looking through photos taking on the second of September 2007 during the on-board cruise around the Manhattan I discovered a few strange pictures.  I have found on these pictures an object which presence I can not interpret unambiguously.  This strange object in the shape of \u201cflying saucer or disk--can be seen against a background of clear blue sky of Jersey City (NJ).  The exact time of this phenomenon (12 hours 25 minutes PM) has been fixed on the big clock of Jersey City presented on the photo.  On the attached photo as well as on the other photos I have can be seen also the reflection of the above-mentioned strange object on the tall building of Jersey City.

A 747 jet was coming over the sky line & near it a slightly lite blurry small area of the sky. Three orbs of light came through whatever the liter area of the clouds were & proceeded to literally \"do laps\" around the 747. It was akin to a swarm of flys in the sense each has its own free movement but follows with the swarms general movement. So these things lapped(seemed to be playing with it). It was an amazing experience! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))",

My girlfriend and I just walked out side to have a cigarette on the roof deck of our apartment which is about eight floors in the air and faces the statue of liberty.  Our apartment consists of two towers and the roof deck conneects them.  We are exactly one block away from the Hudson River so we are very close, and the sky was completely clear of clouds.  There were only other planes and a few stars in the sky. We sat down lit our cigarette when a singular light similar to a plane appeared and flashed across a specifc section of the sky in a downwards arc at an incredible speed of the likes I've never seen before.  Judging by the speed and trajectory this could not have been anything like a shoot star.  Also, because of the fact the light just went on then all of a sudden went off-not out of sight although we couldn't see it anymore-I do not think it was anything man made. I have never been on a UFO site before nor have I have had a sighting.  I do not know anything else that this could be.",

      "story": "Very fast green hazy fireball over jersey city NJ My lady and I were watching television this evening.  Our sofa faces the west window exposure in our loft.  It was around 9:40 p.m. when I jumped off the couch yelling \"what the he'll is that?!?\"  My lady looked and couldn't believe it either.  What we had seen was a green fireball like object jet across the window exposure wickedly fast.  There was a small trail behind it but quickly dissipated.  The fireball then vanished into the sky while moving south west.  What's interesting is that I've seen this green fireball twice before in a property we lived in just one block east from where we currently reside in 2004.  It was seen traveling in the same south west direction.  My lady didn't necessarily believe me until this evening.  I can say what we saw this evening lasted roughly 12-15 seconds.  In our prior living space we had north west exposures so I know it had come from that direction.  Tonight It just appeared west and travelled south west.  She and I thought maybe fireworks initially but there are no structures surrounding to allow a launch in that direction especially being it moved horizontally.   I have an iron clad memory and know without a shadow of doubt this IS the same gree fireball light I've seen twice in 2004.",

We saw three orange glows in the sky.  At first, I thought it must be the sun or moon, but they were clearly distinct shapes and they were moving kind of toward the left and downward until they finally disappeared behind the houses in the distance.  I would say they were not some kind of optical illusion, nor did they appear to be some kind of reflection caused by the sun.  They were definitely not airplanes. We then did some looking around online to see if anyone else had reported any similar sightings, and we found that there have been many reports in the last few years (one in my home town in Huntingdon, England) and others more locally.  Finally, we came across this website and decided to add our voice to the many others who say they have seen something.  I wouldn't like to say it was definitely something from outer space! Big claims require big evidence (or something like that) as someone once said. But they were definitely UFOs.",
