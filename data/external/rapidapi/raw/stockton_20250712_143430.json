You have performed an invaluable service for a countless number of people who are fascinated by the subject of your work.  I have been increasingly disturbed by the number of negative comments that you have received regarding the \"timeliness\" of your postings.   For any of your readers who might feel compelled to complain, let me say to them \"don\u2019t do it.\"  The data that you compile and disseminate is of such importance that I am fearful that too much of those uninformed comments will cause you to throw in the towel and give it up.  To those who might wish to complain, please know that this effort is made for your benefit and entertainment on truly \"shoestring resources\" (both financial and manpower).  To my knowledge, Mr. Davenport receives no compensation at all for devoting his life to this cause.  Before you file a complaint, think about the effort that must go into receiving, reading, cataloging, and posting the 400+ reports that I\u2019m sure he receives every month.  If you still feel justified in complaining, don\u2019t bother checking the site.  Peter, thanks for all you do.

      "story": "Witnessed numerous UFO's along I-5 from Stockton south to Tehachipi on busy holiday weekend. This event took place in 1973. I was 21 years old and traveled from San Diego County to Portland Ore with my brother and his wife on 4th of July weekend.   My brother was in army aviation at the time and I was a student pilot.  Another brother was an air controller for the SAC, a close cousin an army pilot and his brother an Air Force kicker.  We grew up adjacent to air bases: Kirkland, Biggs, Mira Mar and Camp Pendleton. We are very familiar with aircraft and their abilities.  On the return trip from Portland we were at the cloverleaf of I-5 and I-580 in the Stockton California area at dusk. (perhaps 8PM). The freeways were very busy. My brother and I saw a craft coming from our 10 o'clock position very low. Our first assumption was that it was a crop duster as they are common in that vicinity and they prefer to work right up to sunset. The craft had three lights, red, green and amber, not unlike any aircraft except that they were in the wrong positions and the anti-collision lamp did not blink.  The craft came in right over our windshield at about 60 -100 ft AGL!  We looked directly up at it but only saw a blur. It appeared to be transparent. It past over us to our 2 o'clock position and only about 300 ft lateral and 100 ft altitude. I got a good look at it. It was tubular with a simple frame for a fuselage. The craft was transparent as if made from see through covering. It had short stubs protruding from its sides that were not sufficient to be wings or airfoils. It had no engines.  It immediately, without turning, returned in our direction while descending.  An impossible maneuver for any aircraft that I know of. It's speed was slow, perhaps 45mph. The stubs turned out to have bright lamps attached and they were activated nearly blinding us. The craft flew down to the deck illuminating the field of wheat (or rice) and pushing it aside as it moved a few feet above it. I again got a close look and the craft was not a duster or helicopter. I have never known dusters to use lights as dusting is too dangerous at night.  We looked at other motorists at they seemed not to notice. We followed the progress of the crafts as it continued to crisscrossed I-5 in a similar fashion as we moved south at about 80 mph. Complete darkness fell swiftly. We then saw many craft with two lights performing the same maneuvers amongst the fields. They were acting as if they were looking for something on the ground by \"strafing\" it with their lights which were too close together to be mistaken as autos in the distance. We also noticed that at times they would stop and hover over the California Aqueduct and shine their beams downward. We stopped several times to witness the events. Though many times the hovering objects were close they made no sound.  Again other motorists seemed to notice nothing. There were usually three in sight at all times. We tried to rationalize that it was helicopters, agricultural machinery or autos in the distance. However, in the following years i made that same trip many times at night and never saw anything like it again. Our only rational thought was that it was police looking for someone. We listened to the radio in ernest hoping for a news announcement. Of course there was none. The object(s) began following us at fence top level along the opposite side of the freeway, about 100 yards behind. We tested them several times by speeding up to 140 mph and then slowing to about 20mph. The craft(s) kept pace with us! When they seemed to be bored with this game they would fly off laterally at high speed but still stay within sight. Often they would be replaced by another in their former position.  After the initial first sighting near Stockton, my sister-in-law fell asleep in the back seat. We attempted several times over the next few hours to awake her to witness the show but were unable to. She was clearly alive but slapping and shaking could not wake her.  We were totally confused and decided to stop in at a truck stop a few miles off the freeway near the bottom of the Grapevine. We had witnessed this phenomenon for about three hours at this point. We made casual inquiries in the restaurant of the staff and truckers but no one saw anything. My sister-in-law remained unconscious. We continued on our trip south and had no more sightings.  Upon awaking the next day my brother and I went over what had transpired. We discovered that we were missing somewhere between 90 and 180 minutes of time. We checked our gas receipts which were dated and time stamped and new our speed averaged 80 mph except for the few times we stopped which we accounted for. We had no sensation that we were abducted then or since and suffered no ill effects.  Many years later I read a book by a UFO investigator that stated that 1973 was a big \"flap\" year in California and the Central Valley in general.",

It was coming down lower and lower and closer to the car lower than the 3 story Pac Bell building on March Lane.  It seemed as wide as the goodyear  blimp.  I was cutting behind the building to get to the aparment complex next door.  I rolled down the window to hear a motor and it was completely silent.  That was when i got scared.  The car almost stalled.  At that point I panicked and prayed to God that we not get taken up as I have heard that happens to people.  I checked my clock to make sure no time would had been lost.  I took my adult friend and her 2 children home (in the complex) and then raced back home.  When I got home I went to my backyard and could see it in a distance moving toward UOP.  I was also shocked at the boldness of it moving so slowly and so low.  My back yard was on Brookside Road at the levy.  I watched my clock and arrived home without losing any time.  I was stunned to the point of not seeming able to speak about it and my friend was as well.    A couple of years later I brought it up and asked her and her children exactly what they saw and it was the same.  Just recently I have felt able to tell others.   I still cannot even believe we saw it and I really do believe  that had I not prayed we would have been taken up.  I am now a 55 year old woman and at the time was managing properties in Stockton for a developer out of Roseville.  I had been with them for close to 3 years.  I am a professional woman and at that time my children were enrolled in private school.  My friend was in her late 20's at the time and  the  children were 10 and 8 years old.  Neither of us used drugs or alchohol.  Needless to say it was very frightening and I still look over my shoulder in  fear.  When I was about 6 years old I had seen a saucer very low moving fast across the horizon in Bay City, Michigan.",

My Brother and a group of four friends were walking back to our house about four or five blocks away following a large craft that went from being glowing bright light to turning off the light, by that time they had arrived at my moms place were they startled us out of my house with screams of bloody murder, me and my youngest brother ran out to a black craft that lit up with three large orangeish red lights one light on each end of the triangle shaped craft. The completely,silent object had absolutely no sound and was so low to the ground that I felt as though I could throw a rock at it. I won't forget seeing the orangeish red lights come on one at a time it was so scary they were giant I had two brothers and three family friends that saw it and were so scared they won't even talk about it. Oh and when I came outside they were screaming about something falling out of the back of it. I watched it and followed it as it went off into the distance. I lived in the middle of a densely populated city of Stockton I can't believe no one reported it to the media I was only seventeen at the time and was pretty shook up and scared they were coming back. Oh and Hail-Bop comet was visible in the sky at that time which was scary enough to look at. I will try and have one of the others come forth and tell their story about that night in 1997 they may have a better way of explaining what they saw. Thank you very much for this opportunity to tell my story.",

Married for 8+ years with a stable happy life. Ironically, we had just moved back to the Stockton address (my home growing up)nearly three years previous in December 1984 from Roswell, N.M.. We moved to Roswell by chance. Placed an application at the local sign company while I helped a couple good friends move to Roswell. Not Once did any of my super good partners who were born and raised in Roswell mention/utter a word about the Roswell Incident 40 years earlier. Anyway--- at that time and probably ever sense I was in my late teens I've always had the attitude that \"anything is possible\". I can only say for sure that the date an year can only be 1987 or 1988 in early to mid November. Why I remember that it was in November, we were having an \"Indian Summer\" that year. I was watering the edges of my front lawn by hand when for no reason I looked up into the sky above me and all I could see is a black. No stars, no blue-black color that one see's normally as the color of night sky unless you live away from city lights etc.The whole entire sky was filled with this huge black opaque object as far as I could see in all directions. Then through the branches of the tree that I was standing under,set of lights appeared in a chevron shape with a larger reddish orange with a glimpse of yellow lite was in the center of this chevron shape of different colored lights. It was so huge and looked as though it was traveling no more than 30-40 miles per hour. I remember thinking to myself as to what's keeeping this ship from just falling out of the sky. Going way to slow to not fall out of the sky. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I could see the real actual night sky with all the stars in the drk-blue black setting. As it continued passing over, I could see the enormity of this thing as it traveled in a north west direction towards the city of Antioch, Fairfield, Vacaville, Santa Rosa and eventually to the Pacific coast. As it was leaving my area, I was estimating the altitude with the telephone poles in the area. This \"Mothership or whatever took up at least a 3-4 block sq. area and maybe more at an altitude no more than 300 - 400 ft in the air  and was so quiet (not a peep)it was noisy. I don't know what made me look up. My address at that time was very close to where the Calaveras river dumps into the deep water channel.

We saw 30 in an hour on the first night. I tried to video tape them, but my video camera wouldn't pick them up. On the second night, we counted 40 in two hours and they didn't seem to stop, they just kept on coming across the sky. We did notice an anomaly with the sightings. We could almost predict when one was coming because it became very still, there would be no breeze, then we would hear a slight \"whoosh\" sound and a falling star would fall. Then a few more would come across the sky. The secound night I caught a split second of one on my video camera because it was so bright that it was blinding if you looked at it. We even saw one change course to chase a plane in the sky. This was a very strange thing for us to witness, we felt like we where being invaded and will probably see more tonight. Maybe these are just sattelites, but we dont think that is the case. We also see 2-3 white cigar shaped objects during the day, that appear to be incorperated into the seeding programs in our area. We don't know what they are, but hopfully others are seeing them in kansas. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

I would say it was perhaps 500-1000 feet off the ground, but its hard to say, because, well I know this sounds weird, but its shape was hard to make out the closer it got. It looked spherical, and was scintillating, and curiously, the air around it seemed to shimmer - it was hard to see its edge, that's the only way I can describe it. It moved silently from my left, and I was thinking to myself that if it stopped it would have be a UFO. And then, as if it heard my thought, it stopped directly in front of me! I just stared at it, and I had the most curious feeling of being watched, hard to describe, just felt as if it realized I was looking - so I waved at it.  It then started to slowly go up into the sky. As it was going up, its color seemed to change to a whitish metallic, almost like sodium. And then, it began to flash. A bright, neon green, then pink, and yellow. It also - sounds weird again - seemed to phase in and out of the air. It would seem to disappear, then I would see one of the flashes, and it would appear again at some distance and disappear. This continued until it was a tiny speck in the sky and then I couldn't see it anymore. Interesting day. If you can help me identify what I saw, or let me know if other people have seen similar craft, I would be very appreciative. Thank you for your time.",

At first we thought it was a falling star and then I said falling stars skim the atmosphere! Then we thought possibly a meteor, but did not see any explosion or fire from the landing. As we continued to drive, we did a relative size comparison such as: bigger than my Honda CR-V  car tire, bigger than a merge sign, bigger than the small bushes lining the highway. From the distance that we saw the object, we agreed that it was approximately as big as a small car such as a Metro or similar. The shape was hard to determine due to the trail of fire. The flames were coming up from the head and there was a short flame tail behind it. The color was bright white when we first saw it at approximately 1,000 feet up and then became a greenish color (which my passenger commented was the color of a hot object cooling down). I have been unable to locate any news reports of this incident on the internet, newspapers or local TV news websites.",

      "story": "change from a rectangle to a old screaming 707 airliner balactica June 22, 2012 In the summer of august 1981, my wife and son were traveling in the area of Stockton airport Stockton California. When we saw a bright light to the east above the horizon about 15 deg the size of the light was twice that of a landing light of a common commercial airliner.  It was about 70 miles away from us.  I worked for a major airline at the time. So I know what a large transporter would look like. So I deceited to park at the end of the run way and watch a touch and go of aircraft because pilots from major airlines use Stockton airport to training.  Anyhow as the craft approached the control area I figured that the aircraft would do a regular base and final approach,  and touch and go but what happen was this.  The craft was at the same height as the control tower and it looked like the ship was going to crash into the control tower and went on the other side of the tower and across the small aircraft hangars still heading west. As its approached us about 5 cars were a! t the end of the runway and we all got out of our cars and I saw the rectangle black metallic, with lights flashing all around it ufo approach us all going across the highway airport boulevard at 25 feet off the ground moving at a speed of 3 miles per hour. Very very slow its length of a football field, height 40 feet, width 75 feet. As it slowly move in front of all of us there was port holes of 3 where you can see being inside that resembled tall thin looking figures looking at us.  I had a strong flash light and I shined the light into the port hole and gave a delta sign with my light.  As the ship was in front of us a old type of Buick 1951 sedan black car approached the ship with a person inside it drivers side with looked like a man in black and he didn\u2019t even see the ship.  He was gone after that.   We watch the ship make a long round approach into the delta for about 10 minutes.  After that I went to the control tower and reported a ufo as I was doing this other peo! ple were calling up the tower and reporting the same thing.  I! asked t he tower if any aircrafts had come into this area in the last 10-15 minutes and they said no aircraft came through at all.  It is impossible for the tower not to see the large spot light 70 miles away and than the tower high craft passing behind the tower.  After that we left the area a headed south on hwy 99 towards modest California and there we saw the bright light again. It had made a large circle around the the Stockton , Manteca, lathrope.   I saw it coming very fast and low maybe 30 feet .  I went under the over pass of Manteca 99 hwy and saw the ship change shape from a rectangle to a old 707 aircraft and screaming very low and very old looking battle ship.  We were shocked in its new appearance.  After that I went home and call blue book and reported it.  Many years later mufon people wanted to hear our story and put my wife and I under hipnotics because my wife said she saw  the ship at Stockton airport went on top of her and I saw it to the side.   That the story.",

      "story": "Seven Beautiful luminous orange orange orbs dance away above Stockton California I was looking at the moon around 11pm, and immediately noticed about 7 massively bright orange/amber \"orbs,\" perfectly aligned in almost a triangle shape.  They were still at first, and then started to dance around each other, and some even merged into one another to form a bigger and brighter ball of light.  They were pretty far away, but massively luminously bright and pulsating.  I yelled for my girlfriend to grab her phone but by the time she grabbed it and opened the video app, we only managed to film the last one that was fading away in the distance.  It was like nothing I've seen before.  So beautiful! No air craft or drone that far could emit such massive light, travel so fast, and move in the different directions, that I witnessed.   They disappeared headed northeast from Stockton, toward Highway 99, maybe more toward Lockford, CA.   So beautiful and majestic and defied laws of physics in my humble non-expert opinion.",

In those last seconds, 2 white lights blinked next to each other a few times stationary.  Then 2 seperate like shooting stars going in seperate directions left the sky.  Wow!!!

I scanned around to see what he was talking about and when i looked up i saw a triangular formation of 3 blurry white lights.  I could not tell if it was a solid triangular craft or 3 seperate orbs butthey looked like they were eminating heat difracting the light around it. sadly it went out of view behind some trees before I could pull out my phone and attempt to record anything on my shitty camera.  As I chased after it to get a better view it was just gone but it was at low altitude and only looked like it was going roughly 60 mph southbound.   Afte ra few minutes of looking around for more objects another friend of mine pointed a similar formation out but higher and going north possibly the same craft/orbs which just appeared flew for a short distance and suddenly was gone. My initial thought was mabey it was a triangu! lar craft with a partial cloaking device as it did appear to come from nowhere it might have been in the process of cloaking and as I chased it was completely invisible or it sped up I really don't know. I thought I would be more prepared for such a sighting but it actually shook me up a little though I thought I had seen a few,once before for sure but that was a while ago.  There did seem to be an influx of helicopter traffic after the sighting over the amount of airplanes flying by which where very distinguishable it was a clear night.  The object/s where completely silent.",

It was bright and sunny without any clouds in sight, and I noticed a single, extremely bright, but small, white to pale yellowish light at very high altitude.   At first I assumed it was a high flying plane that was reflecting sunlight.  I thought it was odd but didn't think much of it really.   After a few minutes I looked up again, not expecting to still see it there, but it was, and seemed like it had barely moved at all.   So at that point I started really paying attention to it and noticed it was slowly getting brighter then dimmer and even disappearing from sight completely sometimes.   Over the next hour or so it very slowly moved across the sky from the northeast toward the south, never actually reaching the horizon.  The kids eventually got bored at the playground, so we moved on to go walk across the foot bridge, and by the time we made it through the trees and into clear skyline, again, I couldn't relocate it.
