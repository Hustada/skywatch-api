      "story": "colorado springs, colorado saw  a object at night 3 multi-colored lights at the time of this i was 15 years old(i am 16 now) and i was on vacation in colorado sping, colorado. i was staying in a hotel in..manituo?(that is spelled wrong) manituo springs. my mom said i HAD to go to this place called \"flying w ranch\" or something like that. and really i didn;t care to be there. there was this thing that some people sang unill maby 11:00 pm.. pretty late. and i was pretty bored so i looked at the sky at about about after the first hour it starts wich was 7 or 6. since it was the mountains and i live in kansas it was beautifull to me. so basicly i ignored the music and look at the sky and the sunset. at about 9 i started try to spot out differant conssilations. i looked at oryans bet and i saw something wrong. there was an extra star. so i thought maby a sattilight off track or something because it looked like it was moving like a weather sattlight. but then it shot a littil ways to the north. i thought wow...that is a weird air plane. and didn;t think anything of it. but i kept looking at it because then i noticed the star was more than one. it had three lights and they were differnt colors. one was blue i am shure of it. one was redish orange something of the mix. and other was greenish yellish coler. at that time i thought it was simply a very advanced jet the air force  had built. for as i had been told that area had a air force base near the area. then i was the craft shoot south. in a small triangluler shape.( if u conected the places it stoped) (the whole time i was wathcing it it seemed to be shaking or vibrated very fastly but not enuff to distort was i was seeing. (the whole time the craft was in the northern sky) every time it changed postions i looked farther than it went because it moved so fast i thought there was no way it could move that fast and stop so fast. (it moved so fast my eyes barly registerd that it moved) but anyways at it had moved in the northern part of the triangle it slowly seemed to be moving up maby farther from the atmospere. it;s very hard to explain. but the lights begain fading but not because of distance more of the width of the circles of light. the width begain getting slimmer and slimmer. and the lights begain changed shades to darker. and the craft all of a sudden shut of the lights. but i could still see it was there.( like black on black) the only way to describe it was that some people have good enuff eye sight to see the part of the moon that isn;t being shone with light from the sun. baslicly like that. as i stated into the darkness of the craft in a split second it seemed to dissapere and i saw a few stars the apperd (normal stars) kinda like something was blocking it. aka the craft. when my mind finnaly register that i had seen somewthing i coudn't explain i kept thinking of aircrafts that might be simmiler to what i have seen. the only thing i could think of was the airplanes developed by canada that looked simmiler to a sauser. but this WASN;T round at all. defanlty a triange the lights that i saw iluminated parts of the ship. it was gray. i didn;t hear any sound cuz them dumb hillbillys were too loud. haha oh also i am sending a crrapy drawn picture that might help explain it if possable please call me or get back to me i would like to talk and further explain. ASK FOR ((name deleted)) OR U WILL NOT GET TO TALK TO ME thank you and i hope u consider me not crazy hahah.",

It appeared very white against the bright blue morning sky.  The object was flying from West to East.  Just to my west is the Front Range Rocky Mountains and Mt. Cheyenne. It did not emit noise that I could hear.  It flew in a very straight line. The object had zero lights.  No wings or tail. It did not waiver up or down.  It did not tilt side to side.  Just flew in what appeared to be a straight line. Wanting to catch it on film, I ran inside my home and grabbed my iPhone.  I was able to record the object on video.  The video is terrible (of course ) as I couldn\u2019t see it (the object) in the sky through my screen so I moved the camera around a lot but the camera was able to record it. When it flew behind (in?)(through?) a white cloud it was still visible although the top of the object appeared to become more white and domed-shaped with the bottom becoming rounder in appearance and darker. On video, when it comes out of the cloud it then looks to be 3 spheres in a close triangle formation. The video when slowed down and zoomed or viewed frame by frame is the best way to see it, but after a hundred times once you know what you\u2019re looking it\u2019s clear as day.",

      "story": "Triangular black craft in broad daylight hovering high and then speeding off. This sighting has stuck clearly in my memory for 20+ years although I only occasionally thought about it over the years as you hear about UFOs.  It was a sight where you instantly know this is something extraordinary and not what our brains are used to processing and seeing.  I never really investigated anything more about it over the years because the craft I saw was triangular and I never heard of anyone seeing such a thing.  Until yesterday.  I watched a cable special about the UFO incident in 2000 near St. Louis with the various officer sightings of a black triangular object.  I then checked the internet to see about sightings in Colorado at roughly the same time of mine.  I have goose bumps again to see so many similar sightings from seemingly credible accounts.  My story is brief but it left a permanent record on my mind.  I can't remember the exact date but it was in the early 1980s and I was a passenger in a car with my brother driving.  We were on a small street road near our house and it was daylight and very clear.  As we were driving, I casually glanced at Pikes Peak which occupies a large part of the mountainous view in Colorado Springs.  Near the top (above treeline) and slightly to the right of Pikes Peak was a triangular black object that appeared to be rotating.  It was close to Pikes Peak and probably 5 miles from me - line of sight.  I could tell it was very large given its relative dimension to Pikes Peak just behind it.  Had this been at night I could have dismissed it as any possible craft but being a clear day I was instantly startled as to what this was.  I had a good familiarity with military aircraft with my father in the Air Force and growing up in Colorado Springs near the Air Force Academy.  As I stated, the fact that it was triangular and didn't seem to have any other discernable shape or markings, I was amazed at what this might be.  I immediately told my brother to look and even told him \"stop the car\" and look.  By the time he finished asking \"what is it\" and stopped the car, I watched it disappear at an incredible speed over and behind Pikes Peak.  I never saw it or anything like it again but after reading these accounts I felt I had to add my story to the many accounts listed.  I am shocked to see many accounts even older than mine of similar sightings which indicates it could not have been any kind of experimental military craft.  I hope one day I can find out what it was and solve the mystery. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "A saucer, flying only about 50 feet in the air, right above the middle of Colorado Springs. I've never believed in the existence of UFOs until now.  Yesterday, at about 8:50 PM, I was driving eastbound on Academy Boulevard (this is a major road of Colorado Springs, and goes right through the middle of the city), when I saw a few lights floating above a shopping center right next to the road. I was traveling about 35-40 mph at this time and got closer to it quickly.  Within a few seconds, I realized that the lights all belonged to the same object, and were then slowly moving above Academy, only about 50 feet in the air. It came at an angle towards me (or perhaps I was just moving towards it faster than I thought), and for about five seconds, it was close enough for me to see the details of it. It was the classic saucer shape, with maybe 6-8 white lights around the circular base of it, and one white light at the top. The top, however, was pointed as if a large cone were placed on the top of the main saucer part. It was dark, but I'm fairly certain that the UFO was black or dark grey, and probably the equivalent of 2 or 3 cars in total mass. After about five seconds of it floating only about 50 feet away from me, it banked and did a u-turn, flying away at a much higher speed than it had been before (although it was impossible to estimate the speed at night in those conditions, its accelaration was definately much more than a helicopter could have managed). I saw the lights of it for a few seconds more, then lost it within the glow of the city. I would guess that there were many more witnesses (it was a busy city street, after all) and there should be more reports on the same saucer. Yes, this did happen on halloween night, and I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it so clearly (it may as well have landed and let me walk up and touch it), but it was very frightening because of what I might have just witnessed. Technology like that that we don't know about scares me and makes me wonder what else the government has in terms of power. I still don't believe it was extraterrestrial, because the statistical chances of that are improbable almost to the point of impossibility, but the fact that it exists at all is fairly horrifying.

I witnessed for the first time the most unbelievable thing that proves something I didn't believe in before I witnessed it occur. The United States Government scrambled jets to intercept groups of alien craft all day long as I sat and watched it from my living room window. I am in such disbelief, because like I said I was not a firm believer in life outside of our own planetary system. It is the truth, the craft I saw moved so quick, made no noise, but our craft being F-15 fighters I believe or something similar in nature, we able to use their weapons systems, perhaps modified systems, and shot them down...catching flame and landing in the mountain range of the Rocky Mountains. The craft, all 9 of them, fell from the sky when our weapons hit them, which indicated to me that in fact they were destroyed. Right now I am certain that because it did not make the news, that there is a top secret cover up, naturally the government wanting to keep this under wraps and I can understand the reasoning. The craft kept appearing, making me believe that we were not being successful in hitting them with our weapons systems. I saw trails, indicating something was fired from our craft towards theirs. Then I saw two craft together, indicating to me that in fact we were destroying their craft afterall, since they struck both craft together and they fell to the ground at a fast pace. The total number of planes of our aircraft varied throughout the day as they scrambled to attack them, but they arrived quickly and to my surprise given that our craft appear to be such lower in technology than theirs...but to my surprise again, simple systems of weaponry brought down what must have been intruders in our airspace and caught or detected by Space Command or Norad, or some other top secret detection facility...I'm convinced that we must have such things now that I am convinced that we've had bad visitors from outerspace. Their craft were triangular in shape, could move in any direction in an instant, but for some ! reason t hey weren't able to duck and weave whatever weapon it was that the United States Air Force was firing upon them, which was something unconventional you could tell by their streams that they left in the air...very different looking, almost as if to trace the location of the missiles from start to finish. I believe, knowing weapons systems very well from the Reagan era that are in use today, despite treaties, that satellites lit up the craft from the sky up high, and the missiles were guided directly to their targets without fail. I did see one alien craft seem to disappear in an instant, or it traveled from its location in an instant. All 9 craft that I saw were hit and fell to the ground behind some mountains. All scrambling jets ceased to fly once they were shot down, but it's not reported in the media and I haven't heard of anyone else seeing what I saw. So I do know it's being covered up in large scale. This is not the first sighting I've had with triangular craft. A group of about 7 or so flew directly over my condo one night, had zero noise in propulsion, flew very slow, and were lit up from beneath for all to witness, didn't seem to be afraid of showing themselves off. This event was in Lakewood, CO at the time probably 2 years ago.",

Upon reaching south Powers Boulevard, a second craft appeared, identical to the one previous. This craft again descended and glided over me. I became panicked as the craft continued to move in my direction. I turned my car around and began to travel west, towards my home. Eventually the craft ascended away from me, traveling north east.

On Oct. 2, 2007 around 11:00 PM I was outside saying goodbye to a few friends.  As they drove away I looked up at the night stars and noticed something strange.  There was what appeared at first to be an airplane flying east to west toward an area between Pikes Peak and Cheyenne Mountain. The object was flashing red and white lights and was flying in and unusual jerking manner.  It may have been the irregually flashing lights that made it appear to be not flying straight.  A couple neighbors where out walking.  I mentioned what I was watching and they stopped for about 5 mins. and also saw the object.  After watching for about 10 mins. the object moved more south toward Cheyenne Mt. It was over the mountains now.  Then it disappeard for a quick second or two. When it reappeard there were two objects now flashing. They stayed together for only a couple mins.  The first (I think it was the first object) began heading back toward the east the same way it had come.  The other object remained stationary above the mountain.  The object above the mountain slowly \"flickered out\" over several minutes.  The other object continued headed east. As it passed overhead I could make out the shape of the craft by the configuration of the lights. I could make out four distinct lights.  It was triangular. After a few more minutes the object was no longer in my view.  It seemed like the second object became visible when the first object reached it's destination. I have seen similar objects with these kind of flickering lights over Colorado Springs previously.  However, I have never seen one appear out of no where.  They usually just fly a straight path until they're out of sight.  This one had a purpose to it's flight.",

      "story": "Craft near AFB followed aircraft then proceeded south at a constant rate through changes in direction and elevation he shape was not clear since the color of the craft matched the sky haze.  The only reason the craft was so visible was the reflection it gave off but the reflection did not show the exact outline.  However the reflection(s) allowed use to visually follow the craft while my friend and I kept asking each other, \"Have you ever seen an aircraft do that?\", over and over.  Al was over Saturday evening and I saw my first UFO.  Craziest thing I've ever seen.  I still don't believe it was an Alien thing but it wasn't any typical aircraft.  The speed and its maneuvering looked impossible.  It chased two planes over the airport going two different directions, dodged another and then dove close to the ground and proceeded south all in 10-12 seconds.  It was at dusk so the sun was going down but shinning on the vehicle.  It was white and no lights of any kind.  It had to be a pearl white or like that reflective 3M white tape or sign material.  It was not shiny metallic but definitely white but a halogen white.  It did not have a vertical stab, rudder and it was a little hazy so there was no way to make out any detail.  There has been a lot of activity at the Ft. Carson and Peterson since this weekend.  My guess is that it is some sort of new flight vehicle and they were testing it.  It was likely also very stealthy so I assume it was likely not picked up on radar, especially considering what it did and the speed involved.  It was directly east when I saw it and farther out than an approach for the airport.  It came around and come up behind the first plane and veered off coming around to approaching the second plane coming in at a right angle to the first plane.  That was an 'S' shape that covered more than 12 miles.  Then it went south and dodged a plane on approach while in a steep dive.  After it came close to the ground it leveled off and proceeded south.  It did this all within 8 seconds, no longer.  It did not seem to lean into turns as an aircraft would and looked like it stayed level.  Neither Al or I could make out its shape except it did not have a rudder.  The only plane that I know that could do this would be an F-22 but there was no sound.  Something maneuvering that fast should have made some pretty noticeable throttling jet engine sounds.  If the F-22 has noise suppression maybe, flying an experimental pattern and painted pearl or reflective white.  My guess and feel after just watching the Thunderbirds at graduation is it was traveling just under mach one.  Also it did not change speed either in the hard maneuvers or when it dove.  It just looked really odd.  Neither Al or I took our eyes off of it until we could not see it any longer and just started laughing.  He's retired Army advanced radar and communications technician.  The F-22 has vector thrust but it makes a lot of noise and it still looses speed in hard maneuvers.  One thing this was not was winged aircraft, even an F-22 with vectored thrust.  It made maneuvers that only a helicopter could make but at a speed that had to be just below mach one at 7000 to 10000 ft. elevations.  The two sincere giveaways that this was a special craft was first it flew over an municipal airport and Air Force Base with no lights and in two flight paths of other aircraft and came very close to the rear of those two plane with no clearance lights or landing lights\u2026 all very illegal for either military or civilian aircraft.  The second giveaway was either drastic changes in direction or elevation did not change the velocity of the craft in the slightest.  I am not a believer in extraterrestrials, an engineer and would have to see either an extraterrestrial or their craft closely before I could possibly believe.  Someone owns and operates on incredible aircraft for sure.",

The weather was foggy with a fair amount of snow beginning to fall, accompanied by a moderate breeze.  I'd stopped at a stoplight, located near the old Colorado Springs airport.  To my left (east), about 50 or 60 feet above the ground, I saw 3 identical, white colored, down shining lights (appearing similar to those housed in recessed \"can\" lighting fixtures); they were very, VERY slowly, smoothly hover-gliding forward, together.  Two slender blue-colored bars of light were positioned behind, and perpendicular to the \"nose\" light, but within the boundaries of the triangular configuration formed by the larger 3 white lights.  There may have been a small red light located between and/or just behind the blue bar shaped lights.  Due to the time of night and poor weather conditions, I could not see the body of the craft... just the lights on its under belly.  At first, I thought the lights were reflections on my windshield, but I couldn't determine their source.  I looked at other drivers around me to see if they had noticed the lights but they appeared to be oblivious as the weather/visability was poor and the drivers were concentrating on the stoplight, waiting for it to change from red to green.  The thick fog and snowfall reflected the street and city lights to provide a sort of overall orange glow.  Thinking that the lights were reflections, I remained still, using the frame of my windshield to verfiy that the lights were indeed moving, and that they weren't reflections.  The lights continued to glide, VERY slowly, foward.  The 3 lights formed an elongated, triangle configuration; one round light in front (\"leading\" the direction of movement), with 2 identical round lights behind.  The overall size was approximately the size of an USAF F4 or F15. Since all the lights moved with identical speed and direction at the same time, it seemed probable that they were attached to one body.  There was no noise and the craft's movement left the fog and snowflakes undisturbed.  After moving forward, the hovering craft paused, then VERY slowly, smoothly made a slight banking action to it's right, then slowly and smoothly, (without rotating)it drifted in an easterly direction, to disappear, uncerimoniously into the fog and snowfall.  The craft's hovering was steady and constant, without bounce, shake, waver, list, or yaw; it moved much smoother than a helicopter, seemingly unaffected by the poor weather conditions. It reminded me of a British Harrier, but, again, its movement was much, much slower, unwavering and smoother than that type of craft. The only movement that I can equate this craft's with are those displayed by some 3D computer generated and animated \"futuristic\" design aircraft... only this one was real.",

I was at a branch of the local public library on 8th St. when I noticed a small \"study room.\"  Because it was just the type of room I was looking for I noted the room's furnishings using the window next to the door.  Because there were three similar doors along the same wall I decided to see how many were study rooms.   The next door also led to a study room, which was furnished using furniture that seemed identical to the first room; a beautiful new large table and chairs.  Taking a few steps backwards, I looked in the window to the first study room again to see if the furnishings in both rooms were identical.   I also noticed the sign above each of the rooms, \"STUDY ROOM.\"  The first room was a little smaller though.  I was just about to look in the window to the second study room again, when two people walked into it and at the same time a woman came out of the third door.  I then asked her how many study rooms that branch of the library has and, nodding towards the first study room, she answered, \"only that one.\"  I  had looked up at the sign above the second door and the areas above both of the doors each had an identical notice posted, \"Study Room.\"   The wall in the second room was bare and that room was larger.  I use the past tense because when the library employee looked at the wall where both doors had been, the door only to the second study room vanished.  No spaceship seemed present and there was no unusual noise.    But, from previous my experience,  the second study room at my local library branch has not entirely disappeared, its access is strictly controlled.",

I recently watched a documentary (UFOs Seeing is Believing) hosted by Peter Jennings on the National Geographic Channel, which prompted me to report after all this time, something I saw when living in Colorado Springs over 10 years ago. The particular discussion on the type of objects seen in and around Phoenix, AZ at roughly the same time made me think there was something more to what I saw. After returning home from a friend\u2019s house on the evening of the 13th or 14th of March, 1997 at approximately 10:30pm (I remember it was around this time as I had returned from a vacation shortly before, but can\u2019t remember if it was a Thursday or Friday), I went out on my back deck to look at the Hale-Bopp comet which was clearly visible with my small binoculars in the North-Western sky.  At that time I was and still am a Financial Analyst, but have always loved backyard astronomy since I was in Jr. High School and had an issue of Sky & Telescope which told me where to see it. While looking at the comet for several minutes with the binoculars, I saw a distinct flash of light, which caused me to lower them and look to see what had cause it.  For about 10 seconds or so, I saw 5 lights in what seemed to be a triangular formation move quickly from South to North from my perspective.  It moved very fast to the North until it was out of sight, but it was visible long enough to see that the triangular \"V\" formation was kept throughout.  There was no noise or contrail(s) visible (I expected to hear jet noises thinking it was a formation of fighter planes, but there was none). Unfortunately, it moved too fast for me to determine if it was a solid object. This obviously was quite exciting and unusual.  After spending a few more minutes trying in vain to see the object(s) again, I thought this was peculiar enough to report to someone. I looked in the phonebook for someone to call and eventually spoke briefly to a person (whose name I cannot remember) at the local MUFON contact number and gave him the description of what I had seen.  As it was quite late, I agreed to call back the next day to go over the sighting in more detail, but I did not call again.  After thinking it over and keeping in mind that the simplest explanation is most often the right one, I determined that it had to be a formation of fighter planes or maybe a stealth fighter which sort of has that shape. After seeing this documentary and subsequently researching the so-called Phoenix Lights on-line, what I saw and especially the time I saw it is a little too coincidental. I have never seen anything like that before or since, but due to the similarities with what was seen in Arizona, I thought it was time to report what I saw.

I'm coming up to the object and I see a row of well yellow lit windows so bright you can\u2019t make out the inside compartment. But not a blinding eliminating light just well lit and yellow in color. I\u2019m driving at about 30mph now and the object is to my right and I can see the underbelly it had green strips of lights all over the undercarriage of the craft and the body of the craft was black and blended in with the night sky so well I really could not make out the shape or even the hole size of the craft. It was very well triangle shape from the way the green lights were lade out on the bottom of the craft and! I rolle d down my window again and heard not one sound. At this time a second car had pulled over to the side of the road and started flashing its light and the object with out banking in any direction to the left or right to turn seemed to go back in the direction it came from towards the airport. I speed to the nearest cross section to make a u-turn and race to the airport with the object still in sight. I have to stop at a stop light and lose the object behind a set of buildings that a recently gone up in the last two or so years. Its very bright over buy the buildings as if the craft was hiding but the buildings are on a gated road I don\u2019t have access to and I can' see the craft anymore. I'm leaving back towards work and I'm looking at the new buildings that I have never seen before and it seems there is a private run way and some indicator lights lighting up a run way path I've never seen before. And there seem to be an airplane hanger right behind this new building that\u2019s just off the main run way to the locale airport, where I think this object my have landed and possibly if it was not a true UFO may have been stored away. Any way I tried to Google maps the location of the building and it seems they are brushed out of the picture or were not built when the photo was taken. I saw this craft up-close and for a very long time, I'm more then sure I'm not the only one in the area as it was flying very close to the ground and very slowly no aircraft other then a helicopter could have pulled off the speeds but not the maneuvers. I wish I would have had my camera to take photos. It was not any aircraft I have ever seen nor was it your typical UFO sighting as the object did not glow did not have over powering bright lights or laser beams. On the ride out to the baseI work at I saw what seemed to be more aircraft all NONUFO and very identifiable in the sky then I've seen in a long time it was as if they were looking for some thing. I will be keeping an eye out and would like to know where I could better report my f! indings or receive any information or any other repotted similar sights for that night in my area.",

      "story": "bluish white colored disc flys silently across sky and vanishes It's difficult to be exact about the time I saw my UFO. I guess about 2 months ago is reasonably close. I've talked to several people about what I saw and was litterly laughed at each time. And reasonably so, I've stopped discussing it with anyone at all. That is until finding this section on your website. So here goes. \t My wife and I were late getting home one nite so I suggested we put a couple of steaks on the grill and have a quick and simple dinner and hop into bed, readying for another days ordeal. I had just fired up the grill and was still holding and folding the grill cover in my hands. I was staring out into the night sky looking at the star formations as I usually do when out at night. I suddenly noticed a rather strange light going across the sky in a West to East direction rather high in the sky. At first I thought it was merely a commercial plane at that altitude but soon realized I saw no usual vapor trail nor jet exhaust sound. But the thing that caught my attention foremost was the fact that I saw no flashing navigational lights. I thought that was especially odd. I knew it was proceeding across the sky because I could see the stationary night stars behind it. I continued to gaze at the moving light as it maintained what appeared to be a constant speed when suddenly it starting becoming brighter in appearance. As I continued looking at it, it actually took on a more distinguishing look about itself. The light started turning a brilliant beautiful color of blue, a shade of blue I'd never seen before. Almost like an electric arc from a plug wire. Ok, here's the crazy part, as I watched it, it developed a wide looking ring around the outside diameter of itself. This ring was a much brighter shade of blue than the inner section appeared to be. It litterly gave the appearance of what Saturn with it's rings looked like, except it was oval shaped in it's center. The two individual and separate colors illuminated its shape completely. \t I know what I saw, and this is what I saw. I continued to stare at it, half thinking that if I dropped my gaze it would disappear from me or I'd loose a visual on it. I decided to call my wife to come and take a look, not taking my gaze off it, so I called her several times but she didn't hear me in time. \tThen I did the most stupid thing of all, I decided to lay the grill cover down and walk out in the yard to get a better viewing of this object. Laying down that cover took no more than 1 second for me at the most but when I gazed back up in the sky where it last was, there was nothing to see. I mean nothing at all. Not a trace of it could be seen! From initial first sighting until it vanished was perhaps 8 seconds. But I know what I saw. My lasting regret  even till now was taking my eyes off it and missing how it managed to disappear from my line of sight. It's completely impossible for me to have misplaced it in the night sky when there were no other aircraft in the sky at that time. And how did NORAD not pick it up either, as I can see the military installation from my front yard! So call me crazy if you will but what I've written here is the absolute and complete truth as I would derive no personal satisfaction in fabricating such a wild story just to make myself look crazy in the end. I believe with all my heart what I saw that stary night was actually a craft not from our planet but rather from some place outside our Solar System and will continue to believe so until the day I die. I thank you for reading my story and hope that you will believe me. Again, Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "UFO hovers off of mile marker 129 (Interstate 25) in Colorado Springs?? We were headed south on I-25 towards Pueblo, CO when at approximately 9:30 PM I saw a bright light ahead of our vehicle in the distance.  Assuming it was a low flying airplane or a helicopter with the bright search light on, I watched without much thought or concern.  After about 5 minutes passed I realized that the object had not moved and we were getting closer to it.  As we got near, the one light from the distance became two distinct lights with a couple red lights in between.  Again reminding me of a plane, however, this object was still stationary.  We actually passed the object at around mile marker 129 (it was to the east of the interstate) and at this point we could make out the three bright white lights in a triangle shape.  The object NEVER moved.  I also noticed some blinking coming from on top of the craft, I could make out two brighter white lights that would blink up high and one of the red lights blink below.  The craft made no sound and continued to hover as it got smaller in the distance of us driving away.  In total, I watched the object for about 15 to 20 minutes.  This length of time rules out the possibility of it being a low flying airplane because that would have come and gone in minutes.  The helicopter is the only logical explanation, but that doesn\u2019t explain the silence nor the triangle shape of the lights (and I could be wrong, but I thought they could not hover in one spot for too long of a time).   Furthermore, I have seen many helicopters growing up in Colorado next to all the airports and air force base and I\u2019ve never seen one stay perfectly still for as long as this did.",

It seems too low for any government aircraft to be hovering.  I could email a few-second video I took.",

I used a Canon T2i digital camera (18 Meg) set at ISO 800 and for 10 second exposures.  Each picture was taken 30 seconds apart.   With those settings, any objects like airplanes, fireworks, an even helicopters would show a trail.  Even the stars, if you zoom in, would show a small trail due to the earth rotation during 10 seconds of exposure. The flying objects in the photos were pretty steady in their positions, except that they seem to appear and dissapear without leaving a trail.  Notice the change from photos number 5 and 6, where quite a few objects appeared from the twighlight zone. These objects were not visible with the naked eye.  They showed up in my pictures due to the high sensitivity of the camera and the long exposure.  The last three photos are just enlargerments of the first 3 (the originals).  I promise there is no photoshop involved in this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

This sighting took place over my neighborhood in Colorado Springs.  I was parked near my home to finish listening to the last part of a Coast to Coast show.  This show had nothing to do with UFOs by the way, so UFOs were not on my mind.  I reclined my driver's seat to gaze up at the sky while listening.   Suddenly a red/orange translucent sphere appeared in the sky.  It moved slowly for maybe 1 quarter mile (in my estimation) in a north-easterly direction before slowly disappearing back into the blue.  It was day light outside with no stars showing, nor were there any clouds near this object. However, there was a nearby plane (civilian Leer jet type of plane).  I have no idea if the pilot noticed the orange sphere.  This plane was useful only in that it gave me an indication of the altitude, whatever that typically is for Leer Jets.

The segment was on the wildfires in Colorado during the last 2 minutes of the show.  The footage shows a helicopter pouring chemicals onto a fire on a hillside in dense smoke, and suddenly from the lower left of the screen, a white light streaks by from the lower left of the screen diagonally to the upper right of the screen, past the helicopter, and out of the lens view.  Initially, it appears to be a single light, but later appears as 2 lights, but it's hard to tell if this is a second object, or just part of the original object. The film appears to be shot from another helicopter from a considerable distance, and the object appears to be moving too fast to be a bird, and since it is partially obscured by smoke as it emerges, it seems too far away to be a bug or dust. I do not have access to the footage, but maybe the producers at the Ed Show can steer you in the right direction.

At this time, we all discussed what we thought they might be. (Both my roommate and boyfriend are or have been in the military recently).  We ruled out the possibility of helicopters due to how perfectly still they sat, and for how long.  The colors of them should not have been visible at night from the distance we were at as well.  Watching for a few more minutes, we noticed a third object of the same size and color moving down to the other two.  They appeared to be flashing different colors at the same time, but were mainly the redish orange.  One object appeared to have been spraying a liquid (looked like water, but sparkled.  Roommate describes it as \"plasma\").  Then, the objects came to form a perfect triangle.  We unfortunately went inside for a brief few minutes.

The object did not appear to be very large and appeared to be relatively low, maybe 2000-3000 feet and made no noise at all.

On February 29, 2012 at approx. 8:30 pm, I went outside and saw five large lights in a perfect row and slanted to the right in perfect formation.  The lights were yellowish-amber in color and were very bright and strong.  I observed some of the lights turning off so to speak or disappearing only to reappear in the same spot.  As one would disappear, another one would appear on the other side.  So at times, there would be only four lights showing, then three, then five again, etc. It seemed like there was an intelligent pattern to the lights turning off and on.  I watched this for several minutes until one by one they disappeared.   I also noticed the dogs whimpering as well. These lights were so bright that it seemed almost like large car headlights in the sky and approx. a quarter the way up from the horizon.  The following morning I saw on the local news that several others saw these lights and called to report them.  The newscaster said that the Army was claiming that they were flares.  I am a former police officer and have worked with flares many times in the past.  These were definitely not flares due to the fact they could turn off and on at will.  They also stayed in a perfect diagonal line while hovering in the same spot.  There was also no sign of smoke.",

No blinking transponder lights present. The nature of the light seemed closer to starlight, with green rays present.  I stared at the light for a while and it seemed to have three points in the center. The craft moved extremely slowly, the movement almost undetectable.

      "story": "Saw a UFO and spoke to a possible alien. In the fall of 1993 I was working two jobs in order to support my son and myself. My main job was with the Colorado State Police as an officer.  I worked a second job at night. This fall evening I was on my way to work from my home which was in Colorado Springs, Colorado and across the street from the Patty Jewett Golf Course. Backing out of my driveway (my house was second from the corner of a tee intersection) and then moving forward the short distance to the stop sign at the tee intersection, I glanced across the 8th fairway to make sure there weren\u2019t any wild golfers playing at the time.  As I came to a stop and while looking across to the other side of the fairway, I saw a group of oaks that had been there for years.  They stood about 40 feet high or so.  Just above the group of trees I also saw what I thought were white landing lights such as on every FAA regulated plane that I know of.  These lights were very low to the ground about 60-80 feet high.  I realized that this plane was going to crash and probably into me or at least my block.  I just sat there like a fool and watched the lights approach. I also noticed that this plane was moving extremely slow and thought sure it would hit the group of trees on the far side of the 8th fairway. Then it stopped.  It just stopped in mid-air and stayed there for a couple of minutes.  I then knew that this was not a regular plane.  I backed up a few feet and parked my car to the curb and stepped out.  I continued to look at the object as I walked across the street to the chain link fence that ran parallel with the 8th fairway.   I leaned against the fence and continued to watch the object. It suddenly dawned on me that there was no visible object, just the lights.  I strained my eyes to make out some sort of shape to it but failed to make out the outline. I looked around to see if anyone else was watching this thing but couldn\u2019t see anyone.  Nobody on the streets, no one on the course, just absolutely no one anywhere around.    I also noticed that there was no breeze, no sound from any direction, no barking dogs,  just absolute silence. I looked back at the object as it began to move toward me again.  It was only 40 or so feet off the ground and about 100 yards in front of me.  Suddenly it rose above the group of oaks along the edge of the fairway and continued toward me.  Once it cleared the trees it dropped back down close to the ground and just stopped.  That\u2019s when I saw the red and blue lights on the outside of the two white landing lights.  I tried so hard to see some kind of shape but none prevailed.  I could actually see the background and sky right through this, whatever it was. It sat there for about 2 or 3 minutes and began to move sideways.  The  lights were still facing toward me but moving sideways.  That\u2019s when I saw the outline of the vehicle.  It was cigar shaped with a red light at one end and a blue light at the other.  The white landing lights were in the middle. The only reason I could see the outline is because when it moved sideways I could see the jagged edges of the craft.  (if you have ever seen the movie \u201cPredator\u201d  with Arnold Schwarzenegger the only way they could see the alien was when he moved and they could see the jagged edges of his body)  This is the way it was with this craft. Being raised an Air Force brat and having lived on more air bases than I want to remember I can tell you now this was no ordinary air craft.  It made no sound what so ever. The craft moved sideways down the length of the fairway (south) until it reached another section of houses where it stopped, rose above the houses and vanished.  I followed in my car until it was gone and then proceeded on to work. That\u2019s the first half of the story. My night job was manager of an up-scale nightclub and restaurant. I arrived at the club and entered through the front door.  As you come into the club you find a very large raised horseshoe bar to your left and a raised dining area to the right.  A 3 ft. wall separated the entry way from the dining area and the bar on either side. As I came in one of my girls (cocktail waitress) approached to inform me of some issues I needed to attend to ASAP.  As she spoke I looked toward the bar to find 3 or 4 customers sitting and having cocktails. One man was sitting on a bar stool but was leaning back against the bar and staring at me. As I continued to speak to my girl, this man continued to stare at me.  At first I thought he was going to cause some sort of trouble so I kept a close eye on him as well. After my girl left the man at the bar rose and came up to me.  He asked if we could speak outside for a few minutes.  I agreed and followed him outside half expecting to be in a fist fight or something.  We stood in the middle of the sidewalk in front of the club and he asked me if I saw something funny on my way to work tonight.  I asked him how he would know about anything funny I may or may not have seen. This guy told me that they were checking up on me because I was one of the \u201cspecial ones\u201d.  To this day I don\u2019t know what he meant by that. For twenty minutes he stood there and told me of my entire life from the time I was born to the present moment, reminding me of things I had long forgotten about or just kept secret from anyone else. Then he asked me if I remembered the night (when I was a young boy playing on the floor of my parents\u2019 house) that a red light beam came through the window of the living room, across the wall and floor and then disappear. I told him I had no recollection of anything such event.  He then pulled out a business card and handed it to me.  As he did, I looked down at it as he placed it in my hand.  I scanned it quickly and looked up to ask him something and he was gone.  He was gone. For years I kept this information from anyone in fear of being labeled some sort of crackpot and I didn\u2019t want to lose my police position with the State. In time I moved from Colorado to California.  In June of 2002 my father died unexpectedly. I returned to Colorado for his funeral and came back to California to my home.  In November of 2002 I went back to my parents\u2019 home in Colorado Springs to have Thanksgiving with my mother and other family members. After dinner, we all sat around the table telling stories and jokes when I spoke up and said that I had a story to tell.  There were about 20 family members there and they were all chuckling as I told the story of my strange event.  When I got to the part about the red light coming through the window and across the wall and floor, my mother dropped her fork on the plate.  Everyone stopped talking.  It was absolute silent when she said that she remembered that like it was yesterday.  She said that this red beam came through the picture window of the living room, ran across the wall down to the floor and across the floor to the opposite wall.  She also said that dad got up out of his chair and went out on the front porch to see where the light was coming from but there wasn\u2019t anything out front. When mom got done telling her tale of the red light the laughter was gone.  It continued to be silence for several minutes. I don\u2019t know whatever happened to that business card that guy gave me but I must have lost it during my move to California.",

I was walking south on 19th street from Uintah, I got less than a block from Boulder Ave, looked up and to the right and saw it.  At vaguely 60-65 degrees, I saw a strange craft of only a vaguely discernable shape. It was either an egg shape, or a fat disk, the size of an F-150 truck.   The rectangular shaped light panels were so bright and tonights overcast haze conspired to obscure it.  The objects &quot;from west- to south&quot; trajectory put  its position from my point of view to be roughly a mile and a half from 19th and Boulder Ave. I would suppose that it was hovering over the areas between 21st and 18th from west to east, and pikes peak avenue and the Highway 24 corridor from north to south.  I would guess that it was about 100- 150 ft. In altitude, slower than a plane, but faster than a chopper.  The object did not continue its west to east flight, it came down!  It was no helicopter!

      "story": "Slowly and evenly pulsing light that alternated between invisible and extremely bright as it travelled North. I was sitting on my deck at about 2255 using my iPad when, out of my peripheral vision, I noticed what looked like an extremely bright meteor, gradually increasing in brightness to the Southwest of my location (about 260-270 degrees azimuth).  It was about 45 degrees elevation, fairly close to Saturn. As I watched the object, it slowly decreased in brightness until it was invisible.  I thought, that's cool, I just saw a meteor that must have been headed straight towards me because it left no trail at all.  Then less than a minute later, it showed up again a little farther North.  But this time I watched as it gradually and evenly increased from invisible to a tiny pinprick of light, then to it's full brightness and back again to invisible. At this point, I ran inside to get my fiancee to come outside to witness it.  I told her to look up to where I guessed it would show up again, and sure enough, after about 10 seconds, it appeared again - exactly like the previous two times.  I had her run inside to get my binoculars, and while she was gone, it appeared one last time before it disappeared from view. At its maximum brightness, the object was much brighter than any object in the sky - brighter even than Jupiter at its maximum brightest.  The object appeared to be travelling  North from around Saturn towards Ursa Major and was completely silent.  Also, it seemed to be travelling significantly higher and/or slower than commercial airplanes normally fly.  The color of the light was always brilliant white when visible.  Finally, the object spent more time invisible than visible as it was travelling.    I've seen countless planes and helicopters around here (a couple miles Southeast of the US Air Force Academy) and have never seen one that had lights like this object.  I've seen satellites as well and this object appeared much, much brighter than any satellite I've ever observed.  The entire sighting lasted for about 3 minutes.",

Right as we reached the Woodmen exit I saw something out of the corner of my eye that attracted my attention.  My daughter was driving so i was able to stare at this until it disappeared.  Up and to the left of our car I saw a very fast moving bright green/yellow ball of light that had a green trail like a commit.  I\u2019ve seen \"falling stars\" before and it looked a lot like that in that it got bigger and brighter until it \"disappeared\" only it was bright green and it wasn\u2019t way up in the sky. It was very low.  I know this wasn\u2019t an optical illusion because I could see the outline of the mountain and it was definitely below the mountain line, in front of the mountain, and was parallel to the freeway at that point. I immediately stared at it as it passed our car like we were standing still.  (we were traveling at about 75mph at the time).  It came down at about a 30\u00b0 angle then it disappe! ared out of my view.  It looked to me like it would have been pretty much right above Falcon Stadium at the Air Force Academy when it \"disappeared.\"  At that point I can\u2019t tell if it landed or it actually disappeared... it was low enough at that point that it was behind trees & buildings and I just couldn\u2019t see it anymore.  This thing was completely silent.   I\u2019ll tell ya what, it freaked me out.  I\u2019ve never seen anything like that before. I tried my best to recreate what I saw with a paintshop program.

It flew really low compared to an airplane.  It wasnt as big as a 747 it think theyre called.  But way bigger than a bird. I ran to the other side of the building to confirm but it faded form my sight.  Like it got to far away to see.  It was flying south. It had no lights, and no sound.  It seemed to just glide.  It seemed to slow to stay in the air.  For a moment I thought it was my eyes playing a trick on me but it blocked star light as it passed.

These stars or lights weren't falling out of the sky like fire works would, but moving around, sort of in formation. Looking at these lights threw my binoculars they looked exactly like the stars in the sky only moving.   I watched them move and dance around in the sky about twelve minutes until they all flew over the house and away, traveling south east.  They didn't look like UFO's.

They were up way higher than the large object and seemed to be following it.  I pointed them out to another lady who got out of her car and she said she could see them too.

My wife came outside with the camera within a minute or two, and I started filming.  I lost track of one of the objects, and for some reason, I was having trouble keeping track of the other object.

      "story": "Unknown lights chased by 2 helicopters disappear in the night sky on April 1st. I was standing outside in my back yard listening to loud music in my headphones when I heard a vibration.  I removed my headphones to get a better grasp on the location and looked and saw 2 helicopters of unknown color flying super low with only marker lights on. In front of the helicopters were 2 detached glowing lights of no particular origin.  The lights were being followed at a fast past by the choppers, and when my vision became obstructed, I lost one of the lights.  By this time, because of the low altitude, I could feel the vibrations from the choppers propellers and hear the loud engines of the choppers but could not hear any noise from the lights. As I watched the other light, unblinking by this time because of my suspicions, the light vanished into thin air, leaving the choppers to chase a wild goose.   The other witness is someone I met in the direction the lights were going. I walked up the street and saw police on the block, so I asked if they saw th! e choppers.  They said yes. I asked if they had seen what the choppers were following, and they said no, so I told them my story, which they proceeded to laugh at because of the date and the insaneness of the story.  A little further up the road, I saw a group of people standing so I asked them the same questions. Immediately after the second question, one man said, \"Yes, the light!  It just vanished!\"  He hadn't wanted to say anything about it to the others because he feared he would sound crazy.  Apparently, he caught it after the first had already disappeared because he told me he had only seen one light.   Other people acknowledge only the low flying helicopters like the police did because they only heard the noises and felt vibrations from the choppers. I'm reporting this here because I know I'm not crazy.   I love space, I follow NASA, and I know the difference between a satellite and an airplane. The lights I saw were not attached to the choppers, and if they were so! meone would have heard a bang when they fell off, being a resi! dential neighborhood near a busy street.  It is because of this fact that I thought more people would see it, but it was only myself and the other gent.",

All I could see of it was a perfect semi circle made of separate lights.  I believe it made an odd sound like a quiet helicopter but I don't specifically remember the sound.  It seemed about the size of a helicopter.   At this point I was very scared and ran back to my house as fast as possible but I believe I saw it flying off to the south after this.  It flew at a very normal speed. I don't remember all the details because afterwards I assumed it was some kind of helicopter and only recently started looking into it and found that there don't seem to be any kind of aircraft with a semicircle of lights around the front, but there are many suppsed UFO sightings described as a semicircle of lights.

      "story": "Two UFOs and one floating military plane in New Mexico. March 1980, my husband and I were on the way to the Rocky Mountain Siberian Husky Club specialty in Denver, when we stopped for gas in Colorado Springs.  It was dark, early evening when we stopped, and I was on the right side (passenger) of the car pumping gas. My husband went in to use the restroom and pay for the gas. I saw a silver, round, disk craft come into view.  The only lights it had were the row of windows that went around the middle of the craft.  It sort of floated into view as I stood there staring at it, and I remember that I was surprised that no one else seemed to see it.  It made no noise and came from the north.  It was traveling so slowly that I got a good long look at it. As it got closer to being directly in front of me, I saw a \u201cbeing\u201d standing in one of the windows. It was almost as tall as the window and seemed to be looking right at me.  I looked around again to see if anyone else was looking and they were not.  When it got directly in front of me, it gently turned and floated off to the east and disappeared off into the distance. End of story. Winter 1986, my husband was running our sled dogs up on U S Hill, southeast of Rancho de Taos.  It had been a mild winter and we had to go high to find enough snow to run on.  We were on our way back in, I was on, \u201cGus the Beast,\u201d snowmobile, and I was stopped on the north side of the mountain, just down from about 10,000 ft.  I was in the shade, sitting on the snowmobile, enjoying the peace and quiet, waiting for the team to catch up to me (I would go out in front to pack trail and be there just in case of an emergency of some kind.)  I was looking out towards Wheeler Peak when I felt a shadow go over me.  I looked up, thinking that I would see a raven \u2013 they would follow the team and often came in ahead of them \u2013 but instead, I saw a military aircraft, painted in camouflage, drifting down the valley towards Wheeler Peak.  There was NO NOISE!  It, just like the UFO in Colorado Springs, just floated away until it was out of sight. Looking at photos of aircraft, I think I must have seen the Rapture. That is as close as I can come to naming it. End of story  May 1968 I was going to The University of Albuquerque and my boy friend and I were going back to campus from a ball game near the Rio Grande Zoo.  We were on Central Avenue when I looked over towards the Country Club area, and saw a silver cigar shaped something in the sky.  I looked away and when I turned back, the trees blocked the sky.  It was a ways away, and not very big.  I doubted if I had really seen something. End of Story ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

      "story": "Multiple UFO craft, abnormal turns and accelerations and appearing from nothing and then vanishing 10-23-2015 Colorado Springs, Colorado, (Security area) UFO sighting.   Just after 4:00pm Just saw a UFO from my front yard in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as I was facing towards the South/South-East.  The flying objects were located almost straight up, thousands of feet up. (25? More?  By the time the encounter was over I had observed 4 different flying objects with the 1st morphing through three very different shapes during the encounter.  (Cigar, circle, then bell- Final shape when it disappeared between flickers)   When I noticed the first object, it caught my eye by being so white and shiny there amongst the blue backdrop of the sky with a only few high altitude clouds not far off from the fast steady moving cigar shaped craft.  It was the shape of a plane fuselage without wings and moving at high speeds across the sky with no vapor trail.  I could discern no details at this moment save the shape (cigar) and a flickering color. I watched if for a minute, it was way up there past the highest clouds, small to the naked eye. A single whitish craft with slight silvery sheen around an object that\u2019s mostly white looking although there is setting sun colored (pinky orange) flashes towards the bottom side facing the sun. (The setting sun I believe is what gave it the appearance of flickering or flashing on that side no matter what direction the craft was traveling.  It may be reflection of the setting sun upon areas of the craft as the craft spins)  (It could almost be mistaken for a plane if it were holding a steady altitude and going a normal aircraft speed which at first it was, as if mimicking a normal aircraft in speed and altitude)  So in all the cigar shaped object seemed to be flickering a weird metallic white hue about most of the craft with pink/orange flashes radiating from the bottom-front sun facing side as it moved or darted about what seems like a long ways away almost straight above my house. This thing started moving like no aircraft known to civilian science as the motions defied my minds visual knowledge of physics in action.  Everything in me screamed this motion was unnatural for machines of man.  Every cell in the core of my being knew that what I saw was not possible within my now shattered understanding of the laws of motion. This movement and motion has only been hinted at in sci-fi movies and I must say that the movements of these objects were very different than even \u2018that\u2019.  How could something survive the forces, I could only guess, were in playing upon those craft and what about the effects upon any posible biological entity. This motion from the flickering shimmering glittery pink-tinted spheres were doing some short-range fast acceleration/deceleration maneuvers, zipping and pausing and darting around almost like the motion was governed by something my mind has no concept for comparison.  Their motion was different than anything I even seen in the movies, which is what gave me such a sick odd feeling in the pit of my soul.  (I have never experienced a sensation like that, which I felt while watching these objects. Knowing I was not alone in what I saw made me feel more \u2018real\u2019 than I ever have.)  The UFO started out as one cigar shaped object flying in a straight line at very high velocity before coming to a fast stop and changing directions.  For a couple minutes it darted about instead of staying upon the course I saw it upon originally. The object moved fluidly with fast stops and starts almost like a darting hummingbird with very little curving to its flight path as you would expect from any plane or aircraft known to the US and any other nations of the world. Human craft would need to bank and arc around in a circle to change directions. This was \u2018No\u2019 plane. I have worked on many aircraft and \u2018nothing\u2019 that is not mentioned in science fiction comes close to this behavior.  These craft moved about like predatory birds dogfighting at speeds and direction changes that defy imagination. Just think of the unbelievable g-force conditions exerted. I went to the front door to call for others to come see the UFO\u2019s. When the two other witnesses showed up I pointed up to it and noticed that it was now circular shaped and fading in and out of view while hovering and appearing to dart around in a tight area. I realized the craft I relocated, \u2018This craft\u2019 was no longer cigar shaped, but circular in appearance all darting and flickering about close to the same area I last saw the original cigar shaped craft.( Did it change or was it a different craft. When I opened the house door to get someone else to see the weird objects, I lost site of the original object). It seemed to be winking in and out and hoping from being in one place to being in another close by. My mind had a hard time believing that metal could be made to move like that. These were no known manmade objects and these flying objects were real and right there in front of us all. Then, as I am pointing at it and the others are saying how weird it was moving and with everyone looking after having located the UFO, within moments, 3 more small whitish flickering UFO objects also circular and the same size as the first, appeared out of nowhere almost on top of the first. To me, at first, the first craft I saw seemed to be winking in and out, but then I started seeing two and three winking at the same time until \u20184\u2019 circular/sphere shaped flying objects seemed to appear into existence. (Listen to what I am SAYING. \u2018They\u2019, three new UFO\u2019s, just appeared, right in front of our eyes. When I say appeared, I mean that the one object was there alone. ((At least there was nothing else of interest within my visual spectrum although the jet had taken off climbing in a lazy mechanical manner flying a southerly direction with these UFO craft almost directly overhead)) It was just there alone one second and then the next second, three others start showing up, flickering in and out of visual sight.    There was no interception from the ground. I absolutely can tell you there was no craft on approach from earth. (One plane did take off from the base heading southeasterly direction with nothing in common as to shape or mannerisms. When I would glance at the plane I couldn\u2019t help but keep thinking that, \u2018THAT\u2019 was how I was taught metal was supposed to act while in flight) Now there are 4 moving around the first with 2 hovering a lot within the first ones flight path while the 3rd seemed to be chasing the first. The original would zip one direction and the 2 would move as if to block and the first one would get close and stop very abruptly, a few times they got so close they were hard to make out as 2 separate objects. The 3 new arrivals appeared to be the same size as the first. The only explanation I can think of is that they came from out of the atmosphere at unbelievable speeds from way higher up than the original UFO. This seems a lame view of what happened, as we were watching the first one, the others just showed up blinking in and out of existence before solidifying for the rest of the encounter until they vanished for good. CLOAKING? When I say they just appeared I mean they (the 3 new comers) weren\u2019t smaller looking than the 1st craft and on an intercept course until they got close enough to see them as being the same shape and size. \u2018No\u2019, these things just appeared from out of \u2018nothing\u2019. There was one, and then there were 4 with 3 flickering in and out of existence for a few seconds longer than the first before they stabilized and remained in sight. These newest three craft just showed up like they were winking in and out existence or our visual spectrum for a few seconds (like flickering fast) and then they were all within our full view. Then the block and chase maneuver started from the three newcomers. I look at the plane that took off and marveled at how the motions of the plane and the motions of the UFO\u2019s were so very in contrast with each other. Then I realized how unique my sighting was. I actually have a visual reference of one of humanity\u2019s flying machines in flight in the same area as four unknown flying objects that defy conventional motion and shattered what I took to be reality of the limits of motion and metal. I saw these objects. I saw how they were moving and seeing \u2018is\u2019 believing. \u2018I now know, \u2018that\u2019 kind of motion is possible, for I saw it and believe it to be as true as the flight of the contrasting plane. They were both there and they were both real and vastly different. I know now first hand of the limitations to our own reality and the hardwired from birth \u2018limits\u2019 set in place within our own minds. Limits upon our beliefs and what we KNOW (were taught) to be true, on what we think is the entire scope of reality, machinery, physics and motion. Wake up \u2018Please\u2019. These limits themselves have limits and are not permanent. We can wake up our misguided views of the world. I have been shown a true taste of what\u2019s possible. I know it\u2019s possible because I saw it with my own eyes. In full focused contrast against an American aircraft in flight. I liken the feeling to showing a cell phone to an old west cowboy in the early 1800\u2019s and showing that it works and that its real and there in front of him and that this tech is possible. I feel like that cowboy. Here are my comments on the aircraft: An aircraft took off around 4:15 give or take. When sight was lost on the original and only remaining UFO I went inside to check the time and it was 4:25GMT. The UFO on last location was almost straight over the house behind me now as I am facing between Cheyanne Mt. and Pikes Peak Mt. in Colorado Springs Colorado. The US Aircraft was heading south easterly where the flight paths would cross the original encounter location albeit at a far lower altitude. The plane was in no danger of collision as the UFO\u2019s altitude was far greater and they(the UFO\u2019s) were in and out of the clouds during their chase. Not in and out really just behind and peeking out from around as the cloud passed by. Visibility was excellent with very light cloud groups, very small very high up. As the Plane got further and further away the UFO objects still looked far away and above the plane\u2019s flight path. The UFO objects appeared to be staying the same size as the aircraft receded from sight and it gave me a weird kind of dual reference point from my perspective of looking at both types of craft within the same field of vision, almost straight up from my front steps facing a southeasterly direction. Then I went to get the binoculars out of the van and it was really hard to find the targets. As I was looking for them in the binoculars, the three pursuit craft just winked out first one then the other two at about the same time. The original UFO that used to be a cigar shape, when I looked at it through the binoculars, I could see a definite bell shape, that for a few seconds I thought it had flickering on and off lights. It wasn\u2019t really flickering lights on and off, It appeared to be rotating/spinning very fast with these quick flashes of pinky white glinting at the bottom corner of the craft that was facing the setting sun. The rotation was defined by a massive black form that interrupted the whiteness as it rotated. I just saw black splotch interrupting the whiteness with a much faster sunset color flickering or maybe flashing as if the sunlight was reflecting off of several objects upon the crafts side. It was a little hard to comprehend, but there were three flashes of sunset color in the bottom side that was facing the sun, per one black flash that never blacked out the overall whiteness of the object. This gave the definite appearance or rotational motion. Then with the craft in view through my binoculars, it vanished. Now try to comprehend what I am saying here. I mean, it disappeared between flickers. From one flicker to the next it just wasn\u2019t there anymore. This was the last I saw of the UFO\u2019s.",

When I opened my eyes there was a red fog engulfing the entire room.  I tried to wake my wife up but she wouldn't budge.  Not even my dog who was sleeping on the bed would wake up.  Just like a vacuum, I watched the fog get sucked out of my bedroom door (which was open).  I was extremely scared but chose to run to my front door.   There was a slight buzzing noise coming from outside (sorry I'm getting goosebumps real bad just thinking about this).  I opened the door and looked up.  Not 50 feet above the ground was a blueish chrome disk sitting almost motionless in the air.  This was at night and it's weird how I was able to see the distinct blueish chrome color of the disk.  There was a slight wobble to it also.  I felt like something was staring at me.  The disk was about 30 feet around and had a small \"base\" on top of it.  There were no lights or markings on it.  It sat there for about! a minute or two (I think but it's almost like I had been staring at it for 15 minutes) and the buzzing noise stopped.   There was a pop that came from it (there go the goosebumps again) like a balloon popping and it slowly lifted straight into the air.  When it got about I'd say 100 or so feet up it faded out of sight into nothingness.   I ran back into my house to check on my 2 year old son and he was fine.   I was able to wake my wife up and asked if she had seen anything.  She got teary eyed and without saying anything went immediately back to sleep.  My dog almost looked sad and went back to sleep as well.   This by far is the weirdest and unnerving thing I have ever witnessed in my life.  I'm am scared s**tless since last night.  While I have seen \"UFO's\" in the sky before and reported them on this site, this again by far has confirmed my belief that something else is out there.  I know I wasn't dreaming, I don't do drugs, I wasn't on any medication, nothing.  What the hell happened last night?

      "story": "The object looked to me like a soccer ball, it was round, silver colored and motionless while I watched it. My UFO Experience  This is what I saw in September of 1999.  (Exact date unknown)  I was working at the MCI building at Garden of the Gods Road and 30st Street in Colorado Springs.  It was about 8:45 to 9:00 am and I was driving my Datsun to work.  The sky was clear and blue, with no clouds to West and no noticeable wind.  I was driving West on Vindicator when I stopped in the left hand turn lane for the traffic light at Centennial Blvd.  The light had just turned red in front of me.  The red light for traffic coming from Vindicator lasts 40 seconds.  There were only a few cars on the road at that time.   As I sat there, I happened to look up toward the West.  I saw a round, soccer ball shaped object in the sky over the Mountain Shadows neighborhood.  I just stared at it for several seconds not believing what I was seeing.  I rubbed my eyes and blinked several times to make sure I was really seeing something in the sky.  The object was a light silvery color and was to the West-Southwest of where I was stopped.  The object sat there motionless for the entire time the traffic light was red and while I was watching it.  I did not see any windows or markings of any kind on this object.  My first thought was that it was a hot air balloon as the Labor Day Balloon Classic in Colorado Springs had just occurred.  But there was NO basket or harnesses hanging from or attached to this object. I tried to judge the height and distance while looking at it.  I was thinking that it was to the East of the ridge which runs on the West side of Mt. Shadows.  It looked like it was above the Western most point of the Flying W Ranch Road (which is what Vindicator turns into on the other side of Centennial).  This would be about one mile from where I was.  The height of this object seemed to be a little above the high points of the rock ridge in back of the Mt. Shadows area.  The high points in this area are a little over 7000 feet.  The intersection where I was at is a little over 6600 feet. While I was stopped at the red light watching this object, I noticed people going into and out of the Walgreen's store across the street.  Other cars were traveling on Centennial Blvd. in a normal manner.  I did not see anyone else (walking or in cars) viewing or appearing to view this object. When the light turned green for me I made my left hand turn and proceeded South down Centennial.  I don\u2019t believe that there were any cars behind me at the traffic light.  I tried to keep the object in sight, but the object was to my right and there were houses and trees along the road I was traveling.  It took about 4 minutes before I arrived in the MCI parking lot.  (I later timed this trip at 4 minutes, 15 seconds and the distance was 2.3 miles)  When I got to the MCI parking lot, I looked back toward where I had seen the object, but the sky was empty.  I looked in all directions and there was nothing.  If this had been a hot air balloon it would have still been visible to me somewhere in the sky. I don\u2019t know exactly what I saw that day, but it Was there and it was Real\u2026. At the time of the sighting I was working as a software quality assurance tester at MCI.  My occupation for the previous 40 years was as a software developer and software tester for several large aerospace companies.  My positions at these companies required me to obtain security clearances.   I was 60 years old at the time of the sighting.  I remember the object I saw as being very vivid in detail.

      "story": "Four HUGE Lights Hovering Over Colorado Springs, CO Caught on Video At approximately 8:30 pm (20:30) on October 20th, 2016, my girlfriend and I were heading North on a back road we commonly go down when I noticed a bright light in the center of my rear view mirror.  I commented on it and my girlfriend said that it was probably just a plane as we live near an air force academy.  I agreed but kept watching as a second bright light appeared next to it, then a third and the final fourth light.  I immediately did a U-turn so we can get a better look and watched for about five minutes while driving towards it. It should be noted at this point that the lights were off in the distance directly over the city lights.  My girlfriend started recording the lights with her phone and one by one the lights started disappearing as if they were never there until the last one faded out. I uploaded the video of the lights to YouTube where I explain in text everything I have outlined here and explain that we know a plane or aircraft when we see one and this is definitely not just a plane.  I should also add that each light went out about twenty seconds after the previous one.  I don't know if this is frowned upon but the link to the video is provided below.

The helicopter climbed and sped up to match altitude and speed of the light.  The light disappeared from our view.

I took my dog out for an early-morning potty. While standing there, I looked up in the area of the star Vega.  I must have been staring only a minute when a whitish-blue pulsating light appeared. This UFO light continued to do this pulsating scenario about eight times before completely vanishing. This light was absolutely silent and went from North to South, then North again; then completing a half circle.  My dog seemed to look up in the direction a few seconds before I visually could see the lights. About a minute into watching this UFO's lights, I could see an airplane's silhouette (which was flying from West to North East). Judging distance and size  comparison, the lights of the UFOs at their brightest were approximately the same diameter as the airplane. The total duration in which I can see the strange lights what is approximately 5 minutes. I ran inside so I could write down everything I could remember seeing, then text my husband at work  telling him that I saw something strange. I downloaded multiple sky apps on my phone and the next day tried to go out at the exact same time, 3:10am in the morning to see if I saw anything similar happening again, which I didn't. However, what was interesting is on this particular app you could rewind the time to see if there were any flares, overhead  satellites, radio satellites or the ISS passing overhead during the specific time I recalled watching the unidentified lights. As far as I could research, nothing showed up as far as anything that would be linked to man-made light anomalies.  Our family has had several sightings over many lifetimes, and being that I grew up over 43 years in this city, I can say I've never witnessed lights in the sky such as this.   There did seem to be an intelligence behind the lights, however nothing that made me feel alarmed.  Nonetheless, my heart rate spiked and I was a bit creeped out.",

We took 9 photos over a 5 minutes period, between 11:46 am and 11:51 am Mountain Time.  Our home has an excellent view of Pikes Peak, the mountain range west of the city and we frequently take weather photos. We reviewed the photos a few hours later and first noticed the anomalous dark image in the second picture taken at 11:47 am.  It was taken with a Motorola Droid Turbo 2 smartphone.  What\u2019s ironic is that, when taking the photo, we saw a long cloud formation over the southern flank of mountains and I said aloud in jest \u201cthat looks like a mother ship\u201d.   The anomalous dark object is above and to the left of the long cloud formation in the photo.  The dark object is a bit blurry but obvious to the eye.  No other photos taken have shown anything unusual, apart from the small cloud formations which quickly formed in an otherwise clear sky and then dissipated after the solar eclipse. We\u2019re used to seeing large birds, planes, helicopters, even drones, fly the skies in our area.

Someone had a car radio on listening to a station reporting the strange sight we were looking at. As I watched in awe, I noticed there were red, white & either blue or green lights blinking and rotating all around this craft (I can\u2019t be certain on the blue or green colors after all these years).  It seemed as if \u201cthey\u201d were trying to communicate with us.  Then I noticed three other circular objects off in the distance, they were \u201cdarting\u201d back & forth at a high rate of speed, as in the blink of an eye.  Everyone around me remarked about what we were watching, no one had seen anything like this before. This show went on for almost an hour before the three smaller spacecraft disappeared. The larger spacecraft left shortly after that. All of them left at a high rate of speed, much faster than anything we had ever seen. Since there were about a dozen or more people watching this show, and many more listening to the radio, seeing the same thing we did, it had to be newsworthy!

I could tell that this was pretty far away and too large to be a drone at this distance.  At first glance I did not think anything of what I thought was a bright star appearing at sunset, after maybe only 2 or 3 seconds of first glance while the original \"light\" (what I though was a star) was stationary in the sky another light appeared directly to the left of the original light.  This second light then stopped at a some distance to the left of the original light.  The second light first appeared at the halfway point between where the original light was and where the second light stopped and remained stationary.  I could not tell if the second light originated from the first light because it was first seen at the midway point.   The second light did however travel from the midway point to the left of the original light.  When the second light stopped, there was a third light that then did the same thing, starting some distance to the left of the second light, travel a distance to the left and then stopped.  As soon as the third light appeared, the first light then disappeared.  However, the first and the third light did co-exist for roughly 1 second.  Process then repeated around 8 or 9 times in a perfect horizontal direction over roughly 10 to 15 seconds.  I could not see the lights past that point because of trees and buildings.   The lights appeared around twice the size and brightness of a normal star and moved in a perfect sequence of disappearing and reappearing lights with a \"middle light\" always present during the sequence.  This also happened over a great distance and eventually left my visibility.",

I was staying at a hotel near I-25 and Circle Dr.  This hotel had patios and balconies for smokers or people who just wanted to sit outside.  The room I stayed in was on the first floor, near the tennis/basketball courts.   Anyway, I had just gotten back from having dinner with a friend of mine and I was starting to wind down for the night.  The drive down there from Denver was horrible because we encountered major storms earlier in the day.  Lots of heavy rains and hail from Denver to the Sprgs.  So I decided to go out on the patio and have a smoke or two before I went to bed. I was out there for about 5 or 10 mins, when I suddenly saw a white translucent chevron aircraft flying silently to the South/Southwest.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  I have never seen one of these objects before.  It was flying around 2000-3000 ft. up in the air and it was moving very fast.  Unfortunately, there was a large tree close to where I was standing and the object flew behind the tree and I didn't see it again. As soon as I noticed it was gone for good, I noticed several perfect circles (a bit larger than basketballs) that were also white and translucent that were much lower in the sky, and they were much closer to me and my position!  At first, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I started to rub them.  But as soon as I stopped rubbing them, I saw more of the white circles just hovering in the air. There were people playing tennis that night and there were other people on one of the other courts because I could hear them being really loud and laughing about something, but I didn't know what.  I didn't get the impression that any of them saw what I just saw, but I don't know for sure.  I did not sleep well that night at all and I kept getting the impression that something was watching me.  It was so creepy!  I have had numerous UFO sightings over the past 21 years, but I've never seen anything like these objects.",

      "story": "Date of Incident: 02/13/2018 Summary of Incident: At approximately 20:05 hours, as I was entering the parking lot to the rear of my place of employment located in the Interquest Parkway and I25 area in Northern Colorado Springs, I was performing my normal visual security sweep to ensure it was safe to approach my parked vehicle.  This is a normal procedure I find myself doing on my late shift nights, especially when it is dark. Having used my small flashlight and having identified no immediate danger I cautiously started walking towards my car when, out the corner of my eye and to the right, I picked up something that looked like bright lights or a fire towards the southwest area of town near Fort Carson and/or Cheyenne Mountain AFB.  Turning my head to get a better look I saw what appeared to be a bright string of amber colored flare like lights that at times appeared connected and at times with gaps between them.  At first I thought they may have been aerial flares or illumination rounds fired from the artillery ranges at Fort Carson.   However, I quickly determined that they were not acting like flares and too high to be \u2018Illum\u2019 rounds.  In fact, they appeared to flicker in and out by disappearing and reappearing for lack of a better explanation. As I looked harder, it appeared that these lights were above the flashing antenna lights on the very top of Cheyenne Mountain.  I could not quite put together in my head what I was actually seeing and could not fully determine if the object was actually one or many items and if it was moving or spinning (from possibly right to left) or if there was an illusion of movement due to its flickering nature. Suddenly after about a minute or less of this, the object or objects suddenly disappeared and did not come back.  I saw one of my coworkers getting into her car nearby and I yelled out if she just saw that to which she replied she did and made some half joking comment about a flying saucer.  My whole drive home, which was 12 miles in a southerly direction down Powers Blvd, I made sure to keepe an eye out on the sky, however, I never saw them again. At around 20:55 hours, from home, I called a local new station\u2019s news desk, KKTV I believe, and spoke with someone named  Tony and asked him if anyone had called in reporting a string of amber colored lights in the sky. He immediately became excited at stated I was the first report from Colorado Springs and that he has been getting reports of such a thing for the past hour from Pueblo which is just south of Colorado Springs.  He even volunteered that he was going to call NORAD and ask them if anything was going on and that someone had even sent video which he intended to put on the station\u2019s Facebook page. As of the following morning, there were no news reports or video.  I talked to my coworker and she stated that she saw the same thing I did and added that the incident seemed to cause the antenna lights on top of Cheyenne Mountain to flicker on and off, something I did not, myself, seem to pick up on. I am a veteran of the US Army and former law enforcement.  I have seen numerous aircraft and aerial flares over the years and can positively state I have never seen anything quite like this.  However, I am open to the possibility that this sighting could be due to military aircraft and/or flares. The lights were bright and amber colored, much larger than stars but smaller, although brighter, than the moon.   There was a slight wind where I was at but I do not know what the weather was like in the area where the lights were. Postscript: I have waited over a year to post this and was on the fence, so to speak, about doing it at all for reasons personal to me.  However, 3 recent Joe Rogan podcasts have changed my mind.",

      "story": "Early in the morning of October 4th 2019 around 4am I was letting my dogs out in the backyard.  Per usual I was looking up at the sky when I saw a large object seemingly hovering around in the same spot.  There was a weird light zipping around the object that I was able to get on video. When looking up at the sky there was an object that seemed quite large hovering in a small area. There were several lights around the bottom of the object which is how I was able to see it slightly moving in sort of a circle.  I assumed, at first, that it was a plane, but as I stood there it didn't seem to be really going anywhere.  It seemed to be very high up above the clouds, though it still seemed quite large. I decided to try to film what was going on with my phone. It couldn't quite pick up the large object even zoomed in as far as it would go.  It did, though, pick up a strange white light that seemed to just be zipping around the sky around the larger object.  This object moved very quickly in a random pattern back and forth around the larger object.  It seemed to almost disappear for a super brief period and then it would reappear on the other side of the larger object in the blink of an eye. As I said, I did get it on video and have watched it several times and even had my husband and sister watch it and we cannot figure out what could be moving around in such a way.  I don't want to just jump to UFO, but I cannot come up with any other explanation. If there was something that was going on at this time of morning in the sky I haven't been able to find it when googling for possible answers.",

      "story": "Multiple Lights moving outside our Colorado house for the 2nd night in a row. This was the second night in a row we witnessed these lights. My fiance filed one on the 15th. We only noticed the one ufo then, but had speculated there may have been more than one. Last night we witnessed at least 3. The light was once again very subtly moving and changing colors (I saw purple/green/red at various times). There was an instance where a plane or jet flew over the object and it then began to rapidly change colors. I also noticed the light rotate to a point where I was able to make out a bit of a shape. I saw a triangle, though my perception honestly could have been off. I took some video with my phone. This was a particularly starry night. I didn't think I'd be able to catch anything since normally my iPhone can't pick-up the stars at night as the camera is only so good. It did catch this light though and the movements I was catching was truly extraordinary. It was blinking/flashing and moving at speeds/in directions I've never seen any norma! l aircraft moved. It almost looked like something you would see in a video game/computer. Almost like a mouse cursor moving. The main light we saw was to the southwest. At some point while I was recording this light, my fiance alerted me to another UFO just to the Southeast at a bit of a higher elevation. This light was a bit more stationary, but had many similarities to the light I was recording. After we had gone back inside, about an hour later at 2:30 AM, my fiance called me into the kitchen to show me another light to the northeast of our house. I took some more video from my office window at the back of the house and once again I captured it doing some more movements. Unsure what these are but at least one of them gave us the distinct impression that it was investigating or searching for something.",

      "story": "Changes shape, rotates, changes colors, does not move the way any airplane moves. This is the 2nd time I saw something similar to what I saw in the summer of 2008 in Indiana. My fiance went outside to put trash to the curb, came back inside to tell me to check this blue light out in the northwest sky. He knew it wasn't a planet, wasn't a bright star, and didn't look like any sort of plane. A plane actually went by it, I'm sure miles apart in the sky, but from our perspective it was a couple feet. It doesn't seem like something the military would make because of the way it moved. It was a bright star similar to how bright Venus and Mars is, but it changed to red and blue, which at first we thought was an airplane, but it kept spinning in circles as if it was searching for something, when it was moving to the right it would become elliptical- like it was stretching, moved really slow, hovered and spun around and around. It would slowly move back and forth, up and down. It even made a zig-zag pattern in the shape of an S, my mom and daughter came out, while it was harder for our daughter to detect the movement, my mother saw it. And was shock no F-16 were up there investigating it. It even got dimmer at one point. And my fiance just checked it again now (01:17) and its further to the right of where it was when we first saw it. We were going to use our daughter's telescope- but couldn't find all the pieces we needed to get a closer look.",
