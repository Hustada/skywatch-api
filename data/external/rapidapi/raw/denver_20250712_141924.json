      "story": "six objects changing formation for about 10 minutes above the Denver Metro Area, mid day. May 24, 2019, Appox. 12:30pm  1 Mile west of downtown Denver, Colorado, (32nd Ave & King Street)   \tToday, May 24, 2019, about a mile due west of Denver Colorado.  It is a day with almost no clouds and bright sunshine.  I was standing outside talking with my neighbors when I noticed 6 objects to the NNE.  The objects were at a 50-60 degree angle from my location.  These objects were simply just there.  From my location they had the appearance of an object between a baseball and a golf ball.  Planes were passing over headed to the local airport, Denver International Airport that fly at approx. 12,000\u2019, less than a mile above the ground, as they have just passed over 12-14,000\u2019 foot mountains and begin decent for landing.  A private plane passed over at no more than 2000\u2019 feet above so my guess is they were 3-4000\u2019 above the ground. \tMy first thought is that these were balloons that had been released, as today is the last day of school.  The objects would have been too large to be balloons and they stayed in the same relative altitude.  Next, I thought they might be birds as they were constantly changing formations.  The idea being they were trying to gain altitude.  They moved from V to diamond to non-formation and back in a constant shifting of their position relative to each other. \tThis was not birds or balloons.  First, their size would have been too big for a bird and while I thought I saw a wing, given the size of a bird and distance it was away a wing would not be possible to see.  Even White Trumpeter Swans would be smaller, they are exceedingly rare in this part of the US and don\u2019t fly in the manner that I witnessed.  They also reflected light of a white translucent color with a hint of rainbow sheen leaning heavier towards the red spectrum.  Birds don\u2019t reflect light, which is why my mind first turned to balloons, but again the size was too large.  They had to be rather large in size . They appeared to be flying in an erratic behavior at first glance, much like balloons, but it soon became apparent these were flying in a controlled manner and altering between multiple formations. I was with two neighbors who took no interest, and I\u2019m not sure if they could see them.  I was wearing sunglasses and when I removed my glasses, I was unable to see the objects. They were not wearing any sunglasses (and chuckled at my reference to the objects being extraordinary).  My I-Phone was unable to pick up anything either.  The objects were clearly reflecting light which changed as they moved, giving the impression they were possibly spinning.  The reflecting was not bright enough to overcome the sun\u2019s glare without sunglasses. This went on for about 10 minutes.  I turned my eyes away for a moment and when looked back they were simply gone.  I waited about 30-45 minutes to gather my thoughts and then began this reporting process.",

      "story": "Erratically moving light fading inconsistently in and out above Denver While in our backyard enjoying an evening fire, we noticed a bright light moving from the south, but the light was fading in and out at an inconsistent rate, sometimes fading, sometimes blinking in and out.  As we watched the light moving, it began to slow down, and began moving erratically.  After about 10 minutes, it seemed to turn east, and while its movement east was not consistent, it remained on that general course, the light fading in and out/blinking in and out the entire time.  It finally grew too distant to see.  This was definitely not an aircraft, since the fading/blinking was not consistent like an aircraft's warning lights, and was also only white, no green or red light detectable.  The intensity of the light when it was at its brightest reminded me of a satellite when the sun catches it just right, perhaps even brighter.  We did wonder if this was the reported asteroid that was supposed to be at its closest approach tonight, given the inconsistent brightness, but the fact that it fairly quickly changed course to the east, and did not travel in a straight line makes it difficult to pin down.   We do have about 3 minutes of cellphone video of the event, with another star visible for reference.",

      "story": "Independent confirmation of a previously reported sighting of a UFO of Denver, CO. I am confirming a previous report of an object seen over Denver, CO on 4/16/2004. I was working as an armed security guard at a Denver hospital clinic. I stepped outside for my normal check of the perimeter of the building, and I witnessed the same object as previously reported at that time and date. The sky was blue and clear, and I saw a bright silver object moving quickly at a very high altitude from East to West at about 80 degrees from the horizon.  At first I thought it might be a high altitude military craft, or daytime satellite, but it abruptly stopped, and stayed in a stationary position. I retrieved a pair of 10x50mm binoculars from my car, and I was barely able to identify the object as what appeared to be a silver spinning cylinder. It was spinning very fast vertically, end over end, and was completely stationary. I asked a patient outside the clinic if she would confirm what I was seeing, and her response was, quote: \u201cWhat in the world is that???\u201d. The object was stationary for approximately 20 minutes, and at one point, a high flying (40,000ft?) commercial jetliner flew underneath, yet the altitude of this strange object was still much higher than the jetliner. I would venture to guess its altitude was on the order of 65,000+ft. To be able to distinguish it as a spinning cylinder at that altitude, leads me to think that it must have been huge. After 20min the spinning cylinder gained altitude and sped away at extreme speed to the North, until it quickly disappeared. Being an experienced amateur astronomer, I have seen quite a variety of objects both day and night. I have previously always been able to eventually identify and classify the objects as either spy satellites, the space station, space shuttle, weather balloons, or other man made aircraft, etc. The sighting and behavior of this object has bothered and bewildered me for years, and I am glad I finally found an appropriate place to tell my story, and confirm that it was witnessed by several other people. My conclusion, after all of these years, is that this was a genuine UFO, and that even the most advanced secret! militar y craft in the world could not have flown or behaved the way this one did\u2026",

      "story": "Viewed a silent, grey, shape shifting ufo fly over the nearby Denver Pepsi Center at 9:36pm. My room mate and I were walking from Capital Hill to the Starz Theatre, next to the Denver Pepsi Center to see an advance screening of \"Lions for Lambs\".  We are about 5 minutes from the theater when I first noticed  a strange looking object flying overhead.  It was around 9:36pm and the sky was getting dark enough to see the FAA lights on the aircraft, but still bright enough to make out the shape of nearby helicopters and airplanes coming from the nearby Denver International Airport. The object appeared gray in color, no lights, no visible vapor trails, and no sound emitting from the object. It caught my attention because after looking at the flying object for a few seconds, I realized I couldn't pinpoint what type of flying craft it was.  It seemed to look as if though it was flying in a straight motion, but had the appearance it was rotating and changing its position within the flight path. At one moment I thought I could see wings, but it would quickly change into an unrecognizable shape. I also thought that it could have been a bunch of balloons banded together, but i've seen those before. And helium balloons travel upward, this object was traveling in a \"straight\" pattern, never escalating its height. Another odd factor was that caught my attention was that it was not making any sound. I'd say it was maybe 700-750ft off of the ground, close enough to be able to hear an aircraft sound. I would know that, because other aircraft pass overhead at much higher alltitudes in Denver, and the sounds are easily distinguishable during the time the object was witnessed. And I say 700ft, because the largest building in Denver is the Republic Plaza, which is at 714\"ft. And this object was definitely within that range.. The Object traveled silently , and eventually just disappeared out of site. That too seemed also a little strange, because the visibility was still clear enough to see aircraft coming too and from the nearby Rocky Mountains. However this craft seem to loose visibility. As it would move farther, the shape would also still keep changing. This will have been my second time seeing UFO in two different States.",

PD))  Distant white spheres seen by crowd on college campus I was attending the Stan Romanek presentation at St Cajetan's Church on the Auraria Campus near downtown Denver. Shortly after 4:00 PM (4:15?) a break was called (the program ran from 2PM to 6PM). Many people, including me, went outside. It was a very nice day, mild (in the 40's), partly sunny, very light breeze. I just looked at the sky casually, but then I noticed a lot of people were looking and pointing and yelling about something in the sky. They were all looking north or northwest. I asked someone to point them out to me; it took me about 30 seconds to notice them for myself. They appeared to be white. Most people said they looked like spheres (in fact, some said they were PERFECT spheres) but to me they looked more flattened, like a disc would look; however, I wear glasses and my prescription is 4 years old and I know I don't have 20/20 vision with them anymore. A few people had cameras or cell phones with cameras and were trying to take pictures. I saw that one person has already posted their report and included 3 photos. They do look more rounded in the photos, so it was probably my eyesight that made them look more flattened somehow. A couple of people thought they were balloons, but I did not think so for 2 reasons. First, they did not drift together in the same direction like balloons would be if carried by the wind. They would change direction, go into and out of clouds, and move in opposite directions to one another and stop and hover, then move again. There were 3 or 4 initially, then only 2, then only 1. Then I went back inside because the program was to resume. Either the other objects took off so fast I couldn't see them, or they disappeared, or went behind a cloud or two. Stan was outside for a few minutes and also saw them but said it was hard to tell whether \"they\" were there for him and the crowd, or whether it was balloons or whatever; he didn't watch them for long and went back inside. He asked the crowd later how many people saw the objects and a lot of hands wen! t up, pr obably more people saw them than didn't. Last summer at the UFO Watchtower, where Stan also was, there was a similar looking sighting--bright white color, very distant and high in the sky.",

      "story": "A supposed star, at a time before there were humanly created objects in orbit, which behaved very differently from the other stars. In July of 1957, I was a cadet at the Air Force Academy which was then located at the temporary site at Lowry Air Force Base on the outskirts of Denver.  At the time of the sighting, I was taking practice celestial fixes pursuant to becoming an Air Force navigator. The exact date escapes me, but it was in July.  There were celestial navigation trainers in the quadrangle, small enclosures with astrodomes inside, that each of us used with a bubble sextant hung from an astrodome.  The sextants were 1.5 power and were pre-set by the student for azimuth and elevation.  Once the settings were in the sextant, the student would look into the eyepiece and choose the brightest star in the field to set the sextant crosshairs and hold them there for two minutes.  The two minutes was necessary for the sextant averager to arrive at the proper elevation for the precomputed time of the shot. On this night, I had precomputed a shot for Kochab in the Little Dipper, set the proper azimuth and elevation into the sextant, and had set the crosshairs on the bright star in the field.  I began the shot and was adjusting the elevation as the averager was ticking away. The \"star\" I was shooting held firm with other stars in the field for about half  minute. Then I noticed that the azimuth and elevation were changing in excess of what was usual and could see that the supposed star was changing location relative to the other stars in the field.  I took my eye from the eyepiece and watched the \"star\" slowly moving to the right and slightly downward in relation to the other stars. There were two other cadets in the trainer precomputing for a shot.  I tried to show them the \"star\", but they could not easily see it among the other stars and it was moving too slowly for them to notice it easily - so they lost interest quickly and never saw what I was attempting to show them.  I was not excited because the nothing exciting seemed to be happening.  Consequently, the other cadets went back to what they had been doing. I watched the \"star\" continuing to move for a distance of about ten degrees across the sky (perhaps it was less) and then it stopped and just stayed in place with the other stars once more.  I continued to watch the \"star\" for several minutes and checked its location again before I left the trainer (at least a half hour later).  The object never moved again during this time relative the other stars. I thought about this for some time.  I never reported it.  This was before there was ever even a Sputnik.  Later, in the Air Force, I learned of many UFO sightings that were never reported (reporting them was unwise at the time), and I began to think that what I had seen was a \"mother ship\" changing its solar orbit (otherwise, it would have been moving all the time).",

DIA airport faces in the same direction, so always see when planes when they are coming and landing\u2026 but this was most definitely no plane.  I saw a light that would have looked like a twinkling star, except for a triangular shaped bright-aura surrounding it.  It was hovering above ground a couple hundred feet for a few seconds, and then shot up higher into the sky faster than any aircraft I\u2019ve ever seen. Then it slowed down, did a zigzag up higher while going north, then disappeared.  I went inside immediately and sat down, a little disturbed by what I saw to make sense of anything.  I went back outside after a few minutes to see if the people who had also spotted it were still there, but they had left.

What struck me was that it was extremely faint, so short (less than 2 moon widths) and that it had a slight \u201cj\u201d hook to the east. This was at about 10-20 degrees SSW of the zenith. 4)  \tTotal sightig--about 1 second.  II. UFO  1)  \tFollowing the trajectory of the micrometeoroid flash (contrail?), within  a second or so and starting about 10 degrees due south, I saw an object moving across the star field at an apparent high altitude, squareish, with a cluster of lights centrally located within the square (perhaps a violet and a white light, extremely faint, and perhaps 1-2 others). 2)  \tThe object at first moved generally east toward Cygnus, shifting erratically back and forth at 90 degrees, while jumping erratically 5+ degrees north and south, instantaneously. 3)  \tThe object appeared to maintain the same altitude throughout the sighting, and was less than \u00bc of a moon width. It finally disappeared to the SE into the glare of the cloud over Parker, and I waited to see if it appeared under the cloud--it didn\u2019t. 4)  \tTotal sighting- about 7 seconds.  III. Personal notes  1)\tI\u2019ve been a sky gazing hobbyist for over 45 years (I\u2019m 54 now), and I know what to look for in the constellations. 2)\tI\u2019m a veteran of seven archaeological projects including a survey, and am used to looking quickly for unusual detail (20:13 vision). 3)\tExcept for some inconsistencies with the Nasca features and the nearby hill theory, or an occasional mutilation that goes against the predator theory, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m pretty much a \u201cSkeptical Inquirer\u201d type.

The object was just east of Denver at what seemed to be 40 to 50 thousand feet and was moving north to northeast.  4 to 5 smaller lights appeard behind the main object at even spacing, and maintained the same altitude and speed as the lead object.  I asked Denver Center (Air Traffic Control) if they had traffic at my 9 o'clock high. They replied negative. I said \"maybe it's space junk burning up\" but another airliner on frequency said no, it was moving too horizontal and did not have a trail of burning debris.  I agreed. The lights went out as they moved off to the north and east.  I've seen many meteors while flying and this was not a meteor.  It was not a conventional aircraft as it had no positon, strobe, or anti-colllision lights.  I have 17,000+ hours of flying time over 40 years.  I'm a Captain at a major airline and a retired USAFR Lt Col fighter pilot. This event was unlike anything I've ever seen.

I believe this may be of the same type my family saw flying in close (20 feet) formation above Westerly Creek park 2 summers ago-those two had silvery bottoms and straight leading edge, forward sweeping trailing edge wings.

This experience gave me the knowledge and encouragement to become a leader in the aerospace science and international airline spaceline operations. By the grace of God I currently lead the industry as the developer of a spaceship that competed successfully in the 2004 X-Prize race to space for civilian operators. My sisters possessed this same general background in aviation to confirm that what she saw flying object just below the clouds headed directly south as if head toward Colorado Springs Colorado. While looking up into the local airspace of an extremely located south east Denver neighborhood she observed  a new type of flying ship that was shaped like a open \"V\" apexes first configuration and moving very fast while making no sound emissions at about 5:30 pm. Because of its smaller size, as compared to a major airliner, she believes that the object, which flew directly over her head at about a 90 degrees zenith point could have possible been a large UVA, CUVA or single piloted craft. What captured  her attention was the fact that  the flying machine was following an  unconventional flight route that deviated from the normal east/west ATC regulated  traffic patterns class D airspace  routing support for both DIA and our Buckley AFB  flight patterns. She observed white lights illuminate near the outer section of both delta wing tip leading edges and possessed no power-plant thrust production smoke or vapors trailing it as it few at a low altitude. She does not remember the exact day but it was seen early last week around the 2ed of October. One final note in relation to this strange sighting its interesting to note that the sighting was made just before the North Korea nuclear boom test firing event schedule which place America\u2019s spying activities on full alert. My sister know her airplane and I believe what she saw was something new. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))",

      "story": "Triangle like object appears, lands then dissapears near littleton hospital My friends and I were out for a drive in the South Broadway/Hampton area when all of a sudden we saw what appeared to be two planes flying extremley low to the ground. Upon further inspection, we noticed that the \"planes\" were connected to eachother by a beam of light, and that what we had thought to be the triad pattern of lights often seen on planes at night was acutally a part of this strange object. The best possible description of its appearence is that it was one larger triangular shape lined with red and blue lights connected to a similar but smaller triangular shape. It moved very fast and sparatically making no noise at all. It was able to turn very sharply. The larger and smaller triangular components of the object always moved relative to eachother, maintaining a perfect connection.  After aproximatley two minutes of what appeared to be random motion, the object suddenly flew away into the distance until it was no longer visible. At this point, my friends and I were positive that what we saw was not a plane/helicopter/weather ballon due to the apparent high velocity the object was able to reach in such a short amount of time, and the complexity of its movement. My emotions at this time were shock, excitement, and amazement of what I had just seen. After the object had been gone for about 6 minutes, it suddenly reappeared very close to us, approximatly 50 yards above our car. After flying around the area for for about a minute, the object came to an abrupt stop above a residential area, about four blocks away from our car. At this point, we stopped the car and I was able to get a better look at the object. The \"light beam\" connection was actually a very well lit solid connection and dark window shapes could be made out on the smaller of the two triangles. I glanced down the street and noticed that several other cars had stopped to observe the object as well. After it hovered for a few seconds, it began to descend and landed on the ground. We immediatley tried to drive to where ! it had l anded, but could not find anything. The object had apparently dissapeared or become invisible upon landing. We searced the area where it appeared to have landed intensly for about a half and hour but could find nothing. Three helicopters arrived and appeared to be activley searching during the this time, and for the remainder of the night we could see/hear helicopters near the area of the sighting. Throughout the entire sighting I never felt afraid, I just felt amazed beyond belief and lucky to have seen this object.",

I know this may sound somewhat ridiculous with most of the media attention surrounding the city of Denver with the DNC and all, but I had to report this. This is my second confirmed UFO sighting of an uknown object here in Denver. These are also my first 2 UFO sightings I have ever encountered. I was watching CNN coverage of the political candidates. I had just finished dinner as I had gotten off at work around 6pm. I walk to and from my office, so I always am on the lookout for anything flying by in the sky, as there always is something to look at. I live on the 3rd floor in my apartment, so I have a pretty good view of the nearby republic plaza, capital building, etc. The skies were clear, the sun was shining through my windows, so I had closed a few blinds, but left 2 open.  I had just finished my dinner while watching CNN news, with a Bill Richardson interview.  I noticed something start to pass by in my left window facing the capital. I see helicopters planes, balloons,and birds pass by all the time, but this looked very strange. What caught my attention quickly was that there was no sound. When something that close flies by, I always hear it coming.  I quickly glanced at the dark object and noticed immediately that it wasn't a plane, helicopter, or balloon. At first I couldn't pinpoint the exact shape, but it seemed to be wobbling, and tipping up and down in that motion.  It was hard to glance at with the sun shinning directly on my view, but I could make out the elliptical, disc shape as it appeared to continue its path of flight across the downtown area. The Object's distance from the ground couldn't have been more than 1,000 ft, possibly even less. It continued to fly North, at a steady speed in the same wobbly, tilting motion. It had given the impression as if it was spinning, and I knew immediately it was a saucer shaped craft when the bottom portion came it to view as it flew further away from the capital hill viewing area.  I cannot determine the speed, but it seemed to be flying at a steady pace, similar to a police / black hawk helicopter.  However, the object seemed to speed up and quickly went out of site in the distance. The only image capturing device I have is a cell phone camera, and that yielded no results, however it does provide a concept of where the object was when the picture was taken, and the time of day. I am not sure if anyone else had seen this, or noticed it going by.  There had to be individuals that had seen this from the ground. Anyone going to and from the 16th Mall downtown had to have a view. I am eager to know if anyone else seen this strange object.  Not sure if the military is flying drones of some sort around the city, or if this was some weird kind of civilian aircraft, but this was definitely not an object being controlled by wind. Weather.com had the winds at 10mph from S,SE during the time of sighting.  This object was traveling way to fast, and at varied elevation increments throughout its path; to be mistaken for any kind of balloon or bag. I'm not saying its an alien spacecraft, but this was definitely something out of the norm. There has to be some explanation of what the object was.",

The object seemed to stay in one place and then slowly move in a linear fashion.  Not anything like any aircraft.  The object then appeared to start flashing different colors. It would flash a bright red, then bright green, bright blue, and yellow and then back to white in no particular order.  It seemed like the entire object donned the color that it turned to, much unlike blinking aircraft lights that are separated by wing space.  As the object turned different colors it seemed to hover in one place.  It would then slowly do a somewhat figure eight pattern or a circular movement pattern and would at instances seemingly accelerate very quickly and then slow back down and then just hover in place.

A few minutes after the sighting, a jet with a short stream was seen flying to where the objects were spotted in the sky.  I lost sight of it when it disappeared behind the same cloud as the UFO.

There were three lights in a \u201cV\u201d formation which were pale blue in color, and the outer two lights kept changing in their intensity - \u201ctwinkling\u201d in unison, while the center light at the tip of the \u201cv\u201d remained stable.   Because Denver International Airport is nearby, we thought at first the lights might belong to commercial or private aircraft -- but on closer observation we noticed there were no regulation aviation strobes.   Also, the lights hovered in the same location for the entire 15 minutes we watched.   We went indoors when the cold finally got to us and tried to find a window from which they were visible, but trees blocked our view.",

On Saturday May 15, 2010 I was standing in James Bible Park in Denver, CO looking at the moon and Venus which were spectacular when I looked up and noticed off the cup end of the Big Dipper a light just appeared and began to travel in a northbound direction.  It disappeared and reappeared three times before I lost it.  Then 10 minutes later I noticed two more. One was travelling southeast and the other (which I estimate to be about 5 times the brightness of Venus was travelling northeast. It appeared as though both craft were going to collide right over my head but they just missed each other.  I listened for the sound of aircraft but heard nothing.  Furthermore there were no clouds in the sky.  At this point I dialed 911 just to have an official reporting.  Then as I was on the phone I saw a fourth one appear.  It looked to me like it was following an aircraft that I noticed was far out in front of the light (maybe a mile).  I watched the light until it disappeared! and described it all to the dispatcher at 911.  By this time it was about 22:00 hours and I called my mom and her boyfriend who came out to bring me a coat and watch with me.  At approximately 23:00 hours we saw another one very similar to the first.  It appeared out of thin air directly over head moved around for about 30 seconds and then disappeared.

The purpose of the visit was to borrow his video camera in the hopes that I'd catch some of what I'd seen the previous evening on video. I was leaving his house with the camera when I looked up North in the sky and saw something appear in the sky seemingly out of nowhere. I can't be certain how to describe its movement but it was similar to that of a jellyfish. After about 30 seconds a second one appeared. I hollered to matt who came out on his balcony and confirmed what I thought I was seeing. They began to move in a easterly direction. Sometimes appearing to drift and at other times they looked to be propelling themselves. It\u2019s important to note neither object drifted the same way as the wind or clouds. We watched them for about 15 minutes until they were out of sight. At that moment a plane that looked very similar to an airliner but painted all black or b! lue on the bottom swooped through from east to west at about 500 feet in altitude right where I had first seen the ufos. Then directly after the plane swooped through Matt began hollering to look directly up in the sky. Over head and very high we saw a number of lights blinking on and off and dancing around. This persisted for another half hour. Also I noticed cotton like substance falling from the sky. I collected some of the material and am hoping have it analyzed. It was very hard to catch these objects with the video camera I was using but I did capture one of them for a brief moment. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source in Denver.

Her home is located in the central Denver area in the 80204 zip code.   As we were preparing to enter her home, she mentioned that the stronger than normal winds that the Denver metro area experienced had cleared the pollution and made the stars appear brighter.   As she mentioned the clearer night sky, we looked up, initially to the south.   As we looked up, a brighter light caught our attention approaching from the southeast moving towards the northwest.   The light initially appeared to be a shooting star, but was not as vibrant as a star and not moving as rapid as a shooting star either.   As the light moved over our heads heading towards the northwest, it appeared to be not just one light, but a group of about six lights in the shape of the letter V, or very similar to birds flying in a group.  The shape of the V formation was not perfectly symmetrical like you would see from lights on the tips of a commercial airplane. It took approximately 20 seconds for the lights to appear and to move out of sight towards the northwest.   The lights were not as bright as the lights that are on a commercial airplane.  In addition, there was absolutely no sound.   If these lights were coming from a jet or a commercial airplane, it would have to make sound moving at that speed which it did not.  Also, the lights were moving below the clouds in the sky as the clouds did not impede the lights as they moved across the sky.  The lights continued to move towards the northwest until they were no longer visible leaving no sound.",

To give perspective, we were on 43rd and Decatur. What caught our eye was that there were no running lights on this vehicle (I am not a pilot, but I think it is a big no-no to fly through the city without any lights on, but I may be wrong).  As it approached from the west, traveling about the speed of a helicopter or small plane, we kept waiting to hear some kind of engine noise to help us know what we were seeing (Police helicopter, Traffic reporter, etc).  We never heard any sound. Since we never heard any sound, we thought that maybe our depth perception was off and it was actually flying higher than the 1000-2000 foot altitude than we thought. We watched it continue to fly east.  It went behind some small clouds and never came out in any direction. My partner and I are pretty skeptical and are reluctant to classify this as a \"UFO\".

Maybe about the diameter of a teaspoon when held at arm's length when directly above me, growing smaller as it grew more distant.  I compared what I was seeing to several airplanes I could see in the sky at various distances and traveling in various directions.  Looked nothing like them.

Last week my friend reported seeing the same 5 orange lights in a triangle formation that were reported over Denver last week.  He saw them twice in 5 minutes around 10:00pm.  He saw them the first time and brought a friend out who saw them the second time. last night he came inside around 10:00pm and said he seen them again and again they were headed west. No sound.  Moving to fast to be a plane and at high altitude.  I then went outside and looked up for about 15 minutes when I saw a dim white light that was going the speed of a shootin star.  I thought it was a shooting start but it never dimmed out.  I saw it go all the way across the sky until it disappeared behind the roof of a house.  No sound what so ever but had to be going super sonic speeds. Last night it was clear skies.  A little about me:  I was a skeptic about UFOs being extra terrestrial until I had a orange iridescent orb come flying at me, get about 7 feet away then turned and flew off of a cliff.  This orb was a little bigger than a golf ball and flew at about 20 miles an hour with no sound.  After that I believe that its not all government experiments. I have never seen another UFO until last night. Not sure at all what it was, just felt I needed to report it.",

Although faint the white lights were much, much larger than stars in the night sky and they did not break formation which along with the documented shape led me to believe I was looking at a flying craft.

My window faces out to the East and I have a pretty good view of the sky from where my desk is at my house.   I saw something black and shiny heading towards my house about 6-9 thousand feet up.  Lower than your usual aircraft coming in to land at DIA.  As it flew closer, I could see it tumbling over itself repeatedly and thought maybe it was a balloon at first.  But as it approached closer, I could see the sun reflecting off it very brightly and could easily tell that it wasn\u2019t a balloon.  It started to get a little larger as it came closer and I ran outside to get a better look.  I am so glad I did that because what I saw next confirmed what I was hoping for all along. As I stood on my porch, I was able to see this thing pretty well at that point.  It was very black and shiny and was shape-shifting from a star-like object, into a triangle object and then into something I cannot even describe on any level.  But it changed shapes as it continued to tumble over itself.  But every time it tumbled, you could see something different going on, almost as if it needed to tumble in order to accomplish a particular task.  I don\u2019t know\u2026that\u2019s the best way I can describe it I guess. At any rate, after watching this for 1-2 minutes, I watched it for as far as I could before it flew completely out of sight.  However, someone from downtown Denver should have been able to capture this thing well depending on his or her location.  It was heading towards the news stations so they should have been able to see this thing too. I hope someone reports it besides me.  Oh yeah, the camera on my phone wouldn\u2019t have captured it as my phone is almost 4 years old.",

When reality hit me and I remembered there's nothing aerodynamic about a wall I just stared at the thing all the time looking for a witness, but there was no traffic on an ordinarily busy street.  Finally a young Hispanic girl with braces came along but was late to work and I couldn't even get her to look at the object.  It continued flying in a southeasterly direction and about 15 minutes later out of sight.  Important to note that it flew across Interstate 70 approaching Interstate 270 at right around 2:40PM and anybody looking up should have seen it.  The most disturbing thing is I had a good cellphone with a decent camera but I didn't even think about it and i! t remained in it's holster.  As I was watching it from behind there was at least one column like looking thing attached to the rear so ultimately I would say it was like a flying box with a propulsion mechanism attached.  It also appeared to fly over Interstate 225 a few minutes later and not far from Buckley AFB.  No noise heard during the entire encounter and as close as it was, there should have been something.",

I realized this object was moving to fast to be a passenger plane.  However it was at approximately the same height as a high fling airliner, somewhere in the 25000 ft range. The object itself was white. It was triangular shaped.  The leading point was farther away from the the 2 aft points making an elongated triangle. This object was moving very fast defiantly not fast enough to be an airliner.  There was no sound.  The light was very good.  The sun was at a great angle to reflect off the object while being behind the clouds of the weather system.  There was no trail or aura. I am a enthusiast of military air craft. I know the difference in shape of most military air craft.  This was not a fighter jet.  This was not an F-117 or B2 bomber. I have  a physical every year and my eye sight is checked at that time.  It has been checked at 20-10 vision.  This is better then 20-20. I can see very well. If I had to guess I would say this object was man made.  I would say it is a lifting body possibly a space plane, a plane capable of flying from ground to orbit to back.  I would guess it is the new spy plane to replace the SR-71 blackbird.

My children were playing with a bouquet of balloons and a large (probably 15\" x 4\") cylindrical helium filled balloon broke free and rapidly began to ascend.  People see a lot of orbs and spheres and this is one that we can effectively rule as \"identified.\".  I wanted to file a report out of respect for the purity and importance of the research that you do.  I think it's very possible that you might receive some sightings because of the balloon's startling altitude which I'm guessing was at least 1,500 feet.  The balloon traveled in a pure westerly direction at 5-10mph. ((NUFORC Note:  No reports, yet, but we are grateful to the source of this report for sharing the information.  PD))",

A small (6-12 ft.) wide classic shiny disc was flying northbound across the horizon.  I followed it with my eyes for a moment and then it just disappeared into thin air, which was pretty amazing.  I scanned the sky to see if maybe I had just lost it for a moment an at the same time was fumbling form my phone to take a shot in case I found it again.  As I scanned I noticed a dark helicopter in the vicinity flying low at about the same elevation the craft was at.  The helicopter was quite a distance off from the craft but it gave me the creeps as I am a UFO enthusiast and realized the implications.

      "story": "Transparent red balloon/bubble thing with lights. Had intelligence I was driving down Colorado Blvd going back to my sisters house when out of the corner of my eye I saw something with lights hovering above the church on 38th. I did a u-turn on 40th and turned on 38th then stopped.  I recorded it on my sisters cell phone. While recording I noticed that the object was not showing up on the screen even though I was looking right at it.  I then stopped a guy that was walking and asked him if he saw it. He said \"ya you mean that square thing with the lights, it looks like a kite\"  It was NOT a kite. It was 2:30am. I then left and drove the short distance to my sisters.  I told her about it. When I told her it was still there when I left she wanted to go see if it was still there.  We drove back to that area and it was there hovering above the church.  We stopped on 38th and sat there bewildered as to what this object was.  My sister told me to drive under it. 02 Apprehensively I decided to drive down the alley just after the ! parking lot of the church.  As we maneuvered south down the alley the object hovered above but even with the car as it moved. When we reached 37th I turned left and stopped.  The object was hovering over 37th. As we were stopped a truck passed us and pulled over to see what we were looking at. They saw the object and thought it was peculiar.  They went about their business. My sister was trying to photograph the object (which we both concluded looked like a red transparent bubble with bluish white lights that seemed to be eyes.)   When the flash went off the object hovered/floated behind some trees as if it were trying to hide. I backed up down the street so we could see it.  I then decided to see if it would \"follow\" us and drove back up the street and it did indeed stay in close proximity to the car.  We parked in the church parking lot and got out. It was not threatening in anyway, just odd.  The two guys in the truck drove back by, saw us still looking and pulled into the parking lot.  The four of us could not determine what it ! was.  It did somewhat resemble a balloon so one of the guys tried to locate where a string was that would be tethering the object and was unsuccessful. Meanwhile my sister called her boyfriend and he showed up.  He too was baffled as to what this floating/hovering object could be.  The two guys in the truck left and my sister, her boyfriend and I just watched.  It seemed to be looking at us with the lights.  The lights moved as if it were thinking or computing.  I'm not sure of the correct word... It had intelligence.  By the time we left it was 4:00am and the object never went out of sight.  We left it, it didn't disappear.  During this time we also saw 2 what seemed to be stars go from standstill to across the sky.  It was like they took it out of park and moved quickly across the entire sky.",

      "story": "Daytime sighting in Denver City Limits, witnessed UFO color, communications, movements of 6 flying craft. Working tech support in a skyscraper downtown Denver, 18th floor, looking north over Denver, Commerce City.  A sun-shining Sunday afternoon, I watched a lone, low storm cloud move southward towards the city.  As I was helping a customer fix email connectivity, I focused on watching the cloud swirls and wisps.  I noticed a shiny flicker under the cloud ceiling.   As I honed in on the shine, I clearly saw 5 oval, pill shaped crafts, stationary in a 5 dot pattern formation.  The ships would then all swing up and out, down and back in to produce a new 5 dot pattern. (I likened it to braille patterns.  I got the impression they were producing communication with the different patterns.)  They continued to display different patterns.  I quickly put my customer on hold and ran to an adjacent room where 4 of my co-workers were on calls.  I hollered with authority for all of them to put their calls on hold and hurry to my window.  All 5 of us stood at the window watching these crafts move.   I then noticed, under the southern most tip of this lone storm cloud, was a 6th craft fully stationary.  As if in a supervisory roll, or to monitor any \"dot pattern\" messages being sent to them, idk.   The storm cloud was not high in the sky, it was smaller and by itself, so lots of sun shine.  All 6 air ships had dark bottoms and shiny metallic roofs.  I figured the dark bottoms helped them stay concealed under the dark looking storm cloud.  You probably wouldn't notice them being underneath, they may not have caught your eye to make you look up.  Remember, I was on the 18th floor looking across to them.   They flew over the area of Rocky Mountain Arsenal State Park, or the Oil Refinery in Commerce City.  The was no lights, no sounds, no flares or fire or smoke.  The movements were controlled and intelligent, similar to two like magnets repelling, but controlled. After the sighting, I emailed Art Bell at Coast to Coast AM and the local NBC 9 news station, although never hearing anything back.   These ships were real, in the daylight, and very close to the Denver vicinity.",

As we watched the fireworks over the city we both noticed three lights moving around about 15-20 degrees above the horizon.  Their distance from us was hard to judge but my impression was that it was a good distance away &gt;4 miles.  The lights seemed to fade in and out of sight in order from three to one then three again.   The three lights maintained what seemed an equal distance from each other at all times.  A perfect formation in a triangular shape.  If the lights were on the corners of a flat triangular shape then the flat plane of that object looked to be twisting and rolling slowly but the lights remained visible.  The size of the lights were much larger than any of the surrounding fireworks which made them stand out more and the color was the light yellow of a typical street light as I recall.",

      "story": "Silent and Fast-Moving Orange Orb Over Denver On the evening of 5/11/13 my wife and I had our good friends over to our new house for dinner and to sit out by our fire pit afterward.  It was near the end of the evening (somewhere between 10:30 PM \u201311:00 PM) when a helicopter flew over and put its spot light right on us which was weird but also had it on the neighborhood briefly.  We live in a quiet neighborhood in south-east Denver and just moved from north-east Denver where police choppers \u2013 especially on the weekends were common so while this was strange we didn\u2019t really think much of it.  What was weird and unexplainable is what happened next\u2026   About 2-3 minutes after the helicopter flew over, we all were still a little sensitive to things flying overhead and we all saw a strange orange light moving quickly towards us from the south west (it appeared to be moving as fast as a fighter jet) but made no sound at all.  As I mentioned our neighborhood is quiet and neither of us could hear anything coming from this object.    When the object appeared directly overhead we could all see a light orange circular craft of some kind with a darker orange center that sort of pulsated but there were no blinking lights like you see on an airplane or helicopter.   We watched the object travel north east and at which point I brilliantly decided to get a video of it on my phone but I was just a tad too late.   By the time I looked up and my wife and our friends stopped making fun of me for thinking of this after it was well over our location, the object disappeared.  It was probably 20 miles or more past our house by the time we lost sig! ht.  I noticed another report came in from Steamboat Springs, CO that same night that has a similar description of the object we saw.   My wife and I and our friends (also husband and wife) are all well-educated people but none of us have ever seen anything like this.  Even with that said, we all kind of blew it off but I decided to check out if there was a way to report it since I have thought about it several times in the past couple of weeks since it occurred.   I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an explanation for what we saw but figured it\u2019s worth reporting anyway.",

We yelled for a person in house to come see.   The light went off and the altitude dropped just above tree top level.  We could still see it when it went lights out.   At that point it looked like a big bubble that was changing shape.   The thrid person saw it with lights off.  The orb Changed shape like a bubble blown with soap. The size was hard to tell but it looked to be 8 or 10 feet around.   Even though it drop in altitude it kept going directly in the path of the street until it was out of sight.

My street is caddy-wampus, so the front faces north and east.  And if you look polar north, neighboring trees block the horizontal view.   Well as soon we backed into our driveway, we all took notice to a strange grouping of orbs all glowing orange traveling in the night sky.  We noticed they had a vertical trajectory, and one right after another they came up in the northern hemisphere as something that raised up into plain view, and came to stop at the same point in the sky, pulsated for a moment than vanished.  We seen 3 objects one right after another within a 5-10min span of time do this.

There were no spotlights on the ground such as those you see during grand openings, and  frankly, the orbs were too bright, incredibly bright.

Our flight had been delayed for several hours due to mechanical errors and then poor weather conditions, so we were on the runway waiting to depart along with several other airplanes that were also delayed.  Our plane was just sitting on the runway waiting for other planes to lift off.  I was looking out the window watching how many planes were just sitting there as it was a really weird to see 8-10 planes lined up like that. It was then that I noticed a small bright light becoming larger and brighter at around 3000 ft and about a \u00bc of a mile away from our plane.  I think we were looking towards the South, but I don\u2019t know that for sure.  It was too low to be a planet or star and it was most definitely not a plane or helicopter as it sat stationary.  I asked my friend sitting next to me what she thought it was and she said she thought it was a satellite.  I laughed and said that there was no way it could be a satellite as it was just sitting there and the fact that it was so low and bright, that no satellite could do that, so I kept watching.  This is where it got really weird. It first appeared as a small white-yellowish light that became larger and brighter right in front of my eyes.  Then it became about the size of a dime (a little smaller actually) at arm\u2019s length. It sat there for about 45-60 seconds, moved a little to the left, and then it disappeared. I pointed out to my friend that it just disappeared and she said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s not a satellite then!\u201d  I kept looking to see if it would come back and it did!  This time, it did the exact same thing as before, starting out as small, got bigger and brighter, stayed put for a bit, and then moved to the left, and then it disappeared again.  But this time, my friend saw it come back and watched it do exactly what I described the first time.  We were blown away as it seemed to be observing all the aircrafts lined up waiting to take off. As we were complaining about just sitting on the runway with no movement, it came back a 3rd time and made itself known in the exact same fashion as the previous events.  This time I took a picture of it with my new phone.  I haven\u2019t figured out a way to make the picture bigger or clearer yet, but I\u2019m excited to see what it\u2019ll look like once I do. Also, the following night in Cape Cod, I and 2 other friends had another sighting that just blew our minds!  I\u2019ll make another report for that sighting under the state of Massachusetts in a little while.",

Initially, one child alerted all of us to something strange moving through the sky.  It was definitely quite visible, but hardly discernable!!  Shortly, I called the Denver Police Dept. and inquired if anyone had informed them of something in the sky, to which they said no.   While speaking with the DPD dispatch, and having had my phone speaker on from the beginning, she could hear myself and all other witnesses excitedly speaking about first one more, then another, only this one was sort of beneath the one on the top, but they were in sync with each other.   DPD transferred me to the FAA, who also reported no reports of activities in the sky inconsistent with normalcy.\t\t For the next 10 to 12 minutes all six of us witnessed in awe at a beautiful event, ultimately involving not less than six vehicles.   They were all the same in physical appearances.  They moved horizontal and rather slow, by other accounts of vehicles.  They were steady.  They were red but not fiery red.  All of them were like this.  They were definitely well into the sky.  When, from our view point, they all reached what seemed to be the same juncture, this huge white light appeared in the front of each craft.  Then it went out and more white lights appeared, only seemingly from within the red tail.   We noticed that a plane was near-by, prompting one child to remark that it was going to collide with this \u201cthing!\u201d  And it sure did look like this was likely from down on the ground, but nothing happened.  Shortly thereafter, another earthly vehicle went by, both vehicles heading northward, opposite the direction of the UFO\u2019S. \tSince we\u2019re all were able to see the earthly vehicles, it made since to me that the UFO\u2019s had to have been relatively close, and the passing of the earthly vehicles provided me with the only reliable means of discerning how far away and how far up they were (as there was no horizon, no sky line \u2026 just sky!",

      "story": "squadron of enormous UFOs seen over denver at moment of full lunar eclipse i was looking at the just eclipsed moon through binoculars when a squadron of UFOs entered my field of view.  they were silently flying in a flat V formation with 3 on the short line and 8 on the long.  their leading edge was glowing red.  i believe the glow was from the friction of traveling fast through the upper atmosphere.  they passed over head and to my right traveling north.  when they first appeared the length of the line was about 3 times the width of the moon as it appeared in the sky.  each ship was about one ship width behind the other. on this form i checked a box under \"animals responded to the event\". i did notice just before i spotted this squadron that dogs began to bark all over the neighborhood.  at the time, i did wonder if it was in response to the eclipse or just a coincidence. i really don't think it was in response to these UFOs that were flying in the upper atmosphere.  but...  who knows?

      "story": "A boomerang-shaped black object flys overhead during an eclipse in Denver My friend and I were watching an eclipse a little while ago when we saw this really big boomerang shaped thing start to fly over us.  You really had to look hard to see it.   At first I thought it was a huge bird but it got closer and you could tell it wasn't an animal.  It was black and blended into sky, and had white lights or dots on it but they weren't very bright.  It silently and slowly went right over the house.  It seemed like it was very close.   We paused for a moment because we thought maybe someone was flying a kite.  I went around the house to see where it went but I couldn't see it.  It didn't seem like anyone was flying a kite nearby.  It was a clear night.   My friend and I are 22, and we've known each other all our lives.  I am very skeptical, I don't know if it is likely that this was some sort of alien thing but I think its fun to entertain the idea.   My friend is more skeptical than I am and she and I were both a little weirded out by the experience.  I feel a little shaken up by it, and I wanted to tell the story because I just wanted it to be on record somewhere.   Denver is just not a place I ever expected to see a UFO, especially in a residential area.  I also know that I can't ever tell the story again because no one will believe it.

      "story": "Two Star-like UFO's Seen in Denver During the Time of  the  2012 Summer Olympics in August. I was up late and watering the grass at the small apartment complex I live in.  I was facing east and across the street there is a parking lot.  In the northwest corner area of this lot there is a tall evergreen-like tree.  I just happened to look up at the sky in that direction as I often look at the sky when watering the grass at night. Positioned above the tip top of the evergreen tree I saw what looked like a large bright star.  It looked like just a typical star, white in color, but noticeably larger, like six stars together.  It was not physically over the tree, but its position in the sky was above the tip of the tree.  I must admit I go a little alarmed because I had heard about alien abductions.  I decided to communicate with it.  But I did this inaudibly.  I sent a thought/question to it and asked if it was from the Christ (meaning Jesus).  And, if so would it blink off and back on again. The star dimmed down, like it had a dimmer switch, until it was not visible and lit up again. I then asked if it was here for the rapture.  The star dimmed down again, but this time it dimmed down and lit up twice; and, the second lighting it appeared brighter than before. I need to add that sometime during this occurence, a young man was walking across the street going southbound and I asked him if he could see that huge star.  He said something inaudible and smiled/laughed and kept walking. As I kept watching the star, it started to slowly ascend upward.  As it was doing this, off to the right, another star (this one was like an ordinary star in size) started ascending upward and to the left, like at a 45 degree angle as if going toward the larger star. Both objects went upward and out of sight.  The ascension was not swift, but slow.",

Approximately, at 6:15 in the afternoon of October 14, 2014 my son and I witnessed the following events in downtown Denver, Colorado. I was visiting him from Atlanta and enjoying a clear blue sky in his 3rd floor loft condominium that is surrounding by windows.   I suddenly noticed a bright silver streak in the sky as if the bright son was reflecting off of an airplane.  I kept waiting for the image to change and then the streak just disappeared.  I didn\u2019t at the point think much of it, but a few seconds after I saw what appeared to be a fire trail from nowhere burning into the clear sky. At that point, I told my son, and we quickly went to his deck to get a better view.   Just as we arrived on the deck about 3 orbs appeared.  They were far away and looked about the size of large star.  It was daylight and you could see them clearly.  Perfectly round and moving slightly; some moving faster than others. The one that was the steadiest and affixed in one place for a while as if staring at us, suddenly burst into a flame it appeared.  Making a definite light streak as you will see on the video.  On the camera it appears as white, but in reality, pink to coral was the color of the streak and quite beautiful.  In a matter of seconds, the streak was gone, but the orb remained just as it was before.  It had, to the naked eye, to not have moved at all.  As we were witnessing and trying to video this astonishing sight with a camera during the next 20 minutes, we noticed a total of 5 orbs in all.  These 5 orbs started moving toward the same location.  Some of them streaked as the moved, and they were moving due west of Downtown Denver to the right of Mount Evans.  As they approached the outlying hills, they dropped from the sky and fell behind a smaller peak.  One by one they disappeared slowly, deliberately to the same point.  I immediately called the local news channels to ask what they were.  I was hung up on by two of the major channels and finally the local ABC affiliate asked for a video.  We had to condense the video to the point I am sure it was hard to see, but as we watched the news there was no mention of these events at all.  I have called the FAA in Washington and they were helpful and told me to report these events to the local office here. Which I have done.  It does not have to be explained as aliens invading the earth, but it would be nice if the powers that be would at least tell the public they are not crazy when they see an actual event.  Thank you.",

Going from my 1 o'clock position east to west.  I snapped out of it after seeing it for about 5 seconds & ran inside to get to get my husband.  We ran out to the front yard.  It had disappeared. We went to the backyard and after 5 minutes we both saw it again.  It appeared at the eve of the roof going north to south this time.  But it had undulating wings made of the same yellow colored lights.  6 of them so 3 on either side.  They were gently moving like a snake out from the center.  But the lights moved independently from either side kinda like a crawling octopus tentacle.  It lasted about 10 seconds that time. It reappeared again about 15 minutes later 12 o'clock high moving northeast to southwest.  My husband saw it first.  It was very high this time.  It was like the first one l saw again.  It lasted about 4 seconds that time. I saw another one about 10 minutes later.  It was completely different.  It looked like a wispy rod shaped gray cloud.  Either that or it occurred to me laster while writing this, that it could have been a gray long barrel shaped craft with no lights pushing thru the clouds.  It moved from 12'oclock  high to the direct south.  It was very fast again.  It lasted 3-4 seconds.  My husband didnt see that one. Then l saw the same type of wispy cloudlike thing but it was triangle shaped.  No lights.  Very strange floating motion.  It was just gliding like on ice.  It lasted about 3 seconds.  I was facing west.  It appeared   above me going west. The fifth one was 15 minutes later.  My husband had gone inside.  It was another wispy rodlike cloud going from 12:00 high to the west.

On Saturday, August 2, 2014 at approximately 2245 mountain time, I was standing on the sidewalk in Northwest Denver, in the vicinity of 38th Avenue and Yates Street when I saw two bright orange objects traveling northeasterly in the dark night sky.  They were well above tree line and houses, and were coming from the southwest traveling in a perfectly straight line at a stable elevation, coming from the Sheridan Avenue area in the Edgewater vicinity. Two of us saw them.  They were traveling quietly and perfectly synchronized together. After between 30 and 60 seconds both bright orange glowing orbs kind of flashed brighter one time, then immediately disappeared, both at exactly the same time.  They did not appear to drop in elevation at all, they just disappeared.  They disappeared when they were probably over Yates and 41st Avenue area or a little farther northeast. I would guess the two orbs, or what ever they were, were traveling about as high as a helicopter flies around Denver, maybe a little lower.  Very bright orange, almost red glowing, appearing to be round / oval in shape.  Pretty good size; smaller than the body of a helicopter but maybe about six or seven feet in diameter, about the size of a hot tub.  It was hard to really ascertain the size or the distance they were from us in the dark night sky and with the bright orange glow they emitted. The Denver skies were partly cloudy, but the area these were in was in a completely clear sky. They were moving at a good clip, completely quiet though and perfectly synchronized together. They were probably visible by us for a total of 30 to 60 seconds.  Two of them, perfectly spaced apart and traveling side by side, but not connected to each other. We have both seen Chinese type lanterns in the night sky, but these were NOT lanterns. These were two bright orange objects, separated by space but traveling perfectly together. They appeared together and disappeared at exactly the same time.",

As I was staring out my window, there was a strange orange light coming towards me.  It looked somewhat neon, but softer.  The light was vibrating rapidly at frequencies I've never seen in any man-made aircraft.   As it approached, I could see 3 different colored rockets attached on the bottom and a gray/white roof on top.  The top was sort of triangular and the bottom had 3 rockets that were cone-shaped with flames of light coming off of them.  One of the rockets flames was orange/yellowish, one was blue, and one was red. It seemed like it was vibrating instead of being propelled by an engine.   It flew about 20 feet above my window and very close to the roof of my 10-story building.  It happened very fast.  The vibration of the aircraft was so fast that taking a picture would most likely have resulted in an image of an extremely blurry light.  Although it was vibrating so fast, it seemed like it had slowed down to observe the area for some reason.   This was in Capitol Hill.",

      "story": "Intelligent burning fireball over University Hills/ Denver, CO My boyfriend and I were leaving to go to dinner when we both saw something strange in the sky just above my neighborhood in university hills.  It looked like something burning and on fire, which alarmed us at first.  We could tell it wasn't a plane or anything with a constant beam of light because there was a center light that was bright and the flickering fire-like light was moving up from the lower ball of light, just as flames move up and \"lick\" the air.   The object wasn't flying as high up as commercial airplanes fly, but more around the height a helicopter would hover.  It was on a constant path moving from west to east at a constant speed when it stopped suddenly for about a minute; it just hovered there and kept burning.  Then it started moving again at a slower speed moving south, also appearing to gain height in altitude as well.  We could see the light grow faint but could no longer see the burning.  At this point we were viewing the object thro! ugh the trees and watched it change course again heading slightly diagonal towards south east.   Just as fast as it had appeared out of nowhere, it began moving up in altitude very quickly until it was just a faint light, almost as if it was a star, despite the snow that was falling and the fact that no stars were visible.   I took a video that captures the main chunk of the sighting but my phone died just after it began gaining altitude and disappeared.   The fact the object was burning was alarming enough, but the intelligent speed and direction changes were enough to convince us this was something foreign and extraterrestrial.",

Easily big enough to resolve with binoculars or other sighting device, but unfortunately, I didnt have one ready..     3 Objects came into view from the south and continued due North.   We were able to watch their entire track from almost horizon to horizon.  All 3 orange globes were following the same track, about 15 seconds behind each other, and completed the horizon to horizon track in less than 1 minute.   The objects were BELOW the cloud base (eliminates meteors), moving VERY fast, and made absolutely ZERO sound.  Fireworks would be an impossibility because of the duration, speed, and precision track of the objects. I am prior Air Force, so I have extensive experience in what night flight aircraft look and sound like, expecially on clear quiet nights..  My first instinct was that these were aircraft in full military power afterburners.  But again, there was NO sound, and afterburners are VERY loud, especially at that relatively low altitude.. There was one other witness to this event..      First time in my life I can't explain away something I've seen.",

I was lying on the sidewalk in front of my house admiring the sunset, which is something I often do.  I noticed a black, medicine-capsule shaped object flying overhead from East to West.   At first, I thought that it was just a balloon, but as I watched it, I changed my mind.  I have seen many balloons flying, as most people have.  All that I have seen go primarily upwards, and also usually move somewhat horizontally.  They usually tend to wiggle a bit and wobble as they fly.   This object did not appear to rise upwards at all.  It seemed to maintain a completely horizontal movement, and apparently moved in a straight line toward the west.  It did not wiggle or wobble at all as a small balloon would.  It made no noise at all.   I was able to watch it for a minute or two, until it traveled so far into the distance that I couldn't see it anymore.  I wasn\u2019t really sure about the size of it, but I recently saw a helicopter in the sky at about the same location in the sky, and about the same time in the evening.  The helicopter appeared to be about the same size as the object I saw, as well as about the same altitude, and seemed to move at about the same speed.   The thing that I saw was certainly not a helicopter, as it clearly capsule-shaped, as I mentioned, and made not noise at all.   I saw something similar about two weeks earlier, that was moving the opposite direction, from West to East, at about the same time of evening.

About a minute or so it did reappear, some distance away.  I was looking to the west, and it was shortly after the sky had become completely dark.  The light was traveling from south to north.  It disappeared slightly to the southwest, and reappeared slightly to the northwest.  At that time, I believe that it blinked off and on once or twice, and then there was what appeared to be an electrical discharge, vertically.  It was like a very short bolt of lightning, except whiter, and perfectly straight, which I estimate took up about one to two degrees of distance in the sky (or, about the thickness of my finger at arm's length).

Balcony viewpoint was 10th Avenue in Denver, for perspective, cross street Broadway.   This craft appeared to be totally cylindrical, and would go from 100% illumination extremely bright white light, to absolutely 0% and totally dark, back to fully lit, back to fully dark, repeat until out of site.  Full video available. After this craft appeared to have gone out of site, within approximately two minutes, a SECOND craft appeared (first craft gone, may have been same craft but different scenario). Second craft was full bright white/orange light, also totally cylindrical, appeared to hover in place for a solid two minutes, brilliantly lit, and then appeared to gain altitude.  Zero presence of flashing lights as would be indicated on traditional commercial craft.  This literally floated/hovered mid air with no observable movement.  Southbound from balcony at 10th and Broadway, no flashing, not sure if different craft or if same craft as above but using different lighting scheme and hovering as opposed to forward/southbound momentum. Have video footage of both.  Not exactly eager to post online given scrutiny factor.",

      "story": "Two white cigar shaped UFO's stop and hover over I-25 in Denver, then change to an amber color and disappear. My wife and I were driving northbound on I-25 from Colorado Springs to Denver.  The sighting happened somewhere between CO 470 and Yale Avenue.  We had seen several commercial aircraft flying at low altitudes over the interstate coming from DIA before the sighting.  We then saw two flat, white discs or cigar shaped objects.  We were looking at them edge on, they were definitely not saucer or dome shaped.  The objects were moving at approximately the same altitude and speed relative to the other commercial airliners. The two objects caught our attention because they seemed to move similar to the aircraft previously seen, but didn't have wings and appeared at least twice the size of the commercial airliners.  In comparison with the Sun, they would have fit almost perfectly into the radius of the Sun's circle, with perhaps some overlap for the object closest to us (further south).  They looked like thin, bring white lines across the deep blue sky.  Today was a beautiful sunny day, so their bright white color against the deep blue back drop was very easily seen. I estimated they were a good 5 to 10 miles ahead of us, looking due North.  Of course, I'm not a good judge of aerial distances, but I use the other commercial aircraft in the area as my point of reference for this estimation.  One of the objects was obviously closer to us (further south) while the second appeared smaller and seemed to be few miles further North than the first object closest to us.   They appeared to move from an E to a NW direction, similar to the commercial aircraft coming out of DIA over downtown Denver headed west over the mountains.  Then, they suddenly stopped over I-25 or perhaps just west of I-25.   At this point we were looking at them NNW of our viewpoint on I-25N.  The two objects then hovered for about 30 seconds max (possibly less) and then began to turn a reddish orange color, slowly becoming more and more transparent with the blue sky - and then poof!  They disappeared!   This all happened in less than a minute and we were traveling at 80 mph.  So unfortunately, we didn't get a photo or video of the event.  However, it did shake up my wife and was very unsettling to her.  She has not been one to believe in UFO's and when I tried to talk to her about it afterward, she was very uncomfortable and didn't want to discuss it.  I know what I saw and this was something very \"unidentifiable.\"   If anyone else on I-25 at this same time headed northbound along side us looked up in the sky to the North-Northwest, they would have seen the same thing.  I would imagine anyone in those commercial aircraft headed west out of DIA would have also seen this.",

I look out the passenger window to the East and notice a large, bright circular object with a bright corona in the sky over Downtown Denver.  There are no colored lights on the object to signify a conventional aircraft.  When observed through a phone seems to be either changing shapes or is emitting orbs that seemingly change the object's shape.   We take a left turn at an intersection to head West and during this time that we are turning the bright object vanishes from the sky. Approx 30 minutes later we had returned home from errands and, as we approached the door to the house, I notice the same bright, circular UFO hanging in the sky to the East.  A seemingly conventional aircraft (read: helicopter) in the same area of the sky seems to be approaching the circular object, at which point the object promptly vanishes from the night sky. I run inside to tell my friend who had already gone inside to put away items. We both return outside and observe either the same or another circular bright object to West, low on the horizon, seemingly barely above the mountains themselves.  We observe the object to the West for approx 3-5 minutes before returning inside.   5-10 minutes later I returned outside to no anomalies visible in the sky.",

I was in about the middle of the stairs, I turned up and was facing south, suddenly I saw what to me was a huge cylinder of light with white like clouds whirling around in it as it came across the sky  it was light in it like day and inside swirilling fast.  I say the cylinder was about a 50 degree angle when it came from the West, I never saw the tail end. what puzzles me the most was that the light came across like an unfolding light, it had an end to the light in the front, I never saw the end of a flashlights that was pointed in the sky, it shot across so fast, maybe I saw it for about 4 to 5 seconds, it had stopped and it was just there, then in the blink of an eye the lights just closed and dissapered, dark sky and nothing more.  it was gone and dark again. I estimated that the cylinder (I call it a cylinder because it was round ) to be maybe a mile away, but in my mind it was closer than that, not really sure. I would say for comparison the cylinder was about as wide and as round as a Train engine or a box car from a train., but it was round. from the ground level I was at.",

I always tend to look at the sky, and today I was lucky enough to witness about 50 sphere shaped objects flying in formation in the Denver sky.   At first I thought it was just a flock birds, but then this plane passed right by the objects and that's when I knew they couldn't be birds.  Reasons being, as soon as the plane passed by these objects got so close to each other creating like a wall and quickly moved out the way of the plane.   During this time the objects also change from their white color to a black color as if they felt in danger by the plane.   After the plane was out the frame these object continued to fly in abnormal directions in the sky.  I filmed them for about a minute and half before they finally just fanished into thin air.   The crazy thing is I saw two objects similar to these object about 4 days ago and also filmed it.  I dont know what they are but when I zoomed in to the objects they definitely weren't anything I have ever seen.  They were round with like two long black I guess poles at the top and bottom of the objects.   After everything happened.  I went back inside my building and for some reason I felt really angry and agitated.  I felt this way for about 5 minutes.   I hope I can spot some more UFOs in the future.",

She woke me up at 2:30 on the morning of October 31 and we went outside to my backyard.  I live in the approach zones for DIA so I see many aircraft flying overhead with their landing lights on for their approach to the airport.  There are 3 safety approach zones for the airport for all but police and emergency aircraft, usually helicopters.  One goes west to east, another goes south to north and the last fro southwest to the northeast. As I was sitting watching my dog I notice an unusual aircraft flying out of the normal safety zones.  I was flying way north of the west to east zone and perpendicular to the south to north zone; crossing the southwest to northeast zone.  Next its \"landing lights\" were pink, not white or yellow.  It also did not have any navigation lights flashing.  The craft was moving rather slowly then came to a complete stop for about a minute or longer.  Then it started moving again.  It disappeared into the clouds.  The entire time there was not a sound of any kind made not even my dog.",

On 04/03/2018, at approximately 06:00, I observed a fast-moving object at apparently very high altitude, moving from North to South.  It crossed between the two stars in Ursa Major that point towards Polaris and Polaris itself, somewhat closer to Polaris.  Object appeared to be at significantly greater altitude than commercial airliners, though possibly attainable by military aircraft.  It reminded me somewhat of early satellites which did not follow the earth's rotation in terms of brightness, but speed was greater.  The object was too distant to determine size or shape.  The sky was cloudless and dark. What caught my attention was that it appeared to consistently move at what I surmised to be several times the speed of sound, yet several times instantly \u201cjump ahead\u201d some distance.  Distance \u201cjumped\u201d was hard to estimate due to altitude, but I would say in the tens of miles each time.

I was sitting on the left side of the plane in the window seat, and the storm was directly in front of my window.  I pulled out my phone to take a video of the lightning because I thought it looked pretty cool from how high up we were.  While I was filming, I noticed a flashing red and white light flying.  It was flying the opposite direction of the plane I was in.  The object was flying in a straight line, and then it started to lower, stopped blinking for a second, and then when it started blinking again, it was up high again as if it had reversed.  It then kept flying away.  It looked almost like a drone, but because of how high up we were, there\u2019s no way it was a drone or a building light, etc.  I also thought it could\u2019ve been! a plane, but because of how quickly it moved, I didn\u2019t think it could be that either.  I think I would of been able to see the outline of the plane if that had been what it was also.  It was very small and I didn\u2019t see it\u2019s shape because of how dark it was.
