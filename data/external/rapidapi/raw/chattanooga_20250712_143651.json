While driving down the highway last night,  a single bright orange fireball arose vertically over the tree line in the horizon.  It glowed brighter and  brighter and seemed to increase in size. Once it reached the middle of the sky it began swiftly moving to the right and vanished. It was me, my brother, and my sister.  We could not believe our eyes. We could not figure out what it was. As soon as it appeared, it vanished.  It left an eerie silence in its wake. Later that night, after I went to bed, I vaguely recall waking up and seeing  crazy lights flashing in my window and a hearing a strange rumbling noise.  I tried to fully wake up but I couldn\u2019t, it was like I was stuck in a haze.  I finally snapped out of the \u201chaze\u201d  when my dog jumped on my bed and started wining.  I assumed there was a thunderstorm (I thought what I had experienced was lightening and thunder and my dog only whines during storms) but when I checked  the weather it was crystal clear.",

I went out to investigate and up in the sky was a light, which at first I dismissed as a star. I was about to walk back inside when I saw this craft move at incredible speed closer to us. It was then that I noticed that what I was looking at was NO STAR! It was cigar shaped with a long triangular strut coming off the top and two smaller ones coming out the bottom, kind of like landing gear. I noticed yellow and green lights rotating around the craft with a large yellow light on top of the large triangular strut. It hovered COMPLETELY noiseless for about 10 minutes, then me and my family witnessed 3 or 4 smaller crafts come out of the bottom and fly away. The speeds of these crafts were humanly impossible! The smaller crafts were pulsating green lights. After about another 8 minutes we all witnessed the smaller crafts re-enter the large one. It continued to hover for a couple of minutes then it just disappeared right before our eyes! I just want to let everyone know that this is NO HOAX! I am very good at debunking things but I can never debunk what my family and I saw that night. I have also heard numerous reports on the internet about a lot of other people seeing these objects not only in Tennessee but in other states as well. I hope more people come forward about these sightings.",

Approximately 8:50 pm as I stepped out onto our second floor deck a bright white star like flash of light high in the night sky caught my eye, it originated from a point about 80 degrees up and directly in the SSW.  I continued to watch the area thinking it was just a plane or possibly the final glint from an Iridium flare, after four or five seconds another flash occurred in exactly the same spot. No other lights were visible near that point of light. After another four to five seconds another flash appeared in exactly the same place, it was clear now that this was coming from a stationary source. I observed three more flashes approximately the same time apart as the previous ones; the last two however were about half the intensity as the first four. After several minutes and no activity I decided that it was over and I went inside to get the phone. I went back out with the phone and called my father to tell him about what I had just seen all the while keeping my eye on that area of the sky. Five minutes into the conversation I observed a commercial jet heading from South to North, nothing unusual. At about the same time as I noticed the jet coming from the South a fuzzy, red pulsating light appeared in the SSW slightly lower in the sky than the first event I described above. After a few seconds it was apparent that this red light was moving in my general direction and that it would pass directly overhead and that it would also intersect the path of the northbound jet, although at a much higher altitude. Careful scrutiny of the silent, rapidly approaching red light revealed absolutely no other lights on this craft. The light itself appeared somewhat fuzzy, with the apparent size of a pea held at arms length, it had a central hotspot that seemed very slightly less red than the overall area of red light. It appeared to pulsate between bright and dim about once a second, never actually going black between pulses. The night was practically silent, no traffic no, ambient noise. The only sounds were the barely discernable engine noise from the faraway jet and the occasional rustling of leaves. As I said the red light was headed in my general direction, moving from the SSW to the NNE and from my perspective it appeared that it was going to pass through the very same spot in the sky as the light flashes noted above. At the point when it did reach that spot, and coincidently high above the northbound jet this red light suddenly changed direction. It\u2019s hard to describe, but essentially, one second it\u2019s on a path that will bring it directly overhead and the next it\u2019s moving parallel to the northbound jet, although higher and to the right of the plane. I was able to observe the jet and this object for the next 10 or 15 seconds as they headed North and eventually out of my view.",

      "story": "Silent blue light and motionless white light seen in sky over Chattanooga Two neighbors and I were sitting on the porch enjoying the cool night breeze. We were all talking when I noticed a bright white light in the sky straight ahead of my line of sight (in the direction of the Tennessee River). At first I dismissed it as a helicopter. In that general direction is Erlanger Medical and the Life Force helicopter is not an unusual occurrence. I watched this for a few minutes without comment. Then a second, much brighter round blue light approached slowly from further away to come close to the stationary white light. I said \u201cwhat is that?\u201d My neighbors stopped talking and turned around to look up at the two lights. We were all on our feet at this point, talking about how strange the blue light was. It moved like a slow helicopter with an atypical light, yet it was totally silent. The helicopters that fly around this area are never silent. Also, there wasn\u2019t any traffic that night. It was quiet out and we couldn\u2019t hear engine sounds. The white light winked out after six or seven minutes and the blue light flew away in the direction of North Chattanooga until it was gone. Roughly a minute later it flew back in our direction, performing a few maneuvers. I made an offhand comment that if anything \u2018came out\u2019 of the light we should all hightail it indoors and lay low. The blue light headed off again across the river until it was out of sight. I\u2019m not sure what to make of this sighting. We have helicopters, a major airport in Brainerd, and the Riverbend Festival was still going on at Ross\u2019s Landing. Nothing matches what we saw. The light was too back and forth to be a plane and too quiet to be a helicopter. And nothing at Riverbend is an airborne attraction. What is most profound to me, and my neighbors as well, was the eerie quality of that blue light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

Her older brother was to be meeting us at Outback with his girlfriend to celebrate my friend having been released for one of what we though to be her final two week breaks before she was to be cleared for being in remission for the cancer she had been suffering with for the last year. We all gathered and had a wonderful time at dinner, and when we decided to leave we had to sit much longer than expected because the battery in my friends parents\u2019 van had died. Her brother helped jump start the battery and her dad was to take the brother and his girlfriend home for some reason I can\u2019t remember. Well, this left myself, my friend, and her deaf mother to go together back to our home in a different city (about thirty minutes away), since my friend was to be spending the night with me that night. Finally we got on the road and about ten to twelve minutes after we got on the freeway Amy and I saw an odd light out of the corner of our eyes and both looked up to see what it was. We both saw what looked to be an oval-shaped ring of various colors (pink, green, blue, orange, yellow, purple, and white) that was titled at an angle and seemed to be spinning counter-clockwise. It was dormant in the sky, staying in one place and not moving. Suddenly it began, very slowly, to move in a \u2018cross\u2019 pattern (up, down, up, left, right, down). We weren\u2019t the only one who noticed because we saw people sticking pointed fingers from their cars and honking their horns. Finally, it seemed to just lower behind the mountains we were headed towards and disappeared.

I looked up at a large cumulus type cloud and noticed what looked like a tiny silver sphere hovering next to the upper right part of the cloud.  It was very shiny, reflecting the sun like a car would on a sunny day.   I immediately stopped running and stared at this object trying to figure out what I was looking at.  I could tell the cloud was moving slowly towards me, but the object seemed to remain stationary.   After a few moments the object moved to the left, appearing to go inside of the cloud.  It stayed hidden for a few seconds, then moved right and again hovered in the same spot.   I watched it for a few moments, and it seemed to begin to move vertically very slowly.  Then it again moved left into the cloud and didn't emerge for what felt like several minutes.

Often times I have seen Jetliners moving at a recognizable pattern involving a straight line flight or satellite movement which are very high above normal commercial aircraft flight patterns.  This was during spring break so my two children were at home and outside with me at the time,in fact, my oldest was the first to spot the bright approaching lights and coined the term \"Space wars\" after the event. The leading craft was moving much faster than a normal high flying jetliner and was moving in a 30 degree zig-zag as if it was \"swimming\" (best way I can describe it) and it suddenly passed another very bright and stationary object.  Then, For the lack of a better description, it \"dematerialized\" and faded away after it passed the stationary object.  Once passed and it was no longer visible,immediately in a split second, it seemed as if another craft equally as bright with a streak trailing, shot/zipped past where first craft had been headed ,  As if it was attempting to intercept the first crafts position in one of it's zig-zag motions. It honestly looked like something was attempting to shoot it down and was making a \"leading shot\" just as if you would if you were shooting a fast moving object.However,instead of hitting the first object by anticipating it's location,  The first object had disappeared leaving whatever it was that was attempting to intercept it shooting off into the distance with a big bright streak behind it. Then the stationary craft illuminated very,very brightly and shot off into the distance. I have never seen anything like it in all my life. My daughter kept saying, \"They are shooting at each other\" over and over again until it woke my wife who was sleeping upstairs on the other side of the house she was so loud. My son, Who is 6 was there to he ran inside to grab is toy gun and a set of cheap tasco binoculars. 20 minutes later there were several fast moving aircraft all over the place at about half the altitude of these objects. They did a number of grid like patterns then they were gone.

I was sitting in the front passenger seat while watching the sky, we were traveling about 75 miles an hour when I noticed them.  They appeared to be just outside of Chattanooga to the South of the city.  Due to being on a road trip, the driver and I had no time to stop and watch them, longer than they were plainly visible from the vehicle.  We did see fireworks going off about ten minutes prior to the event, however, given our speed and ground covered, the orbs were not in the same vicinity as the fireworks. I called a friend to file this report.  (The report was dictated in real time via phone call)",

      "story": "Four family members witnessed some 14-18 bright yellow/orange lights move slowly over city We live on the brow of a mountain that looks out over the city of Chattanooga, TN.  At about 9:30 pm my daughter, who is only 8 yrs old, was looking out our bay window and asked me to come look at this yellow/orange light in the sky.  I said, oh it's probably just a helicopter but as I pulled back the drapes to reveal the enitre line of sight from the window, I was astonished to see that the sky was full of them. The lights were clearly moving and all of them seemed to be moving in the same direction, across the mountain from the SouthWest heading NorthEast.  The mountain we live on is some 2300 in elevation and the lights were not too far higher than that, but clearly above the mountain, as they passed over the mountain. My father and his wife live next door and we called them to come out on the porch and look. They both witnessed the event as well.  My father (68) and myself (40) have lived on the mountain for most of our entire lives, on the brow of the mountain since 1980 and neither of us have ever experienced anything like what we saw. I have looked every night since and have not seen anything at all in the night skies other than distant planes and helicopters that rarely, if ever, come across the mountain.  Most all commercial flights into the city approach from the South (atlanta) and are visible way off on the horizon flying direclty north into the airport. I would be very interested in recieveing some feedback about what we experienced.  I will go on and say that since this night, we have been watching a lot of internet and TV shows about UFO sightings and we found out experience very similar to the \"Lights Over Phoenix\" experience.

      "story": "Four glowing orange orbs float over the city I had gone to bed early that night, 9:00 P.M.,  I was tired from work.  I had not yet fallen asleep when my two dogs started to growl and bark.  As I listened, one dog started to bark very loudly and was pacing rapidly all through the house.  My other dog, who NEVER barks or growls, began growling as if it were in extreme defesive mode.  I was still in bed and soon realized they were reacting to a dog outside and a few blocks away.  This other dog (outside) was freaking out so bad it sounded like it was being killed.  (This was included only because it got my attention. I am not saying the lights caused the dogs to bark, although it was very abnormal)  This got my attention and I turned over to look out my 4 ft. x 4 ft. window by my bed.  Up in the sky I saw an orange light. I was not wearing my glasses and the image was blurred, but I could immediatly see that it was unusual.  I stared, squintng, trying to adjust my focus thinking what the hell is it.  I ju! mped out of bed, grabbed my glasses, got back in bed, and watched. It hadn't moved.  I couldn't wrap my mind around it at first, I have been interested in UFOs my whole life, but to see one is mind bending!   First I deduced that it was not a reflection of light on my window as no lights were on in my house. Second, not a helicopter or plane or star or planet, this looked like it was a huge star that had come to Earth.  I was amazed, I leaned down to get a bigger view of the sky, as my roof eave was obstructing.  There was another!  I literally said \"Oh shit!\" I jumped up grabbed my phone and ran outside in my boxer shorts.  I live on a mountainside, three quarters of the way up to the top, with good views of thecity below.  Once outside I could see the huge clear open sky with FOUR round lights in a straight line! Just above the city to the left. I looked around and nobody was outside watching, I felt they should be so I let out a \"WHOOOO!!\" but no one heard.  The lights wer! e equally spaced, their height looked like they were level wit! h the to p of the mountain.  Which is not that high as the mountain is barely classified as a mountain.  The line of lights appeared as if it was around a mile long from the first light to the last but there really is no way to tell I guess. But they DID appear to be inside the semi-circular mountain range surrounding the city below. So to me they seemed close. I was unbelievably excited!  I stared at the lights trying to understand.  They were all the same.  I am assuming they were spheres,  because if they were discs or two dimensional circles they would have had to be facing me dead on because they appeared as a round circle of light.  The light did not glare as normal lights do. It seemed to be a ball of light that was contained within itself with a dull look almost like it was pulling in light instead of giving it off. there was no sound. There was movent within the orbs, I could not tell whether there were rotating lights inside or if there was a swirling effect and  changing co! lor from red to orange rapidly.  Basically it looked like four giant fireballs floating still in an evenly spaced long line.  I pointed my camera phone at one of the lights, all four would not fit in the frame, and took a picture. The result looked like a black sky.  I was frantic trying to fumble with my phone, I did not want to take my eyes off the lights.  I took another picture, my media storage had been reached and it did not let me save the second picture!! I couldn't believe it and did not want to waste time with deleting pictures.  By this time one of the lights, I do not remember which, started to  move slowly.  Maintaining the same distance, it moved into a triangular position with two other orbs forming an equal lateral triangle. T  he forth orb started to move slowly into position between two orbs and outside the triangle.  Seconds later all orbs moved simultaneously very slow from west to east right over the city. Anyone that looked up at that time would have seen them.  They passed over the city and &#8206;Saturday, &#8206;February &#8206;11, &#8206;2012phone. I realised I got a picture, it looks like a u-shaped light that is different colors. I put it on my computer and it's a little clearer, but my camera phone isn't great.  Although you can tell it is not a plane.  A few minutes later I actually called the police which I normally would not do.  I wanted to see if they had recieved any other calls about it.  He did not seem to care, although he did ask me a question or two.  I called my brother right after as the lights were headed towards his house, but he didn't see anything.  A couple of days later, I was on YOUTUBE and found a video: \"UFO OVER CHATTANOOGA 12/28/11\" the same date as my sighting.! The video shows exactly what I saw except ther are three lights.  This made me feel good to know that some one else saw them.  His location was the opposite of my view.  There is also a video of ufo over chattanooga that is a hoax, japanese candle balloons.  They don't even come close to what  I saw.  I have always read about UFO witnesses saying that it was liked nothing they had ever seen. Now I know what they mean. I am a capenter.",

As we approached closer it wad noted to triangular in shape.  There were three lights on each point of the triangle that were white in color.  The center of the craft had a red light that flashed occasionally but without purpose.  I could see the surface of the craft as well and it appeared dark and possibly reflective.  The craft as it descended crossed the road and I made a uturn in my car to try to get a picture.  It was then noted to be hovering at treetop level (for about 10 seconds ) and was silent.  I estimate the craft to be around the size of 3 sedan sized cars.   After I had made my uturn and parked, the craft then started moving again and crossed the highway once more and all of a sudden disappeared.  It did not descend or ascend, it just went out of sight completely.   When I first saw the craft I thought it was plane due to a blinking light in the center, then noted it could be a helicopter as the light pattern didn't look typical.  Then noted it couldn't be a helicopter due to the fact it was traveling so smoothly.",

      "story": "Afternoon sighting. While doing errands on a sunny afternoon, I took note of the faintly lit moon in the sky at 3:45 p.m..   I then noticed a metallic cigar or rectangular shaped object to the west of the moon, traveling northwest at a slow speed, and low enough to see it was not an airplane.  It was hard to distinguish its shape.   I pulled the car over for a focused view, but still could not determine its exact shape.   Then I saw a second object traveling close to it, in the same direction.  The objects moved closer together and seemed to merge.   I turned my car around to follow them and by the time I got turned they were gone. My family is generational Air Force.  I am a former flight attendant, and I have been an observant sky watcher for many years.   This is my second daytime sighting; the other was in central California.  I have also observed 2 orange-colored orbs moving southwest from my area of the city\u2019s ridge.",

My home is on a ridge overlooking the river and entire city of Chattanooga.  From the second story, my children and I look at the city lights out the window as they are put to bed.   Today I saw a light I have never noticed before and it did not seem to move.  I watched from one room and never saw the object move.  I thought I was losing it, so I went to the opposite side of the house and looked and it was still there.  At this time I noticed a secondary object appear.  They were both white at that time.   I looked for my husband, couldn't find him, went downstairs and out the front door.  The two objects were still there, only this time moving slowly toward my house and higher as they went.  They moved in unison and the color started changing from one to many colors-- the entire outer rim of the objects were changing colors.  I kept rubbing my eyes thinking my contacts were drying out, but the lights were glowing and changing, and at this point I could see the lights were in triangle shapes around the object.  I couldn't make out the edges of the objects, only the lights.   Then, after they passed my house I lost sight of them because my house blocked my direct line of sight.  When I rediscovered them after running around the house they were much further to the left and had made a major change of direction.  Then there was only one; the second disappeared.   About 15 years ago, I saw a red orb in the middle of the day hovering in Athens, TN, over the interstate.",
